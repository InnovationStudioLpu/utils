My mother is a Grandmaster at the seventh realm, and my father is the only Marshal Saint at the 10th realm in the world. However, I am a waste with extremely poor aptitude at this moment, lying in the swaddling clothes. I am trying hard to recall everything that happened. It turns out that before my death, I unexpectedly activated the reversal life system and transmigrated back to when I was 2 years old. Before I could think too much, the system issued a task: try to make my father, Lu Chang Ching, show a hint of a smile. The task reward is a Dao embryo pill, which can transform one's body in Bones.
So, I reluctantly stood up. My mother, Yuyo, noticed my movement, feeling both surprised and delighted. "Shaol Lu, you are awake? Do you feel better?" she quickly touched my forehead, took my temperature, and breathed a sigh of relief when everything was normal. I raised my head and glanced at Bayu, Yuyo. She smiled, trying to reassure her that I was fine.
All right, my dear, I'm finally better.
Then, she picked me up in her arms. "Shaol, you scared me to death." I opened my mouth but couldn't say anything, only making babbling sounds.
At this moment, a loud noise came from outside, followed by a group of people. The middle-aged man leading them had a heroic appearance with a thick beard, followed by a group of doctors. They approached and examined me with various instruments, quickly confirming that I was indeed healed.
The middle-aged man let out a sigh of relief and then started chatting with Bayu, Yuyo. "It seems like Shalo can understand me now and even speak. He's not just a burnt fool anymore. He's become clever. Is it true? Is this really happening?"
Look, Shalu, you this is your dad. Call him Dad.
I looked at the gentle expression on the graceful woman's face, then at the expectant look on the middle-aged man's face. I hesitated for a moment and finally called out, "Dad."
Upon hearing this, Lu Ching's eyes widened instantly, and he was overjoyed, unable to contain his happiness. He couldn't help but look at the people around him, grinning from ear to ear. "Sha Lu, you called me Daddy, Sha Lu, you called me Daddy!"
At that moment, a prompt appeared before my eyes. I blinked, finding it hard to believe. Could it really be this simple? After taking the Dao Dan, it can help people to completely transform and rebuild their Foundation. This is a rare treasure in the world. Just one pill can change a person's Destiny Against All Odds. I couldn't help but be amazed by the effects of this pill. Upon careful consideration, it made sense. Being such a waste at 40 years old, the first reward for completing a task naturally had to be this type of pill. Otherwise, how could the counterattack be achieved?
Soon, the text on the system panel reappeared. "You have successfully made Lu Chang Xang, who hasn't smiled in 30 years, smile. However, this alone is not enough. Please spar with your Marshal Saint father and successfully hit him. Mission reward: innate sword intent."
Thinking of the miraculous effects of The Dao embryo pill, the reward for this second task immediately made me somewhat excited. Afterwards, I looked around, trying to see if there were any handy weapons. Lu Chang Xang looked at me and quickly asked, "Shaol Lu, where do you want to go?"
I spoke up, "Down, Lu Changing."
Lu Changing nodded and carefully set me down. Then, I staggered to my pile of toys, found a plastic toy sword, and waved it towards Lu Chang Xang, making "yaha" sounds at the same time.
Lu Changing looked at this scene with interest and asked, "Shaol Lu, do you want to learn swordsmanship?"
I replied, "Fight!" while gesturing. Lu Changing finally understood that Shaol Lu wanted to spar with him. I happily clapped my hands. "All right, all right, Lu Changing!"
He nodded happily and started playing around with his son. Under Lu Chang Xing's ultimate release of water, just 10 seconds later, I stabbed him with a sword. Lu Chang Xing fell to the ground with an "oops" and said, "Sha Lu, you knocked down Daddy."
I couldn't help but smile happily. "Good, that's it! Another light curtain appeared before my eyes. "Mission accomplished. Reward distributed: innate sword intent."
In that instant, various sword intents flashed through my mind, and the toy sword in my hand unconsciously carried a hint of sharpness. Lying on the ground, Lu Chang Xing sensed something was wrong. What's going on with the sword in his son's hand? He immediately got up and snatched the toy sword from me.
Lu Chang Xing looked at the toy sword in his hand, furrowing his brows involuntarily, as there seemed to be nothing unusual about it.
Chang Xang, what's wrong?
BYU Ya quickly asked when she noticed Lu Ching's reaction. There might be something wrong with this toy sword.
Lu Chan Chang spoke up, "Sword. I said, 'Sword.' I looked at the disappearing sword in my hand. "This sword is broken, Dad. Will buy you another sword, Lu Changing."
A month had passed in the blink of an eye. I gazed at my taskboard and couldn't help but let out a sigh. "You have successfully struck your father, Lu Chong Shen, even though 99 9% of it was due to your father holding back. Your own efforts played a part as well, but this is far from enough. Please earn the recognition of your father, the Marshal Saint, and show him your progress."
Task reward: innate dragon and tiger power. The reward for this task is very generous and quite simple. I'm just over a year old now, so it's really easy to gain Lu Ching's approval. But the problem is, after this task was triggered, Lu Chang Xing's expression became serious. He looked at me and said, "Shaol Lu, you have to work hard and become stronger. You can't always rely on the system's tasks. You have to grow up on your own and make your father proud."
I nodded, understanding the importance of his words. I knew that I had to work hard and become stronger, not just for the sake of completing the system's tasks but also for my own growth and development. I had to prove to my father that I was not a waste and that I could become a great martial artist like him.
As I continued to grow and train, I knew that the road ahead would be challenging, but I was determined to face it head-on and become the best version of myself. With the support of my family and the guidance of the reversal life system, I was confident that I could achieve my goals and make my father proud.

Xiang had already left home. Yu Ya told me that he had gone out to do something important related to the safety of Diaa and even the entire human race, so he didn't have time to accompany me. All I could do was wait quietly. It took a month for this.

During this time, I was thinking about how to gain Li Ching's approval without attracting too much attention. So, I made some noises, pointing at a children's book to catch Bayu Ya's attention. Bayu Ya walked over and said with a smile, "Little Lu, do you want to read? Mommy will read it to you, okay." After that, Bayu Ya patiently started reading "Little Duck."

When the story was finished, Bayu Ya pointed to the picture and asked, "Shia Luu, what do you see here?" I said, "Shia Luu is really smart. You're right, this is a little yellow duck."

Bayu Ya had a delighted expression. To outsiders, she was the Iceberg Goddess, a Grandmaster of the Seventh Realm of Marshal Da. But in front of Luu, she was just a mother. "What is this?" Bayu Ya asked again. Luu replied, "Bunny, it's the bunny. Little Luu is awesome."

Bayu Ya was surprised to find that her son seemed to have become even smarter. "What is it? Froggy, that's right, it's froggy, little froggy." Bayu Ya was very happy and kissed Luu fiercely. She then asked several more questions, and Luu answered them all correctly, making Bayu Ya even happier. Seeing Bayu Ya so happy, Luu felt happy himself, giggling and even immersed in the atmosphere. It was strange, but he didn't find it boring. He felt it was funny. Luu realized that this body was too small, so it relatively affected him. It was normal. Just as he had taken on the habits of a cat when he became a cat, now that he had become a child, he was of course affected by his body and gradually favored children. Luu couldn't say whether this was good or bad. If it was good, he could stop forcing himself to act like a child in the future because that kind of camouflage was not only awkward but also very tiring. If he could play it natively, he wouldn't be tired of pretending. And it wasn't like he was traveling through; he was just awakening memories of his past life. He was still the same.

Seeing that Luu was so smart, Bayu Ya began to read the story to him again. This time, Luu simply read alone. Despite being another month older, he still hadn't been able to utter a complete sentence. The babbling of learned words caught Bayu Ya's attention, and she couldn't help but smile. She then pointed to the words on the book, "This word, nenu, is Luu's name." Luu repeated, "Read, white, it's Mom's last name." Bayu Ya felt that it was very interesting and taught him like this. After being taught in this way, Bayu Ya began to ask questions and realized that Luu was actually able to answer them all. Bayu Ya was shocked at that moment and couldn't help but stare with wide eyes and a stunned expression.

Chapter 5: Showing Your Talent

The writing in this world was slightly different from the previous life but is much the same, can be said to have the same root, very recognizable. So, Luu didn't have much of a problem remembering it. However, in Bayu Ya's opinion, this was completely different. Such a small child, who had just learned to speak not long ago, could already recognize "little duck," "little rabbit," and "little frog." This was very powerful. How could literacy, which was much more complicated than the pictures, be remembered by a child? Bayu Ya was shocked. Could it be that her son is a genius? On second thought, it seemed very reasonable. After all, he was Li Ching's son, the first genius of the Great Summer Kingdom, the first 10 Realm Marshal Saint in human history, and the only Marshal Saint so far. The more top-notch powerhouses there were, the more difficult it was to procreate. And for so many years, only Luu, a soul seedling, had been born. So, it was normal for Luu to be slightly more genius. Parents are very good at convincing themselves. Bayu Ya quickly accepted this and brought another book over. This book was a compendium of animals, featuring a wide variety of animals and even some alien creatures. This was used by the Great Summer Kingdom to Enlighten small children. Originally, Luu was still a bit early to see it, but now Bayu Ya thought it was just right. She immediately began to teach Luu, sitting in her arms and looking at the animals attentively. There were people he knew and people he didn't know. After a while, Bayu Ya began to ask questions, and Luu answered them all. As Bayu Ya listened to the responses, a happy smile appeared on her face once again. Nothing made her happier than her own son being a genius. Bayu Ya confirmed one thing: Luu's memory was very good. Little Luu is so smart. Bayu Ya was so happy that she couldn't help but kiss Luu. "When your father comes back, he'll be very surprised." Luu thought this was the effect he wanted. If this couldn't get Li Ching's approval, he could only show his martial arts talent and even his sword talent. Ever since he ate the Da Embryo Dan a month ago, he had been...

Luu had been transformed and was no longer the scrappy child he once was. According to custom, children in this world usually develop until they are three years old before their roots and bones are examined and their talents are tested. Luu's original root and bone talent was very poor, but that one day, Dow Embrio Dan reversed everything. To say that he defied all odds would not be an exaggeration. Now, Luu was unsure of his own root and bone talent and in which class he would ultimately fall. It couldn't be too bad, though. Bay Yuya was very happy since Luu had shown his extraordinary abilities.  

Since Luu displayed his talent, Bay Yuya taught him even more every day, reading to him constantly, which made Luu's head spin. It was overwhelming for a child to be subjected to such intense education.  Luu found it very difficult and couldn't help but feel frustrated. "I'm only a one-year-old child!" he thought. "Even a chicken child isn't this pressured!"  He couldn't help but either run away or pretend to be dumb every time she read to him, which made Bay Yuya helpless. She also gradually calmed down and realized that she had been too much. Such words could easily cause a child's rebelliousness and should be introduced in an orderly and gradual manner.

Bay Yuya consulted with several people and realized that she had indeed been too hasty. Letting a child over a year old read and write was crazy. However, the fact that Luu had a superb memory and could already read and write had spread in the past two days. Many people came one after another. There were Elders from the Lou family and the B family. There were also some children older than Luu who looked at him with curious faces. Even Pops, whom he hadn't seen in a month, took time out of his busy schedule to make a trip home from the outer planets.

At this moment, a large family surrounded Luu: grandparents, grandma and grandpa, aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, and Li Chang who had just rushed back. Only to see Bay Yuya holding three words and asking Luu, "Little Luu, how do you pronounce these three words?" Luu glanced at the crowd, then at Bay Yuya, and finally at Lu Changxiang. His heart was helpless. He was only slightly displaying his talent! How did he cause such a big commotion? Even Pops, whom he hadn't seen in a long time, was back. But that was a good thing. He finally had a chance to finish the job. Then, in the presence of the large family, Luu spoke. The three words were quite literally his old man's name. When he pronounced these three words, the whole family cheered. Everyone was excited. Grandparents, grandmothers, and grandfathers all smiled. The aunts and uncles all applauded. My brother and sister all opened their mouths in surprise. Even Lu Changxiang looked surprised. Bay Yuya said proudly, "That's right, isn't it? You still don't believe me when I say my son can read and write?"

Looking at the crowd so excited, Luu was very tempted to say, "Sit down, sit down, please!" At the same time, he glanced at the progress of the mission. This task with Lu Changxiang's sentence was truly worthy of being his son. It was directly completed. Born with the power of dragons and tigers, it was in hand. Luu felt the constant stream of divine power and instantly didn't dare to move for fear of showing a little. Luckily, the power was quickly mastered, and there was no embarrassing situation where a gentle squeeze would break something.

At this moment, Lu Changxiang was very happy. He hugged Luu and said with a smile, "Haven't seen you for a month, did you miss Dad?" Bay Yuya on the side said, "Of course, I miss you. Almost every night, little Luu was calling out for Daddy, 'Where is Daddy?'" Hearing this, Lu Changxiang was a little heartbroken. There was no way he was just too busy. There were too many things to do. He just couldn't spare the time. "Little Luu, don't blame Daddy. Daddy has very important things to do outside, so there's no way he can stay with you all the time," Lu Changxiang said seriously to Luu. Luu seemed to understand and nodded. He seemed to understand what I'm saying. Lu Changxiang turned his head to Bay Yuya and said happily, "He then turned his head and looked at Luu once again. "Come on, call Daddy." Luu Lu Changxiang Lu Chong Shen by Yo ah!

A large group of people around them froze for the first time and then they all couldn't help but burst out laughing. Bay Yuya taught Luu that Lu Changxiang is his father's name, so Luu memorized those three words and knew that it was his father's name. Then it's straight to name-calling. Nothing wrong with it. Is this self-inflicted? Lu Changxiang instantly said with a bitter face and a helpless expression. "Although Lu Chang is my name, little Luu, you can't call me that. You have to call me Dad."



Chapter 6 The System is also Confused. 

Lu Changxiang did not continue to dwell on the matter of his son calling out his name. He turned his head to Bay Yuya. "Since little Luu can read and write, let's hire an enlightened teacher for him." Hearing this, Bay Yuya said with some surprise, "Isn't it too early? He's only a year and a half old." Luu, who was on the side, heard this and became a bit anxious. Bay Yuya reads to him every day, and he listens to a burst of headache.

Lu Chang Xang also invited an enlightened teacher to come, and Lu Yao spoke hastily, "But that's not a good idea, he's not old enough to learn yet. Besides, even if you don't want to learn, the older boy, around six or seven years old, also spoke up at this time. He was immediately whisked away by a ghostly cry, and Lu Chang Xang pondered for a moment before nodding, "Alright, let's wait until he's a little older and then hire him a teacher." By yuya agreed and said, "I've heard that learning should not be forced, but rather guided. Otherwise, it will lead to rebellion." "I'll buy some more picture books with enlightening readings and teach him through stories," she added. "Being a kid is boring - all they do is eat, play, sleep, and do nothing all day. I'm sure he wants to do more, but his brain is still developing, and he gets tired easily." Luu would spend most of his days lying in By yuya's arms, listening to her tell stories about enlightenment. Sometimes, By yuya would also share stories about her youth and the legendary deeds of Lu Chang Xang. This was the only way Luu could connect with the outside world, and he listened intently. By yuya was also surprised that Lu liked these stories so much, so she told him more through her narration. As a result, Luu's understanding of the world expanded immensely. In just over 2,000 years, the Marshall St. Lu Chang Xang age had seen nearly a thousand living planets occupied by humans, with 688 life planets in the hands of the Great SI. Not only did it occupy most of them, but many were still very rich planets, and the remaining scraps were distributed to other countries. This was naturally due to the Marshall St. Lu Chang Xang's unparalleled achievements as the first 10-realm Marshall Saint. As a reward, he had 38 private planets. In fact, Lu Chang Xang's family business was so enormous that it was outrageous. Of course, humans had enemies in the stars, countless alien races and evil gods. However, overall, the Human Side still had the advantage. The strength of these enemies was still not to be underestimated, and one must always be on the alert for their attacks. As Luu heard these words, he couldn't help but feel a little worried. If his own old man had an accident, and the only Human Marshall St. fell, then the situation of the entire human community would be very bad. Luu thought again, and there was a record in the system panel that the Marshall Saint Lu Chang Xang had not smiled for 30 years. Certainly not because of his untalented son, but for the sake of the entire human community, the entire human community nearly a thousand living planets rested on his shoulders alone. The weight was just too much. How many days and nights without peace? Where can I laugh? Luu was somewhat moved, and to think that he laughed so hard when he called him "daddy" was Luu silent for a while. By yuya felt a little amused as she looked at him in deep thought, and couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong? What are you thinking about?" "I want to grow up and share my worries for Dad," Luu said earnestly. By yuya froze when she heard this. To be honest, she hadn't really thought that Lu would be able to say something like that. He's so young, and he knows how to share his father's worries. By yuya nodded and said, "Then you have to work hard. This is not a simple matter at all." Luu nodded. Of course, he knew how difficult it was. The entire human race had only produced one Lu Chang Xang after so many years. Luckily, he was hung completing three missions in succession, and that had taken him off his feet for a little while. What about the next mission? Why hadn't it triggered yet? Could it be because the speed at which he completed the task was simply too fast, causing the system to notice something was wrong? It had to be said it's quite possible. Normally, if it was 40 years later, these three tasks to be completed would take at least several years. However, Lu had brushed it off and gave it a finish, simply speeding through. He was left with a feeling of crisis. He couldn't rely entirely on the system. He had to work hard himself. It was not desirable to lie completely flat, and so it was in these next days that Lu ruthlessly corrected his attitude and began to learn the words of this world. His learning speed was fast, making By yuya very surprised. In just one month's time, Lu was no longer satisfied with the content in the enlightenment picture book.

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

A last resort, BYU, you had some textbooks over for Luu to study in addition to recognizing words. Luu also tried to hold a pen and write some simple words when Luu's old Marshall, his father, came back a month later. He was so surprised that he couldn't keep his mouth shut after hearing about him. "You've been reading and writing since you were a year-old. Are your pants really that strong?" Although Lu Chang xang was a bit surprised, he accepted it very quickly. After all, his deeds were even more heaven-defying compared to that. Things like Luu knowing how to read and write were nothing at all. I didn't expect little Luu to be so smart. Lu Chonging touched Luu's and whispered, "Then, softly said, 'Shall I invite a teacher over for you?' Luu didn't refuse anymore, this time. He nodded, saying, "Why did you agree this time?" 

Lu Chang Shing was a bit curious because he grew up watching Luu take care of himself. Luu replied, "That answer made Lu Chang Shing's smile as he picked Luu up, and then he lifted Luu up, 'Our little Luu has grown up, he'll grow taller than Daddy.' Luu was lifted above his head, and he also felt this heavy expectation. Just then, the system next appeared, as seen in Chapter 7: Natural Ability to Forget, here we go. Finally, Luu couldn't help but have his eyes light up when he saw the mission appear and the trigger learning tasks. He had the approval of his father, the Marshall St Lu Chong xang, but that alone wasn't enough. He needed to gain the approval of more people. Next, please gain the approval of your teacher, Li Guang Thai, Quest reward, gifted ability can't forget. Luu stared at the panel and looked at the quest. His heart couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. It seems that the system didn't notice the problem and issued the quest as usual; that's good. Although Luu also thought that the worst outcome was for him to rise solely through his own efforts. But since he could rely on the system, it was natural for him to rely on it so ruthlessly if he didn't suffer. If he suffered, at least he'd have something to look forward to. That's not shabby. The rewards for this Quest weren't from the martial arts department, but they weren't bad either. The natural ability to see past your eyes once he was able to get this reward would then be an epic enhancement for Luu's memory. Learning many new things would become much easier. Luu loved it! Another month passed, although Lu promised Luu that he would find a teacher for him. But this teacher candidate was a problem after all. Luu was only one and a half years old. At that point in age, it was hard for the school to invite those famous teachers over. Of course, with Marshal Saint's name, they most likely wouldn't refuse. But Lu Chang xang also had his own considerations. He didn't want to just find a teacher for Luu; it was crucial to choose the right one. He couldn't just pick anyone, let alone pick and choose carefully. Luu wasn't able to say directly that it would be good for Lu Chang Shing to go to Li Guang Thai's as a teacher. We can only wait and see, as Lu Chang Shing would find out. Luu wasn't in a hurry; the speed of completing the tasks should not be too fast, or the system might find out he was gathering information quickly.

Another half a month had passed, and the season had entered winter. The teacher's choice was finally finalized. Liwang Thai; it's still him. Luu listened to Lu Chang Shing and by Yuya's chat when he heard the name. "I think luwan is good." He changed the subject, originally intending to hire Jingwan Chang. Lu Chang xang, she was very famous, and after hearing he was looking for a teacher for Luu, she even recommended herself. She was too proactive. Lu Chang chung opened his mouth and said, "Is it bad to take the initiative? ... Other people took the initiative, and you resented it instead" Bayyo said with a smile, "That's not that I'm speculating about others carelessly; I simply want to hire her as a teacher. If she wants to come over, that's not necessarily true. She's a member of the United faction; don't want my son to somehow become a part of it."

Lu Chang xang considered many things. He remembered that Li Guai, his college teacher, was an old friend of Luu's. Lu Chang xang changed the subject, "Yeah, Professor Lee. His only drawback is that his power and blood are slipping. But he should have no problem coming over to teach Luu." Chu nods. Luu listened to the conversation between the two from the side and learned from them that this teacher, by the way, was a master of the seventh realm of martial arts and a retired professor of Blue Star University. He was also Lu Chang xing's teacher. That he was almost impeccable in terms of character and teaching ability.

Soon after Lu Chang xing clapped his hands and decided to let Li Gui be Luu's teacher. After hearing about Luu's request, Leang Thai didn't hesitate and readily accepted. "If he could teach a second, Marshal Saint, then Leang Thai, the number one teacher of Blue Star, wouldn't be too much to ask."

Despite calling himself the foremost educator of the human race, Liang Tha acknowledged that it was nearly impossible. Lou, being the son of a marshal saint, was an exception, but even for him, the task was almost unattainable. For Luu's sake, Lu Chang xang organized a worship banquet at home. Luu soon sought his first teacher in this world, an old man with white hair named Hail and Hardy. As Luu scrutinized him curiously, Yuyo patted his head and suggested he pay his respects to his teacher. Luu bowed and performed the disciple salute according to the etiquette that Bay Yuyo had taught him the night before.

Upon meeting Teacher Li Guang Tai, Luu's intelligence surprised him. "This son of yours is remarkably intelligent," Li Guang Tai commented, astonished that a child of only 1 and a half years old could perform such a salute. The mission had been completed, and Luu had gained the recognition of his teacher, Li Guang Tai. As a reward, he was granted an unforgettable natural ability.

Luu, still trying to maintain a low profile, contemplated dragging out the process a little longer. Who would have thought that he would perform the salute of worship so quickly, completing his mission before he could even show his full potential? The system had advanced to 40 years, making these quests easier. Luu couldn't help but smirk, knowing that the system was gathering more information and he was on his way to becoming invincible.

Lu Chang Chang left the room, leaving Li Guang Tai and Luu alone. A normal child would have cried when their parents were gone, but Luu remained calm. Rangai stroked his beard and squatted down to ask little Luu what he wanted to learn. Luu replied without hesitation, "I want to learn martial arts."

Li Guang Tai smiled and asked why. "I want to be strong," Luu explained. Hearing this, Rangai nodded and said, "At your current age, it's not the time to learn martial arts. You're too young to practice martial arts at this time. Not only will it not have much effect, but there are also side effects that will affect your growth and development, and you won't be able to grow taller in the future. So, when can I learn martial arts? At the very least, you can't touch martial arts until you're 3 weeks old."

Luu felt so far away, being only a year and a half old now. He frowned and pondered for a while before speaking. "Then I'll study literature." It just so happened that he had been given the natural ability to forget everything, so if he used it to learn literature, it wouldn't be a burden.

Li Guang Tai naturally couldn't teach college students, but he made corresponding changes to teach a small child. Luu was not generally intelligent, but he had a more responsive mind than the average four or five-year-old. It was still Luu's performance that was impressive, and if he hadn't deliberately kept a low profile, it would have been even more amazing.

Another month passed, and the weather grew colder and colder, with snowflakes slowly falling from the sky. The house remained warm enough that even wearing short sleeves felt hot. Luu estimated the time; it should be almost Spring Festival. In this world, there was a holiday after the New Year, and Luu would be an imaginary 3 years old, even though he was only 1 year and 7 or 8 months old. After all this time, the next Quest still hadn't triggered. Luu wasn't in a hurry; he just followed Li Guang Tai and studied every day in this High Marshall world. Not only were people's Force values explosive, but their technological advancement was far more advanced than in the previous world. Interstellar migration was not possible for humans without sufficiently strong technological support, so people in this era needed to learn not only martial arts but also a lot of cultural knowledge. It could be very hard work.

On this day, Luu looked at the snowflakes outside the house, and his thoughts drifted a bit. Seeing Luu in a daze, Li Guang Tai stopped him and said, "Your rate of progress is very fast, and if it continues like this, I'm afraid that next year, you will finish the elementary school program like I have never seen before."

Lu Chang Chang's son, Luu, was not just an ordinary child prodigy. He was the only son of the Marshall Saint, a title held by only one person in the 2,000-year history of the Star Marshall era. It was no surprise that Luu was a bit rebellious, given the immense power his father held.

Rangai, one of Luu's companions, tried to convince himself that it was normal for Luu to be a bit contrary, given his father's status. Even Yu Ya and Lu Chang Xang, Luu's parents, seemed to agree.

As the New Year approached, Li Guang Tha, Luu's teacher, mentioned that he would be going home for the holidays. Luu was saddened by this news, as he had grown fond of his teacher over the past month. Li Guang Tha had been gentle with him and had never spoken a harsh word. He was also incredibly knowledgeable, able to answer any question Luu asked.

Luu wondered if he would miss his teacher during the New Year celebrations. Li Guang Tha reassured him that he could always call him on the communication phone and that he would return as soon as the holidays were over.

Just as Luu was getting bored, a new quest was triggered. He was tasked with defeating his childhood companion, the sixth realm Grandmaster Yaning. Luu was skeptical, as Yaning was only a year or two older than him and not yet able to practice martial arts. However, he was determined to complete the mission and earn the reward of a realm-breaking pill.

As the New Year approached, the Marshall Saint residence was filled with excitement. Lu Chang Shang even took the time to come home for the holidays. Luu met a number of cousins and learned more about his family's history as a martial arts family. He also discovered that Yaning was the youngest son of his mother's classmate, Yu. Despite being only three years old, Yaning was already a powerful martial artist.

Luu was determined to defeat Yaning and complete his mission. He knew it would not be easy, but he was up for the challenge. As the New Year rolled around, Luu's classes stopped and his teacher went home. The Marshall Saint residence was filled with joy and celebration, but Luu had his sights set on a different goal. He was determined to become a powerful martial artist like his father and defeat his childhood companion.

Chapter 9: A Brand New Day

You found Miss Luu staring at Guanin, who was sitting in the corner, contemplating with a blank expression. He appeared a bit dull.

Luu opened her mouth and asked, "Are you Yanguan Ching?"

As soon as Yanguan Ching heard the voice, he snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the person in front of him. He nodded and said, "Yes, it's me."

Luu asked again, "How old are you?"

Yanguan Ching replied, "I'm four years old. I've learned a little martial arts. Can I see it?"

Luu asked, "You're not three years old yet, are you? You can't learn martial arts until you're three."

Luu clarified, "I'm not planning on learning martial arts. I just want you to show me the basics."

Yanguan Ching replied, "Of course, I've learned. I don't believe you if you say I haven't."

Luu insisted, "If you've learned it, why won't you show it?"

Yanguan Ching explained, "I just haven't learned yet."

Luu said, "Fine, I'll show you. But remember, little children are just beginning to learn. Don't be easily fooled."

After Luu finished demonstrating, she immediately said, "That's it. It's not that good."

Yanguan Ching felt offended and asked, "Do you know who my father is? How dare you say that my martial arts are not good!"

Yanguan Ching boasted, "These few moves were taught to me by my father, the Eighth Realm Marshall King, known as the Invincible."

Luu smiled and asked, "Then do you know who my father is?"

Yanguan Ching hesitated and asked, "Who is your father?"

Luu replied, "My father is the Tenth Realm Marshall Saint, the only one in the Star Marshall Calendar for 2,000 years."

Yanguan Ching was silenced. He couldn't believe that the arrogant brat in front of him was actually the only son of the Marshall Saint.

After a long silence, Yanguan Ching said with a stiff upper lip, "Your father is a Marshall Sage, but what does it have to do with you? What gives you the right to say that my martial arts are not good?"

Luu nodded and said, "That makes perfect sense. You're not just any three or four-year-old."

Luu challenged, "Come and fight me. Let me see how good you are."

Yanguan Ching couldn't help but laugh out loud and asked, "Are you afraid of me?"

Luu asked, "How could I possibly be afraid of you?"

Yanguan Ching said, "I'm afraid of crying and then getting a beating from my father. That's not worth it."

Yanguan Ching said, "I can still distinguish between the lesser and the greater. I think you're just scared."

Luu said, "I'm really not afraid. You're just scared."

Yanguan Ching agreed, "Then let's have a contest. It's a deal. You're not allowed to cry."

Luu smiled and nodded.

Once again, the two found an unoccupied room and began to spar.

Yanguan Ching thought to himself, "Don't lay a heavy hand on him. He's the only son of the Marshall Saint. If he's injured, it's not a joke."

However, even if he held back, it wouldn't be easy to bully this little guy.

Yanguan Ching was knocked to the ground a moment later. He was a little unresponsive and had no idea what was going on. He was already on the ground, as if he had been beaten.

Yanguan Ching quickly got up and said unconvincingly, "You're not bad, but this time I'm going to be serious. So you must be careful."

Luu nodded.

Soon, another slap sent Yanguan Ching to the ground again.

Yanguan Ching was a bit skeptical this time. He saw Luu strike with just a light slap that directly knocked him to the ground. He thought to himself, "Something must have gone wrong somewhere."

Yanguan Ching stood up once more and said, "I underestimated you this time. I definitely won't let you win easily."

Luu smiled and nodded.

Another slap, and this time, Luu put just the right amount of intensity to rip off the brain without hurting it.

Yanguan Ching's entire body froze.

He shouted in a hurry, "You admit defeat, admit defeat. Convinced, convinced. Good, then call me Big Brother and listen to me. But you're younger than me, and you can't beat me. But still, you want a beating, Big Brother."

Luu nodded with great satisfaction.

By this time, the mission had naturally been completed, and the reward came straight to hand.

Pills for breaking the boundary level six, of perfect quality, Type consumable.

Effects after taking it: it can help one break through bottlenecks and raise the upper limit of one's realm.

Description: this is a superb Elixir, but it is not omnipotent. It is only recommended for martial artists below the seventh realm. Martial artists in the seventh realm and above will have minimal effect after using it.

Luu nodded his head after looking at the description of this realm-breaking pill. This reward was not bad.

Although the martial arts quest was only suitable for practitioners below the seventh realm, Luu hadn't started training officially, and he didn't know when he'd break through. Immediately after completing this quest, a new system quest appeared. Luu eagerly read the panel: Special Assignment - Luu had not only defeated his rival but also made him acknowledge him as his elder brother. This reminded Luu of his childhood companions. To progress, Luu needed to gain recognition from more of these friends, making them all acknowledge him as their leading brother. The quest was titled "Revitalize the Reputation of the Sons of the Marshall Sage."

The rewards were based on the number of companions recognized: 
10 companions - a lower-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure
20 companions - a medium-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure
50 companions - a top-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure
100 companions - a top-quality Heaven and Earth Treasure

This quest was staged, and most rewards were available if the quest was completed well enough. The time frame for completion was one month, and Luu was currently at 1110th place. This quest was unique as it was divided into phases. Luu's eyes lit up when he saw the panel's progress, indicating he had completed 1/10th of the task.

Luu realized that this mission was one of the most challenging he had accomplished so far. Relatively speaking, it would be difficult if compared to his past experiences, but in the present context, it was only slightly harder than previous tasks.

As Luu contemplated, Yaning, his younger brother, sensed his brother's brooding and asked why. Luu explained that he wanted to make a significant contribution to revitalize his community and lighten his father's burden. However, he lacked enough people under his command. Luu asked Yaning about finding more manpower.

Yaning suggested that Luu could recruit from the numerous guests present, including relatives and children of Luu's relatives. Luu appreciated Yaning's input and assigned him the task, surprising Yaning. Yaning admitted that while he was willing, he wasn't confident in his abilities. Luu reassured him that this was a simple matter and provided a strategy to invite guests for dinner and drinks, thanking them for their visit.

Yaning understood and set out to invite people, while Luu prepared for their arrival at the Yao Guang Pavilion. Although some adults noticed Luu's actions, they didn't interfere.

We were not at all concerned about Luu's nonsense and were even a bit happy to see it. After all, it was good for his own son and daughter to have more contact with the Marshall Saints' only son. When Li Chang Xang found out about this, he inevitably couldn't help but treat it as a child's nonsense and didn't try to stop it. Yugan Ching's mobilization ability was good, and with Luu's invitation as the young Master, it was even more like a tiger with wings. Few people did not give face in just a moment inside Yagang Pavilion, a bunch of people had gathered.
Luu glanced over, "Good Lord, at the very least, hundreds." Luu sat on the main seat because of his height, which was too short, and could only barely show ahead. This was really no momentum, and the field of vision was not good. Lou You thought about it directly and stood on the chair so it was just right.
Inside the Yagang Pavilion, as the crowd took their seats, Luu did not shy away from the stage and stood on his chair to look around at the crowd along with the Gaze sweeping originally there was still some noise in the hall, but gradually quieted down. Everyone looked at Luu with considerable interest. Yaning sat next to Luu and was even more expectant.
Luu thought for a moment and spoke, "I invited you all to Yagang Pavilion to celebrate the Gathering of all your family and friends here. Come, I'll toast everyone first." Saying so, Luu lifted his wine glass, and the people in the room following suit, similarly lifted their glasses. It's not wine in this glass, naturally, but juice. Luu directly drank it all in one go, and everyone dried up this juice.
Outside Yagang Pavilion, there were a few passing Marshall Kings who saw the scene and almost one of them didn't hold back and laughed outright. This group of children, brother, the big one is about 10 years old, the small one is simply only two or three years old, at this moment gathered here to hold a banquet, looks quite decent. Really makes people can't help but laugh. There were also Marshall Kings who thought of some of the stupid things they had done when they were young and couldn't help but lament, "It's good to be young."
The group had a tacit understanding; none of them went over to disturb. At most, they just watched from afar. After Luu drank a cup of juice, he glanced at the crowd again and then opened his mouth to ask everyone, "Doesn't need to be formal, just sit down and eat and drink."
Yuguan Chung glanced at Luu and thought to himself, "Brother, isn't going to do anything yet? Luu, however, glared at Yuguan Chung, telling him to stay out of trouble and not to spoil things. Yug Waning shrunk his neck and, at the same time, he was also a bit curious as to what kind of medicine Luu was selling in this gourd.
Luu waved his hand and continued, "I heard my teacher say something about the current state of the human Community as well as the situation of War around the world, and he mentioned a lot of drawbacks. Then, he placed his hopes on young people like me, saying that he could only clarify the world when I grew up. My teacher, you may have heard of him. He's an honorary professor of Blue Star University, Li Guang Tha. If Li Guang Tha were here, I'm afraid he would be dumbfounded when did I say this? How could I possibly say that to you? This was purely open-mouthed offthe cuff nonsense, but it was still very convincing when placed in a group of children. After all, Luu had even said his name.
Of course, there were some people who were a bit puzzled. Even Luu's old man, Marshall Saint Lu Chang Xang, couldn't do it, so what made him able to do it? To this, Luu gave an answer. No matter how powerful the Marshall Saint is, there is only one one person cannot change the nature of the whole society. It requires the concerted efforts of a group of people.
Luu waved his hand and continued, "I invited everyone here today just to discuss great things together. All of you are the hope of the future. Whether or not the future can clarify the universe cannot be accomplished by me alone. Even if I break through to the Marshall Saint Realm, I still cannot do those. My incompetent Marshall Saint old man is an example of that. But just because he can't, doesn't mean we can't. And that's the main reason I pulled you guys over. Heroes and heroines, the future requires all of us to work together. In order to clarify the Jade change the heavens and the Earth and make great Endeavors that have never been seen before, I wonder what do you guys think about this?"
Lou You looked at the crowd with a burning gaze as the crowd listened to Luu's words. They were all confused. No one had expected that Luu had asked them to come over for this. To clarify the world, change the heavens and the Earth, and make great Endeavors that have never been seen before. What a mind-blowing thing to do. If it were some adults who heard these words, they would most likely be indifferent or even scoff and find them too absurd. This world, how can it be changed? So well.
If it was a group of teenagers at this moment, most of them felt hot blooded and could not wait to give action. But at this moment, within the Yagang Pavilion, the oldest was just a 10-year-old kid. Brother, the first feeling everyone had when they heard this was confusion. The second feeling was fun. The third feeling was that it could be with. At this moment, outside Yagang Pavilion, the passing Marshall Kings watched from afar, shaking their heads and laughing.

The Yagang Pavilion was bustling with Marshall Kings who exchanged glances after hearing these words. What did they just hear? These brats want to change the sky and clarify the Jade—was this a rebellion? Are kids nowadays so bold? It’s too much of a mental state to be ahead of the game. It’s obviously a very funny thing, but it’s not even funny because in their future, they do have this potential. The person at the head was the only son of a Marshall Saint, while the others were either from martial arts families or the sons of Marshall Kings and martial Emperors. The worst was the son of a great Master. Any one of them, when placed outside, would be a significant son or a young lady. When they grow up, they will still be truly unlimited. I just don’t know if they will remember what they are saying now. As people grow and change, even the strongest thoughts can be loosened. Just now, outside, watching the parents, it seems that these people are also very chicken. The Thief from the Hidden Figure did not let the people inside find out about the outside. The Yagang Pavilion saw that the crowd didn’t react much, and Lu You slapped the table and asked, “Are you all rats? Why don’t you say anything?” The simple provocation immediately had an effect, and someone stood up and said, “I’ve heard from my dad that the group army stationed in the Tianlong Starfield has a serious corruption problem.” The man who spoke was a little chubby guy, and Lu Youu remembered his name, Chin Yun Li. Come, tell us, Luu’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly opened his mouth, “I have to say, the gift of unforgettaball to my dad. I’m afraid that the number of troops stationed on Ton Longstar is only 1 million or even less than 1 million, but the number they reported is surprisingly 3.8 million. This is an incomparably horrifying gap. Just to embezzle military expenses and drink soldiers’ blood, there are quite a few people who know about this, but no one dares to poke it out. One or two are so covered up. Wait until something really happens in the future, that’s a stone’s throw away. Chin Yunai even subconsciously mimicked his own dad’s tone when he said these words. These words, which he had accidentally heard, were spoken directly at this moment without much thought. As Luu listened to these words, he only felt shocked to the core. The system is corrupt and riddled with ills, and there is no exception in any world or country. This world was already 2,000 years into the Star Marshall calendar, and there were sure to be countless problems that were so intertwined and involved that they simply couldn’t be easily solved by one or two people. As Luu had said, even if his dad, Lu Chang Xiang, came, it would be difficult to eradicate it. The 10 Realm Marshall Saint was indeed very strong, but no matter how strong he was, he was only one person and still seemed a bit weak in the face of the entire system. Teacher Li Guangtai also talked about these issues, but at the time, he just mentioned them casually and did not go any further. Luu, however, remembered those words. He hadn’t realized that the problems had been so serious. I can’t believe I’ve asked such a big thing just by casually asking. Asking myself, just at this time, a little girl stood out and spoke, “I’ve also heard my father say that the biggest religion of the Great Summer Country, the Divine Light Cult, is suspected to have an unsettling and tearing connection with the Extraterrestrial evil God. The Divine Light Cult, with 10 billion followers, is spread all over the major planets. If they are disposed of, the consequences should not be too horrible. Because this is a major event that shakes the foundation of the country, so we can only turn a blind eye to it and hope that that extraterrestrial evil God does not have any malice towards humans. Another stone-cold event, and that’s just the beginning. Soon, one powerful secret after another was told by these kid brothers. Meanwhile, outside the Yagang Pavilion, the Marshall Kings and martial Emperors who were planning to watch this group of kid brothers party and reminisce about their youth revealed an expression of having seen a ghost. No, it’s even scarier than seeing a ghost because one thing this group of kids said was more horrifying than the next. If they were involved, even if they were Marshall Kings and martial Emperors, they wouldn’t be able to do much good. Originally thought to just look at the fun, it was neither a good idea to leave nor a bad idea not to leave. Something some secret that even they don’t know yet at the moment was even by this group of children, random chat. No, no, don’t. Their parents know how to keep something this important a secret. How can you just casually say that in front of your own little kids? Don’t they realize how much of a furor this would cause if it leaked out? Of course, from another point of view, even if a child says it, it doesn’t seem to be a big deal. One thing, children’s words are not taken seriously. Secondly, the major families had completely controlled the channels of vocalization, and even if they said it, they would not be able to spread it on a large scale, and they would even immediately address those who attempted.

To spread it, making it disappear without a trace, but the thing is, even if that's the case, you shouldn't just say it outright. Sure enough, the world is a giant straw man; any more scribbling will happen. This group of Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors couldn't help but wonder if they should go in and stop this party, or is it here a few more secrets? Chapter 12: Brave Luck, Suppressing Stone. As one secret after another comes to light, this group of kid brothers realized that the situation was not right. They found out things seemed really grim for the human community. What Luu said was really not a joke. Not only for D yya but for the entire human race, a critical moment of life and death had almost arrived. If they didn't step up and make some changes, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Inside the Yagang Pavilion, the faces of a group of small children all became somewhat serious. This look was adorable and somewhat hilarious, however, none of the Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors peeking outside could laugh. Some of them even got serious and wanted to see what the youngsters chose to do inside the hall. At the end of the table, Luu also felt that something was not quite right, and he realized that he might have stirred up a big blunder. He let too many secrets that couldn't be exposed come right out. Right now, there was probably someone out there listening in. Things seemed to be getting a little dicey. No, Luu's eyes became firm. What kind of trouble is this? How far has this gone back? In the beginning, he dared to blurt out that phrase, "My No Good Marshall Saint Father," and now, in the face of these problems, these troubles, he wants to back down? You've got a headache, scared shitless if you don't even have the guts to do that, you can't even talk about clarifying YuYu. My father is the great Summer Marshall Sage.

Luu once again looked around at the crowd and spoke, "All of you should also understand just how bad the situation of the Granda and even the entire human community is right now, and understand that my words at the beginning were not a joke. In the future, we need to clarify the Jade together as a group and change the heavens and the Earth together. Only by doing so will we, the human race, have a future." Luu is not talented and is willing to take the brunt of the responsibility to bring everyone together to change the human community. I wonder if everyone is willing to recognize me as a big brother, and if they are willing together to change the heavens and the Earth."

When these words came out, the crowd could not help but freeze. Although it was said that Luu was very powerful at this little age, he had such insight, but wasn't he a little too young? It felt weird to recognize him as a big brother at this time. Yu Guan Ching, who had been dumbfounded, finally reacted and directly stood up, saying loudly with a serious face, "I, Yu Guan Ching, am willing to recognize you as a leading elder brother, and from now on, you must lead me to change Dasha and change the entire human community, save the fate of mankind."

When Luu heard this, he looked at Yu Guan Ching appreciatively. "Not bad, not bad. He didn't even remind him; he knew to take the lead in talking. Well done, worthy of being the first little brother he took in." When the crowd heard this, it was like a dream. Someone spoke up on the spot, "I am also willing. I, Chin Yu Li, am willing to recognize you as my big brother and lead us to change the heavens and the Earth together." The little chubby Pirin Yunai followed and opened his mouth just because Luu remembered his name, he was willing to follow Luu. Subsequently, the little girl Chu Kaning, who was speaking behind Chin Yu Li, followed suit. One, two, three, there would be more people, and as more and more people recognized Luu as their leader and worshipped him as their leading brother, almost everyone subconsciously followed and worshipped Luu as their leading brother.

When the crowd scrambled to follow Luu, he was a little happy but also felt a little heavy. It was a very strange feeling, and to be honest, he didn't expect it to be like this at first. Luu's thoughts were simple; he was just trying to complete the mission and grip the wool of the system. That's all he didn't think too much at all, but at the moment when things have come to this point, the nature seems to have changed a bit. All the things he said, all the promises he's made, is it all just a bunch of pretend? He admitted he is still very small, a small child. After all, the virtual age is only 3 years old, the actual age is only 1 year and 8 months. These words of course cannot be completely forgotten when nothing has happened. Other people will not say anything at most laugh at a childish talk, but in this world, everything comes with a price, and the next time Luu tries to do this, it will be hard for others to recognize him. Moreover, Luu's heart couldn't get over it, so those words, those promises were definitely not just words. Since he was the only son of the Marshall Saint and came from such a privileged background, there were certain things that were incumbent upon him. What's more, he's turned on in this way, the sky will be changed, and the Jade will be clarified. Who else can do it? The moment as more and more people recognized him after...

Recognizing him as his big brother, lines of text kept appearing in front of his eyes. The first stage of the mission had been completed, and he had been acknowledged by ten companions. He had acquired a rare treasure, the Heaven and Earth Vermilion Fruit, which was of Yugo level sixth-order quality. This perfect type of consumable item had several effects after being consumed: it could strengthen the physical body, improve cultivation, and enhance physique to a certain extent. 

Description: 100 years of leaves, 100 years of flowers, 100 years of fruits, 300 years of mature heaven and earth wonders. However, it should be noted that if the physical body is not strong enough, do not take it casually, otherwise there is a certain probability of bursting and dying.

The second stage of the mission had been completed, and he had been acknowledged by twenty companions. He had acquired a medium-grade Heaven and Earth treasure, the Pichy Lucky Stone. This excellent type of wearable item had several effects: it could turn misfortune into good luck, calm the heart, ward off evil spirits, open up luck, and attract wealth and treasures at the root of the matter. It could also increase the luck of the person wearing it.

Description: The brave man with different forms, inner and outer, eating and not pulling the ancient auspicious beast. This one strangely shaped stone vaguely had the breath of a brave man and seemed to bear a trace of the power of a brave man's divine soul.

This was the end of the panel text. Lou couldn't help but stare, wondering about the top-quality Heaven and Earth wonders and the top-quality Heaven and Earth treasures, how come they were gone, could the system still be privatized? L was a bit puzzled and, after taking a closer look, immediately knew the reason. 

The progress of the mission was 2350, at this moment, which meant that out of the 100 people, only 23 had genuinely acknowledged him as their leader. The others were just following the trend. Although he had recognized him as his elder brother on his lips, he didn't truly approve of him in his heart. L was surprised, but when he thought about it carefully, it was normal. He had said some words and done nothing, yet he wanted to gain the recognition of so many people and make them follow with sincerity, which was simply a foolish errand.

The reason why these people came here and were willing to recognize him as their big brother was, to a large extent, because Lu's Dad was a Marshal Saint. The fact that there were 23 people who could genuinely recognize L as what was surprising was that children are just so easy to fool. Of course, there is another possibility, that among these people, those who are considered L's companions are actually not many. I have to say it's quite possible.

Chapter 13: I am not yet strong. If I am strong, there is a change. This was known to Marshall Saint Lu Changchang in no more than a moment. Lu Changchang initially thought that it was just a bunch of kids fooling around. What could be wrong? Is it possible to break the sky? It turned out that this group of kids was really going to break the sky, one secret after another was exposed.

It is said that children's words are not harmful, but behind them stood a group of Marshall King, Marshall Emperors. If their parents didn't say any of this, how could they have made it up? Believability is simply not good enough. Right. Lu Changchang couldn't help but cover his forehead when he heard this news. As the only Marshall Saint of the human community, usually going around to put out fires, he was already very tired, and the New Year's Eve this moment of effort had thought to be able to take a rest, but the result was that this group of little brats in the twinkling of an eye stabbed out such a big basket.

Their parents were also big-hearted, and these things they could say in front of these children. Lu Changqing was tired for a while, and the news that came afterward was more than enough to make Lu Changching cry and laugh. A bunch of brats actually wanted to clarify the Jade and change the sky and Earth; what a big mouth; do they know what it really means to do this? Just how big a price to pay? How dare they just say something like that?

What made Li Chang Ching most helpless was that this matter was brought up by his precious son, Lou you, and also let all the people recognize him as the leading elder brother and in the future they will follow him to change the sky and the Earth. At that time, Lu Changchang started cursing in his heart. Normally, I don't see Lou you having such ambition, and the bottom line is he's only 3 years old, you're only a year and 8 months old, aren't you? How can you actually say something like that? It's more like being the leader of a bunch of brats for a while.

Lu Ching's heart was pounding and his mind was full of mixed feelings, even though Lu you had surprisingly stirred up such a big basket, these were not really big problems for Lu Changxang. He knew some of those dirty and sorted things about the great SI as well as the entire human Community only this time it was poked into the open by his own son and a bunch of brats. Since this was the case, Lu chaning couldn't pretend that he hadn't seen these things much less that nothing had happened if he really did that.

He couldn't become a true 10th level Marshall saint now that it was known and made public. There had to be an accounting for it, simply because of who he was - the great Marshall Saint Lu Chong Xang was unexpectedly a bit relieved and even more so, he was vaguely proud, as expected, he was worthy of being my "protector". Starting to stir up the wind and clouds at such a young age, haha. There is a shadow of me back then, however, since he had made such a big mess, he couldn't be rewarded categorically. Lu Chan Chang told Yuel all about this news as well as the series of events at that time. By Yu Ya's face was a wonderful sight. Then Lu was out of luck that night. Lu's ass went straight to Blossom. "Let's get you clarified, Yu Yu. Make you change your mind. Let you take the lead", the Big Brother was still fooling around, BYU.

Yao angrily asked for such a long time. It was the first time Lu You saw Bay Yu Ya's angry face, and it looked like she was really angered, so her hands were a bit heavy. Lu Yu took this beating but didn't change his mind as he raised his head and said, "I'm not a 2-year-old anymore, you can't treat me like a child anymore, not a 2-year-old but a 3-year-old, right." Hearing this, Bay Yu Ya was instantly infuriated and couldn't help but ask, "You're so young, what do you know? It's because you're Lu Ching's son that you're exempt from the chastisement, just let me teach you a lesson, if you were someone else's son, this matter wouldn't have ended so simply. Do you know what you're doing, of course I know what I'm doing, BL. You said rightfully, I want to share my father's worries, but I feel there are some things that one person definitely can't do, so I'm uniting all the forces that I can." 

By Yu Ya recited these words silently in her mind and was inevitably a little surprised, but she did not let Lu Yu off the hook because of this. Just a softer voice as he spoke, it's just that by doing this, you're making trouble for your father, father, not sharing his worries, can you understand? The understood Lu Yu said, since you understand, then you're going to do it again in the future. By Yu Ya asked again, could it be that I caused all this trouble? Lu Yu raised his head and asked, "Isn't it, by Yu Ya asked rhetorically. I'm just a 3-year-old child, when did I have that much power?"

Lu Yu spread his hands with a helpless face. By Yu Ya couldn't help but stare and also instantly reacted, the trouble certainly wasn't caused by Lu Yu, the trouble itself was there, it's just that everyone had been treating it as if they didn't see it, and now it was being poked out by a bunch of kids. Strictly speaking, these troubles were not caused by Lu Yu, this logic was very simple, but by by Yu Ya was after all an adult and a 7th level Grandmaster, so she wouldn't be so simply sidetracked. Thus ignoring Lu Yu's side of the issue, By Yu Ya looked at Lu Yu shook her head and said with a smile, "It's not like that, what you said makes sense, but things don't work out that way. How does that work out? Lou, you asked. There are some things that don't need to be weighed three talents without being weighed, but if they are weighed, 1,000 pounds can't even be beaten".

By Yu Ya said, slowly, by her meaning was more direct. These problems if left unspoken, were not that serious, but once they were put in the open, it was not that simple. Lu Yu frowned and after a long time, slowly spoke. Whether it's put on the counter or not, whether it's weight or not, the weight won't change.

By Yu Ya was silent for a long while, sighed quietly and then explained, what you said makes sense, but the rules of this world's functioning, as well as the logic of its functioning, aren't that simple. There are some problems that can be solved, but there are some problems that are not easily solved, even if these problems are solved, I don't see that it will be a good result. The world, it's not black and white, it's black and white, and gray, can you understand this? Can you understand, this, Bay Yu Ya looked at her son her eyes carrying some depth. She thought to herself, hell, it would be strange if Lu Yu could understand all this. How could she have said so much? She really explained it all to Lu Yu, would it hurt his innocent heart? Nay, Lu Yu was really smart, if he didn't break it up for him and made it clear, he really couldn't realize his problem. By Yu Ya's gaze Lu Yu lowered his head, and seemed to understand his mistake, after a long time he looked up and said more firmly, "I am not yet strong, strong is a change".

By Yu Ya was once again exasperated and laughed. She didn't know where he had learned these words, how dare he talk back to her like this, do you really think she has no temper, at all. Nah, I've beaten scolded and reasoned but Lu Yu is still so stubborn, we can't beat it up again, can we.

If Lu Yu had been slightly older, then he definitely wouldn't have been merciful and would have beaten him again. The point is, Lu Yu is too young to fight like this. It was so hard to give birth to this one child.

Yu Yao could not bear to fight him, so she left Luu alone to reflect on himself. She then went to find Lu Chang Chang, a marshal sage, to discipline his son properly. Lu Chang Chang laughed extraordinarily happily after hearing about the situation. Ayo looked at Lu Chang and couldn't help but feel a bit helpless. Why can't I smile with such a pure heart? Lu Chang Chang explained that his son's martial arts would be accomplished, but Yu Yao was concerned that in the future, Luu would suffer setbacks and potentially harm himself.

Lu Chang Chang was unimpressed, stating that even great and strong men encounter trials and tribulations on the path to greatness. He was more than happy that Luu had such ambition and persistence. Yu Yao finally reacted when she heard these words. If Luu was not the marshal sage's only son, she believed he would know his mistakes and correct them properly, or his life would be in danger. Fortunately, Luu was the only son of the marshal sage, and Lu Chang Chang stood behind him.

Yu Yao asked Lu Chang Chang why she should discipline Luu if he had such a pure heart. Lu Chang Chang smiled and shook his head, saying that she should lecture him to see if his will and thoughts were firm. Yu Yao stared at her with tears in her eyes, feeling some heartache because she had already beaten Luu, although not with much force. If she had known that Lu Chang Chang had this attitude, she would have been lighter on her hands.

Yu Yao glared at Lu Chanun, saying that this matter was urgent and she hadn't thought it through. It was her fault. Lu Chang Chang apologized, and Yu Yao didn't pursue the matter further. She thought for a moment and said, "Just let him toss it around. He is, after all, my Lu Chaning son, a child king. Can't he still be one?"

Lu Chaning didn't care, saying that this was not as simple as a child king. By Yu Yao's side, no one could understand the gravity of the situation. The nature of this matter was very serious, and countless shocking secrets came to light. Even if it was stabbed out by a group of small children, it was still laid out in the open.

Yu Yao's words were right. There were some things not on the scale. There were no three Tales, but if on the scale of 1,000s, it could not be beaten. Lu Changing said that it was fine, and that was fine. No matter where it was, whether it was a religious institution or not, the commander-in-chief of the group army or not, as long as Lu Changing was given an explanation, this matter could be resolved. If an explanation was not given, don't blame him.

Lu Chang Chang continued to be more serious. As for this explanation, how exactly would it be considered a good explanation? That was up to Lu Chang Shan. It was foreseeable that the entire Grand Army and even the entire human community would have to stir up a bloody storm next. Countless benefits would be cut, and the source of all this came from a group of kid brothers partying from the old only son of the sage of Wu to change the sky and clarify the Jade.

The first reaction of the onlookers after hearing the news was, "Marshall Saints only son, how old is he?" It was quickly answered, "Marshall Saints only son, just 3 years old this year, still an imaginary age." But anyone who knew the cause and effect was dumbstruck, with jaws dropped one by one. It was almost hard to believe that this was the case. The false age of 3 years old was actually the actual age of 1 year and 8 months. In general, this age of the child could not even speak well, let alone control his feces or urine.

Yu Yao and Lu Chang Chang made such a big commotion compared to him, the rest of the world at their age really lived to be dogs. Of course, there were those who said it's not that simple. A child who was only a year and 8 months old, no matter how smart, could not have said those words, much less pulled off something that big. This matter may have been self-induced by the Marshall Saint and his son was just an innocent bystander.

Many people concurred with the notion of placing these matters on the table, while others vehemently opposed it. Those who disagreed felt that if the Marshall Saint genuinely intended to effect change, he would not have engaged in such convoluted maneuvers. After all, as a 10th realm Marshall Saint, he should not be involved in such trivialities.

At this point, Luu had become immensely famous, albeit within the upper echelons of Dashia. Those of a slightly lower status were simply unaware of these matters and had no access to them. Meanwhile, there was a flurry of activity on the outside. However, Luu did not dwell on it. Instead, he was eager to follow his group of children and brothers, specifically a group known as the Great Summer Heroes.

As soon as the group was formed, it became a buzzing hub. One by one, the sons of powerful nobles, the sons of Marshall Kings, and Marshall Emperors seamlessly transformed into a group of friends. Messages kept pouring in, and in the blink of an eye, the group reached 999+ members. Luu was stunned by the group's popularity and the number of people who liked to repeat and copy information.

According to tradition, Lu Chongxong, who was still free at home, should have taken Luu to pay a New Year's visit to their family. Despite Lu Chong's honorable status, he was still a member of the Lou family, and there were quite a few elders who were still alive. However, due to Luu's actions, Lu Chong had to run around to make amends, which delayed their visit.

The face of a Marshall Saint was indeed significant, and even a Marshall Emperor had to give an explanation for the mess that was created. However, when it came to Lu Changxang, it was someone else who had to give him an explanation. It was normal for a small thing like paying a New Year's visit to be slightly delayed.

Two days ago, at the Heroes Conference organized by Luu, hundreds of Heroes and heroines attended, including some descendants of the Lou family. Each and every one of those kids had their asses blown all over the place and were still in bed. However, their leading brother, Luu, said that it was precisely because of having gone through trials and tribulations that they could achieve better results.

The slightly older ones, aged 11 or 12, or even 13 or 14, escaped on that account because they didn't attend the convention. They were all gloating and disdainful of what these furry children had gotten up to. However, very soon, these young teenagers and young girls who thought highly of themselves were complained by their parents about why they didn't enter that Heroes assembly of Luu.

When these teenage girls heard this, they were dumbfounded. They did not give a damn about engaging in such a banquet and did not even want to participate in it. However, after the fact, it proved that their choice was right. Now, their parents were actually complaining about them and why they didn't join in. It's not good that they didn't join in, but they made such a big deal, got all beat up, and now they're back to complaining that they didn't join in.

Parents can see through some regret but it is not good to say anything more. This time, let their children contact words it will seem too deliberate and appear to be too mercenary. In turn, it is the next best thing. At the Marshall Saint's residence, Luu looked up at Lu Changxang and asked, "Why don't we go pay our respects?" It's not because of the mess you made two days ago.

It's a pain, troublesome, but not so much for your old man. It just takes some time. What have you done with this matter? It's not about how I would handle it, but how those people should handle it. They need to do everything they can to give me an explanation. So, when are we going to pay our respects? You want to go pay your respects? Why? Because you haven't been outside yet.

This was the truth. The Marshall Saint residence was enormous, like a scaled-down version of the city. It had everything inside, and there was usually no need to go outside. So, up until now, Lu You hadn't even left the door yet.

"Is it bad at home, Lu Chang Chang?" Lu Chang Chang rubbed his head. "Home is great, but I want to get out there too," Lu You said.

"Where do you want to go, Lu Chang Xang asked with a smile.

"I want to go to my teacher's house and pay my respects to my teacher," Lu You replied.

Lu thought about it and casually found a reason as an excuse. Lu Chang Xang frowned and pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, "It is possible to let your mom take you over there. Dad can't go."

"Why did you let me go?" Lu Chang Xang asked retorically. "If Dad doesn't go, what if I run into danger out there?"

"Don't you realize how much of a mess you've made?" Lu You said, changing the subject. Lu Chong Chang cried and laughed. "I've heard my mom talk about it some, and I probably know how serious this is."

Lu nodded. "Do you regret it?" Lu Chong Chang asked, a little curious.

"No regrets," Lu You replied decisively.

Lu Chong Chang was a little curious. There were times when he wondered what was going on in Lu You's little head. Lu You thought for a moment and then replied, "When I was listening to my teacher's lecture before, I said this sentence: 'A great man does something and does not do anything.' Lu Chang Xang looked at Lu You, saying this in a serious manner, and only felt a little amused. Then he continued to ask retorically, "Then do you know that for you this is not to be done?"

Lu You continued, "My teacher also said a sentence: 'Knowing that it is not possible to do but to do is the nature of a great man.' When Lu Chang Xang heard this, he was stunned. Then he touched Lu You's head and said with emotion, "You are right. These truths are simple to say but to really do it is another matter. You can do the unity of knowledge and action. It means that your teacher taught you very well."

We should indeed find a time to go and see your teacher and tell you what you need to know. Wait a little longer, and we can go out as soon as Dad finishes with the matter at hand," Lu Chang Xang said. When Lu You heard this, his eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but cheer, "Yeah, finally I can go out!"

Not long after, Aayu Yo also knew about this. She couldn't help but say to Lu Chang Xang, "You're really spoiling him, even taking him out at this juncture!"

Lu Chang Xang shook his head and said, "Mr. Lee has taught us well. We should indeed take some time and pay a visit."

Chapter 16: Geniuses and Demons, Like the Overflowing River

The fourth day of the year. Lu You lay on his back by the window of the S-Class spaceship and looked out at the scenery. Even if a marshall Emperor came over for a moment, it would be difficult to break the airship's defense. This was the current seat of the grand SE Marshall Saint, the Polaris S-Class spaceship. At the moment, the spacecraft had switched to an interplanetary flight mode, flying steadily at a very slow speed of 2,000 km per hour.

Inside the spaceship, Lu You was walking on the ground, not even a hint of shaking, much less the slightest discomfort. This spaceship was amazing, and Lu Chang Xang was quite pleased with himself.

"Dad, can I have this spaceship?" Lu You asked without looking back.

"Lu Chong Xang, how dare you! Do you know the price of this S-Class ship? An average Marshall King couldn't afford it, even if he dumped his family's money into it. Even a marshall Emperor would have to feel a pain in the flesh for a long time. And this one of his Polaris S-Class spaceships was specially built with a price tag that far exceeded that of ordinary S-Class spaceships. And now, Lu You even opened his mouth and wanted to come over. Really not polite at all. But there's no way, who made him his son!" Lu Chang Xang thought for a moment and said, "If you can break through to the sixth realm patriarch before you turn 18, I'll give you this spaceship as a bar mitzvah."

Lu You couldn't help but open his mouth when he heard this. The system panel had said that according to normal circumstances, when he reached the age of 18, he would still be at the peak of the second realm.

At age 40, he would break through to the fourth Realm of martial arts and stop there. Surprisingly, Lu Changxang allowed him to break through the sixth Realm at only 18. This request seemed overwhelming, as Luu's expression showed. Lu Chang Ching smiled and asked if he found it difficult. Luu nodded, mentioning that at 18, breaking through the fourth Realm could grant admission to Blue Star University, one of the top institutions in the human community. With nearly a thousand planets and over 3 trillion people, getting into Blue Star University was incredibly rare.

To break through the fourth Realm before 18 was a feat only accomplished by exceptional geniuses, whether in natural talent, family background, or acquired efforts. Now, Lu Changxang wanted him to achieve the sixth Realm before 18, becoming a Grandmaster. At this level, one could almost serve as a teacher at Blue Star University. Luu's teacher, a former Blue Star professor, was only at the Grandmaster level.

Lu Chang Ching reminded Luu that last year, inside Luu's home, Marshall Emperors and Kings were common, while Grandmasters were inferior to dogs. However, outside this environment, even a Grandmaster would be a significant figure. Breaking through to the sixth Realm Patriarch was no easy task.

Luu realized he shouldn't assume he was invincible and could easily break through to the sixth Realm Sovereign before 18. Lu Chang Chong observed Luu's changing expressions and laughed, revealing that Luu's father had achieved the sixth Realm at 16. Luu was shocked and understood why the system panel mentioned his current situation.

Lu Changxang explained that he had already broken through the sixth Realm at 16, making him a remarkable genius. As Luu's father, he had recognized Luu wasn't a martial arts prodigy and stopped investing resources, hoping Luu would give up martial arts for a peaceful life. However, Luu refused this arrangement.

Luu marveled at Lu Chang Chong, considering him a typical protagonist. Lu Chang Chong felt satisfied and told Luu he only needed to break through the sixth Realm before 18. After some thought, Luu agreed. Lu Chang Chong then shared that he didn't attend college at 16 or 17 but at 10, surprising Luu.

Luu couldn't help but think about the extraordinary geniuses in this world, including his father. The population base was larger, making it more common for supreme geniuses to appear. Lu Changxang mentioned that there were even more geniuses than him, some with special physiques, supernatural abilities, and breaking through the fourth Realm at a very young age.

As Luu listened, he realized that this world was filled with exceptional individuals, making him feel less demonic in comparison. In this world outside the sky and people, Luu wouldn't have to worry about being too extraordinary. The abundance of geniuses and demons created a dynamic environment where talent thrived.

Afterward, Lou couldn't help but ask, "So, these geniuses, were they either assassinated, fell halfway through the process, or became some great Masters or Marshall Kings? I guess Lu Chang Xang said lightly, "Chapter 17: Pillars of the Human Race. Such a genius only achieves Grandmaster or Marshall King in the end." Luu blinked, feeling a bit incredulous. This was a bit different from his expectations.
"What do you mean by only achieving Grandmaster and Marshall King?" Lu Chang Xang glanced at him, showing a little bit of tiny talent at the beginning. In the realm of the Earth stage of martial arts, soaring forward, causing others to exclaim that they are absolute demons. Surely, they are the next martial Saints. This kind of person simply doesn't have too many of them. After all, there are so many people in the human race, and there are simply too many so-called Supreme demons and once-in-a-century Geniuses. A bunch of people like that have to show up every year. Universities treat them like babies and take them all under their wing. But in the end, only one in a million actually grows up. Never underestimate a Marshall King. Any Marshall King is a true genius."
Killed from a bunch of geniuses, not that kind of pseudo genius. Luu's eyes were once again refreshed as he listened to these words. He raised his head again and looked at his own old man. Then, what does a Marshall Saint like you, old man, count as?
When Li Chang Xang heard this, he smiled and shook his head. "I've just been slightly lucky."
Luu was speechless for a while when he heard this. A little bit of luck. The hell with it. The so-called luck is only the humble word of the strong. Other people would be fooled and crippled if they really believed it. After all, the only one Marshall Saint in this star, Marshall Calendar's 2,000 years of time long, is just as Father and Son were chatting. The home of their teacher, Liwang Thai, finally arrived as a great Master's residence. The house here was still very large and it was quite spectacular when viewed from above. Only that it was a bit shabby when compared to the Marshall Saints residence. The contrast is like the difference between a palace and a courtyard. But the quadrangle was certainly nice. However, compared to the Palace, there was naturally no way to compare.
Teacher, like Wangai, had long since received the news that the Marshall Saint had brought his own son to visit. So, he deliberately brought a lot of people over to meet them, which could be considered a great deal of excitement. Have to say, a Marshall Saint personally coming over to pay his respects. How dignified must such a thing be? When told, however, Lu Chang Xang hadn't come over to pay his respects before. So, strictly speaking, it wasn't his face. But Lu U I heard that he was the one who suggested that he wanted to come over to see his teacher and pay his respects.
Li Wangai smiled from ear to ear, not to mention how happy he was, saying, "Three good in a row." Then, Li Wangai put a thick red packet stuffed in Luu's small pocket. This is the pressure money. Luu could clearly feel the heavy weight of this Red Envelope. The teacher is really generous.
That said, to the old man, Lu Ching's character should not be so dry to confiscate the operation of the New Year's Eve money. But the mother, by Yuyo, is not necessarily women always think too much. Consider too much. If we really confiscate his yearbook money, we won't have any funds for activities afterward. Ah, how can we still have the heroes convention? Such thoughts flashed through Luu's mind.
Next, the teacher gave Luu and LU Chang Xang a brief introduction to his family. "Nice guy." Not to mention grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The teacher actually even had great great grandchildren. That's called a crowd pleaser. At the moment, there were hundreds of immediate family members who came this way alone. And everyone wanted to see the Marshall Saint. If you count the ones who didn't show up, there were definitely thousands of them. This is actually normal for many of the older Patriarchs. A sixth realm patriarch could live for 180 years. While a seventh realm Grand patriarch could live for at least 300 years. Although in his later years, his CH and blood declined, and he was in much worse shape than before, his life expectancy did not diminish. And a great master who had accumulated wealth for so many years was absolutely terrifying. Feeding a large family can be a breeze. Many martial arts families that's how they came to be. Including the Lou Family. Actually, if Luu's Dad wasn't a Marshall Saint, just a Grandmaster or a Marshall King, then he would be living in the Lou family's original home. The teacher, Li Wangai, married three wives. Not polygamous. Rather, he is a great master and can live for 300 years. But his wife cannot. The years went by. Time went by. The original wife died, even their son died. But he was still alive. What a lonely thing that is. In those lonely times, Li Wangai meets a woman who looks very similar to his original wife. A Love Affair was formed between the two, and a great family was born. Hearing this, Lou couldn't help but think, "Mom, by Yuyo, is a great master and can only live for 180 years. But she is still alive and well. She is still young and beautiful. She is still full of energy and vitality. She is still full of love and warmth. She is still full of hope and dreams. She is still full of life and passion. She is still full of happiness and joy. She is still full of wisdom and knowledge. She is still full of courage and determination. She is still full of kindness and compassion. She is still full of grace and elegance. She is still full of strength and resilience. She is still full of creativity and imagination. She is still full of ambition and aspiration. She is still full of curiosity and wonder. She is still full of enthusiasm and excitement. She is still full of optimism and positivity. She is still full of gratitude and appreciation. She is still full of generosity and magnanimity. She is still full of humility and modesty. She is still full of patience and perseverance. She is still full of wisdom and insight. She is still full of love and care. She is still full of hope and faith. She is still full of courage and confidence. She is still full of ambition and aspiration. She is still full of curiosity and wonder. She is still full of enthusiasm and excitement. She is still full of optimism and positivity.

She is still full of wisdom and insight. She is still full of love and care. She is still full of hope and faith. She is still full of courage and confidence. She is still full of ambition and aspiration. She is still full of curiosity and wonder. She is still full of enthusiasm and excitement. She is still full of optimism and positivity.

Dad is a martial arts Saint, and he can live for at least a thousand years, right? Maybe, if in the future you have to endure such loneliness, you'll find that one similar flower. No, at a realm like Marshall Saint, one should be able to find some life-extending treasures that would allow one to live longer, but probably not survive together forever. At this moment, Lu Changxian was surrounded by a circle of people. Although his teacher, Guang Tha, reprimanded him, he couldn't resist their enthusiasm. They all wanted to find Lu Changxian to get an autograph. The scene was like the most ardent fan finally meeting his idol, even more exaggerated because idols were simply not enough to compare to Marshall Saint Lu Changxian.

In the entire Grand Alliance, Lu Ching's popularity was second only to none. Facing these people, Lu Changxian didn't show any impatience; instead, he was very cordial and gave autographs to all of them. After all, he had become so strong to protect these ordinary people. Seeing this scene, Luu suddenly asked his teacher, "How long can a Marshall Saint live?"

Upon hearing this question, Guang Tha froze and then slowly said, "I'm afraid only the Marshall Saint himself knows. However, at a conservative estimate, he can live for about 2,000 years at the very least." Luu couldn't help but be a little surprised by this reply. So long! Guang Tha couldn't help but glance at his filial son and said with a smile, "It's a blessing for all humanity to have such a Marshall Saint in Daa. No, the entire human community, you're still young, and I'm afraid you're not too clear about it. Back when your father rose to power, the great s and even the entire human race didn't have the peace and quiet they have now. Now, it has become relatively more peaceful, and backwaters like Blue Star have not been at war for many years. This is all thanks to the Marshall Saint. He is the pillar of the entire human race."

While Luu was talking to his teacher, Li Guang Thai, not everyone's eyes were on Lu Changxian. Some people looked at Luu curiously. A few days ago, after the old master returned, he said more than once that he had never seen such an intelligent child as Luu, truly worthy of being the son of a Marshall Saint. So, they were a little curious about how smart this Marshall Saint's only son really was. Seeing it now, one couldn't help but look at each other: is this really a three-year-old or is it an imaginary age talking so clearly, thinking so fast, and being able to express his thoughts accurately? Even if they said seven or eight years old, there would be people who would believe them. It's pretty extraordinary.

These people didn't know that on New Year's Eve, Luu had stirred up such a big commotion, almost breaking the sky. At the moment, they were just focusing on his surprised mannerisms. In that case, even Li Guang had only smelled something out of place and didn't know the whole story. The rest of them would have no way of knowing.

Luu and Lu Changxian were welcomed to their home and received a warm reception from their teacher. Luu didn't treat himself as a guest and, after eating and drinking, followed a group of children around. Once again, he played up his social bull nature, becoming the child king of the group and making them recognize him as the leader of the pack. Although Luu's identity is outstanding, the only son of the martial arts Saint, this group of children also wanted to save face. The moment you come up to recognize him as a big brother, naturally, it is impossible. Luu then told them a story, a story of a genius.

As we all know, the entrance standard for Blue Star University is to break through to the Martial Fourth Realm before the age of 18. At this age, someone with such martial arts cultivation was undoubtedly a genius among geniuses. These words caused the crowd to agree. An elder Li also said, "No problem." The next thing Luu said caused a sensation in this group. For example, what terrifying demon at the age of five or six could arrive at the fourth realm? But this was nothing at all; it was not a true genius at all. Every year, this kind of demon could be said to be endless. There were simply not too many of these so-called demons in a human community with a population of several trillions. Most of them had fallen, and even if they hadn't died, in the end, they were only a Marshall King. For many years, there was only one 10 realms Marshall Saint, that's the gold of Lu Changxian. As for him, Luu, his old Marshall Saint father had high hopes that he would break through to the Sixth Realm of the Marshal before he turned 18, becoming a patriarch in the future. He was also going to arrive at the Marshall Saint Realm, even breaking through to above Marshall Saint blue, which is better than blue, and that's what he needs to do. These grandiose words led these brats into a daydream, and each of them looked

Meanwhile, not far away, Lu Chong was speechless for a moment when he heard these words. These words, this content, were exactly what he himself had said to Luu on the spaceship, in an attempt to curb Luu's arrogance and impatience, and to open his eyes, letting him know that there is a sky beyond the sky and people beyond people. Even if a short time brought some small achievements, it was nothing. The path of a martial artist was still long. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, Luu would use these words as a talking point and begin to snub his teacher. "That little bugger, he's quite a talent," Lu Chong thought. These words, this story about a genius, undoubtedly conquered the group of children, making them willing to recognize Luu as their leading brother.

After this, Luu took out the New Year's money he had just obtained and bought quite a few snacks and drinks for the large group of children in style, then started the party. Luu sat on the upper seat and accepted the bragging from the crowd. It was a good-sized party with an even wider variety of snacks. Some of the slightly older children, who were too old to fit in, looked enviously at the banquet. There was no singing or dancing, just enjoying themselves. There was no situation like the last one where all kinds of secrets were shaken out. After all, they were only the descendants of their teacher, Li Guang Tai, and didn't know that many secrets yet. Luu had learned his lesson from the last time, so the discussion at this banquet was not about the institutional corruption of Diaa and the human community as a whole, but about the foreign races and the war situation of the evil God races, making it relatively safe.

There were some people who had actually heard something about this. An eight-year-old child named Liu spoke up, "I've been watching the news for the past few days, and there's news about the loss of the battlefield in the Timma Starfield. That extraterrestrial evil God, the Star Swallowing God, and all the evil God familiars under his command launched a general attack on the human Legion stationed in the Timma Starfield. Because it was too sudden, the situation over there is very bad."

When these words came out, the crowd burst into chatter. "I've heard about it too. Before this, the Star Swallowing God, who has always maintained a neutral attitude with humans, I don't know what happened and suddenly turned against them. These extraterrestrial evil Gods, none of them can be trusted. It's a normal situation for them to turn against us." "Also, I've recently heard that the northern border battlefield over in the Great Dog Starfield is also waging war."

The people were talking, each saying their news, while Luu listened carefully. Prior to that, he had very little exposure to this aspect of the news. Of course, it is more or less comical to have a bunch of hairless children discussing war matters here, however, Luu didn't see anything wrong with it. Who says kids can't discuss world affairs? Not to mention a bunch of kids from the Star Wars era, it's normal to be a little precocious. The credibility of this information though remains to be tested, but it doesn't stop people from blowing their minds.

This time, Luu glanced at the panel's quest progress. Sure enough, it shows 3050 mission progress bar added seven points. Next, he only needed to obtain the approval of 20 more future companions, and he would be able to obtain the top-grade Heaven and Earth Wonder. There's less than a month to go, and I don't know if I'll be able to finish the Absolute Great Heaven and Earth Wonder," Luu thought. He didn't dare to count on it, but this Upper Great Heaven and Earth Wonder, he could still make an effort. Having obtained such a good treasure as the Pixil Luck Suppressing Stone, how powerful could a top-grade be? It's really something to look forward to.

After a discussion of military matters, the guys eventually came to a conclusion: that's the general situation for humanity at the moment, and it's not too good. Despite what the teacher had said before, Pops Luu Chang Shang had risen to power, humanity had been far from peaceful, and nows had become relatively peaceful. This peace, however, is only relative, not that one can really rest on one's laurels. After all, the human race only had one Martial Saint. The expansion of the human community to its current level can be said to be surrounded by enemies and can only be passively defended.

Luu dried a mouthful of juice and said with great pride, "When I grow up, I'll make them attack and defend." Just then, the system mission triggered again: "You managed to gain the recognition of some of your childhood companions, becoming their leading elder brother. Barely for the son of the Martial Saint restored some fame, but this is far from enough. The next you need to continue to grow your reputation so that more people see you, so that everyone knows once the son of the Martial Saint is back. Please gain 1 billion reputation points. Mission reward: Dragon Tiger Golden Elixir."

"We haven't even finished the last mission yet, and we actually have another one," Luu looked at the words in the light screen in front of him. He had always thought that this quest was just a single-line quest, but he didn't realize that there was actually another one. However, this...

Here is the improved English text:

Mission seems a bit of a stretch, but the rewards for the quests are equally generous. Dragon Tiger golden pill – the name alone tells you it's unusual. Chapter 19: I want to control the world's troops and horses. A group of children hosted a banquet enthusiastically discussing Foreign Wars and Military Affairs. Li Changchang had a headache just from looking at it. He could finally be sure that the other day when he stirred up such a big basket, it was really his own son's handiwork. Can't really blame anyone on the side. Li Wai thought this was interesting; he saw nothing wrong with it. At a young age, worried about the country and the people – there's such a sense of urgency. No wonder I've been practicing martial arts; what's wrong with it? Li Wai felt that Luu had really listened to what he usually taught him and was quite pleased at the moment. Lu Changchang glanced at Le Guantai and seeing this expression on his face, he couldn't help but say, "Teacher, ah, you don't know what a big deal This Little Child made a few days ago. Oh, what else can he make a mess of?" Li Guangtha heard this and was not very convinced. Lu Changchang then briefly talked about what happened a few days ago. Li Guangtha was directly silenced by the dry after hearing this. The gazes that looked at Luu again all changed a bit. No wonder you're so skillful at opening banquets – at the moment, so you've had experience? A basket case that big is scary to think about. Let's just say it's a bit overwhelming." Li Guangtha said with emotion. "I remember when you were young, the things you made a mess of were not small at all, right?" Lu Changchang nodded slightly. "After all, being a Marshall, Emperor are from the mountain of blood, see, kill, offend people – not a common occurrence. Not to mention a Marshall Saint – so Lu Chan Chang was quite calm about Luu's mess. He wasn't afraid of Luu causing trouble – he was afraid that he didn't even have the ability to cause trouble. How could his son Lu Chong Xong be that kind of incompetent?" After going to his teacher's house, Luu realized that the situation of the human community today was not optimistic. On this side of the blue star, it was still safe, but if he left the blue star with Luu's status as the Marshall Saints' only son, he was afraid that he would be attacked in minutes – sure, even if it was an attack, most likely it wouldn't be life-threatening. After all, those foreign races wouldn't dare to bear the wrath of a Marshall Saint. But using it to accomplish something – is still a sure thing. Although, as a three-year-old child, it was still a bit too early to start worrying about the country, now. But he was, after all, the only son of the Marshall Saint, so there was no excuse for him to think about it more. In the future, he would eventually have to grow up, and Luou you found a very serious problem. According to the system panel, he was infected with an alien virus at the age of one and fell sick at the age of three. He detected that his root bones were strangely poor, and only at the age of 12 did he break through the second realm of the wow. And after that, he was even more so – at the age of 28 – before the Third Realm of the wow. And only at the age of 40 – before the fourth Realm of the wow. Logically speaking, as the only son of a Marshall Saint, and with his mother being a Grandmaster, his qualifications could never be so poor. In here, there might be the shadows of those foreign races, and even those evil gods – that big illness a few months ago may have been their tactic. Even more so, after that – it wasn't that Luu thought too much. This thing is indeed strange – it's worth scrutinizing. There might even be something wrong with it. Thinking of this, Luu subconsciously looked at Lu Chang Xong, wanting to talk to his old man about his speculation, but on second thought, he thought that there was no reason for Lu Chang Xong to be unaware of a problem that even he had thought of. Maybe he should start checking it out when he's sick himself – it's too late to react to the fact that something is wrong. That night, after Luu returned home, he sat on the crib, holding onto the railing, and thought seriously about the future of this Dashan and even the entire human community beyond that. What is the fastest way to gather those companions' approval, and how to get a billion reputation points? What a headache he had – some vague thoughts. Lu Ya Luu pondering and Sced in Surprise. "What are you thinking about?" "I'm thinking about big things." Luu said. Lu Ya froze. "Yeah, I realized that the Grandmaster and even the entire human race is not considered safe." Luu's delicate little face was serious. The current Dasha, as well as the human Community, is full of ills. There are very big problems. "What are you going to do then?" Lu Ya asked with a smile. "I'm too young, only 3 years old – I have no strength, and no say. It's hard to do anything. I can only think about how to do it in the future." Luu said. Then, he thought for a moment, and continued. "But I am the son of a Marshall Saint. Although others can underestimate me, they cannot underestimate my father. So I can use my dad's voice to have some say."

"What about after having acquired the power of speech, Bayyo looked at Luu with a surprised expression. He was so small, but he actually knew how to utilize the power, despite its limitations. With the power of speech, you can attempt to solve some problems, such as those raised at our family banquet earlier, Luu said seriously. That won't do; it's not something the current generation can handle. By Yuya's face changed at that moment; it wouldn't be fun if this aspect was involved," Byu Ya added, emphasizing the point.

"That's not something the current generation can touch," Luu said seriously. "Even with the help of my father's reputation as a grand marshal, Saint, no one else will care about me one of these days. I'm going to... I want to control the world's armies." Yuya looked surprised. He could feel it.

"But Lu, you're not even a proper Ed," Byu Ya said, eyeing him warily. "Even with the help of my father's reputation as a martial artist and, as you said, a strong man, but Lu Chang Xang, the martial Saint, was like the Emperor of an ancient Dynasty, seemingly supreme and exclusive, but in reality... the operation of society was not as simple as that. The court was just a couple of palaces and a couple of officials; the meal was still served in separate pots. The distribution of the many benefits was subject to constant gaming; no one was naturally deserving of a larger share, nor a smaller share. It was just a matter of who you were, whether you were the emperor or the son of Heaven, you wanted to be all things to all people. It was a kid's idea, something not even possible in reality."

"Power, by its very nature, is never top down, but bottom up," Byu Ya explained. "It's just an analogy, Lu Chang Xang was not an emperor, and the world was not an ancient Dynasty either. The real situation was so much more complicated. Yuya sighed, looking at Luu with a mixture of frustration and sadness. Luu had discovered that Byu Ya wasn't interested in his plans to control the world's armies."

"He was good at everything, just a little too simple," Yuya lamented. "And whenever things got complicated, she would rely on others to handle it, while Luu was already lost. He had discovered that Byu Ya wasn't really interested in these things; she was only good at things that needed to be done, simply because that's what she was good at. Luu looked at Byu Za with a mixture of sadness and disappointment."

"Why is that, Lu?" Byu Ya asked, looking at him with a curious expression. "You can't rely on me anymore. Does that mean I'm not the right person for you to talk to, little boy?" Yuya's eyes flashed with annoyance.

"No, byu Ya was wrong. I didn't say that," Luu said quickly, standing up and facing Yuya. "Byu Ya looked at him with surprise and curiosity. 'What did you say that was?'"

"You don't want to go into politics, kid; that's not something you can do," By Wu Ya said coldly. "Even if you do become a grand marshal, like your father, people will just take your words as a joke. Your age is just too young, let alone your status as the son of a martial Saint. So, what's the point of even talking to you?" Byu Ya glared at Luu, who looked at her with a mixture of hurt and frustration.

"I... I just said that...," Luu hesitated, "that I want to control the world's armies. And become like my father... a grand marshal."

"But you're not even a proper Ed," Byu Ya said firmly. "I can feel it. You have to focus on one thing, Luu. You have to become stronger. That's the number one priority. Don't waste time on things that don't matter, like your mother's shallow understanding. Focus on martial arts and becoming stronger. That's the key." Byu Ya looked at Luu with a hint of disappointment. Luu looked at Byu Ya with a mixture of anger and hurt.

"What's wrong with you, mom?" Luu muttered, feeling frustrated. "You're always so... shallow... You never really read my mind. And neither did Dad, for that matter. He just married you because... he made a mistake. That's not right. As the wife of a grand marshal, you need to understand the bigger picture, the complexities... the nuances. You can't just be shallow like that."

"I see," Byu Ya said seriously, looking at Luu with a newfound understanding. "Tell me where you went wrong, Luu."

Yuya's eyes narrowed. "How did that happen, byu Ya?" she asked, her tone a reminder that there was a reason she didn't like Luu. "What made you so small?"

Luu hesitated, "Okay... I spent all that time relying on you too much, and I started to think I wasn't strong enough without your help. And I didn't listen to your words, no matter how careful you were."

Yuya glared at Luu, a cloud of impatience hanging in the air. "That's where you went wrong," she said with determination, her expression calm but her voice trembling slightly. "And that's why I'm going to have to leave Luu alone as well. Because being true to oneself is not something I'll understand in you."

Lou hurriedly said, "I know Luu said in a hurry, 'Whom by Yuyo, let out a nasal sound. 'Mom, you are a great Master,' he exclaimed, 'How could you not know all this?' Just don't take it seriously with me as a little kid. I'm just fooling around.' Lou, however, had become carried away and actually thought it was Yuyo who was too simple. Yu ya nodded, then seriously educated him, "It's good that you have an idea, but you definitely can't put your mind on it. But I have not yet reached the age of three. I cannot yet practice martial arts. It is not ideal, as generally after reaching the age of three, the root bones are tested, and then martial arts training can begin. So before that, Luu couldn't practice martial arts even if he wanted to, as it would seriously affect the body's development in growth. The average child at this age is still playing with mud and does not have this trouble.

Luu, however, wants to go into politics. Yuyo is powerless to spit, "You're so young, and besides, being in politics isn't fun." Bay Yuyo said in a serious tone, "I'm not doing this for fun but for the human community. Luu was full of passion and righteousness. Bay Yuyo immediately felt a headache. She realized that this son of hers over the past few months seemed to be progressing just too fast. You haven't learned to walk yet, and you're thinking about flying, but the thing is, fighting doesn't work either. The hand is light. Lou you does not matter at all. The real hand is dead beat work. She cannot give up after thinking about it. Bayu Yao glanced at Luu, "It's not for me to decide. You have to ask your father about such important matters. He's the head of the family."

Lou you wanted to say, "I know you can't decide, but after thinking about it, he still didn't say it and instead said, "I just want you to support me, Mom." By Yuyo was a little torn. Logically speaking, one should never agree to such a ridiculous thing, but Luu was so insistent that one couldn't extinguish his unrelenting momentum. Could one? By Yuyo thought for a second, "It's good to let Luu see it, let him know ahead of time that the world doesn't work as simply as he thinks it does, as long as you don't fool around and are obedient, I can take you to see the world." By Yu ya finally went soft, "Yeah, Luu."

Luu couldn't help but cheer out then hugged By Yu Yao, "Mommy's the best!" By Yuyo, to be honest, the moment she said yes to him, she regretted it a little. It seemed like it shouldn't be so hasty, but then again, really letting a three-year-old in politics, how is that possible? Just taking him to see the world and know how the country is run, that's all. In fact, Luu didn't really want to go into politics. He was just taking this opportunity to build up his reputation value and see if he could complete the system Quest, a billion reputation points is too hard though, but for the sake of that one Dragon Tiger golden pill, one had to try anything.

After Bayu Ya told Lu Chang xang about this matter, Lu Chang xang was surprised. He remembered that before, in the teacher house, this little guy pulled up a large group of people and organized a banquet. It was called a waving in pointing. It seemed perfectly normal for him to have these thoughts. However, Li Chang xang felt that there was nothing wrong. He was already occupying great power, and although he was usually just decentralized, it didn't mean that just because he spoke, it didn't matter. By Yuyo, this Marshall Saint lady, was likewise the same. There is nothing wrong with letting By Yuyo take Luu attend National meetings go on TV and see the world. After all, he is my Lu Chang shing's son. Originally, Lu Chang Shang hadn't had this idea. Now that I think about it, it's not a bad idea. With that, the matter was decided in a flash that night.

The Heroes of Dashia chat group suddenly someone spoke, "You guys go watch TV." Someone quickly replied, "Another new cartoon? No, you'll just have to go and see the news station live." Those words instantly aroused the curiosity of many people. What's wrong, watching the news? Did something big happen? Does it say these people thought about the other day they attended the banquet and stabbed out a big basket for a moment some Panic, if things get more serious, they might even get a beating. One by one, they turned on their TVs and turned to National television and then they saw this scene: their leading brother Lu, who had just turned three this year, was sitting in the main seat of the conference Hall waving toward the camera at this instant, everyone couldn't help but stare in disbelief. Chapter 21: There's no such thing as an idiot. Marshall artists are not Reckless. Marshall cultivation is a process of physical refining. One realm practices skin and flesh. The second realm forges the muscles and bones. Three Realms of refining the viscera. The four Realms change blood. The five Realms cast a golden body. The six Realms condense the Dharma. On the path of cultivation, almost every realm of advancement was a full sublimation of the physical body. As the physical body is in the process of sublimation, the spirit is also being quenched. Like the unforgettable talent that Luu had acquired for a sixth realm patriarch, it would be a basic ability, not to mention the grand Masters, Marshall Kings, and even martial Emperors in the back. It would be reckless to engage in combat at this stage.

It would be a grave error to consider martial artists as reckless; in reality, the opposite is often true. The more powerful a martial artist, the greater their mental acuity and breadth of knowledge. Consequently, those in charge of a nation's significant and minor affairs are typically powerful martial artists. This is understandable, given that there are 688 inhabited planets under the rule of Diaa, and the sheer volume of governmental affairs is astronomical, even with the aid of artificial intelligence. Without the physical strength and stamina of a martial artist, ordinary individuals would be unable to manage such responsibilities.

While martial artists may not be interested in political affairs once they reach a certain level of strength, this is because they are more concerned with pushing the boundaries of life from a practical standpoint. Transcending to the next realm can grant them several more years of life, making political affairs seem like a waste of time. Therefore, those in charge of Diaa's state affairs are usually sixth realm Patriarchs, with the stronger ones being seventh realm Grand Masters. Even a Marshall King realm Powerhouse is a rare find.

This creates a delicate situation, as even Grandmaster powerhouses who govern the state of Grandia are hesitant to offend martial Emperor powerhouses or their families. For instance, on New Year's Eve, Luu hosted a hero's convention at his home, revealing many secrets. These secrets are well-known among the top officials in charge of Dasha's political affairs, yet they are unable to act upon them. A Marshall Emperor realm Powerhouse has the ability to destroy a planet with a single strike, making them the core of the human war effort and the mainstay in the fight against the Fay and evil Gods.

Both the Granda and human communities rely on these top powerhouses to lead the fight against foreign races and evil Gods. These powerhouses are essential, and their privileges are naturally expected. The top echelons of Dasha have the ability to punish their families and charges, but the constraints are too great. Many policies, even those beneficial to the country and its people, are not well implemented due to the complex web of factions and interests involved.

This has led to a situation where many reformers believe that if they can gain the support of L Changxang, the country of Dasha will be revitalized. However, L Changxang has not shown any interest in supporting them, causing many to sigh with regret. Today, upon seeing that Lu Ching's son Luu has appeared in the high-level circles of Dasha, these people's eyes have lit up, and they have gathered around to get on good terms with him. In the face of such benefits, Bayuya has remained unfazed, rejecting all offers.

After these people leave, Bayuya looks at Luu and asks with a serious face, "Do you know why they are so humble? Because I am the child of a Marshall Saint, L." Luu ponders this question, unsure of the answer.

Ya nodded, but it doesn't stop there. They're the Reformation Faction, advocating for reforms in the Grand Duchy, which inevitably requires strong support. Unfortunately, behind them, there's only a single Marshal Emperor, so they can't even become a significant force because they lack support.

Lu, you asked. No, there are many people willing to invest in them, including many Martial Kings and even Martial Emperors, Yuyo said slowly. Then why don't they accept the support of those Martial Emperors and Martial Kings since they need support? You asked in a somewhat strange manner.

That's naturally because if they get the support of those Martial Emperors and Martial Kings, they will inevitably have to take responsibility for the forces behind them. In that case, the so-called Reformation Faction will become a complete and utter joke, Yu Yao patiently explained. That's why they decisively rejected the support of those Martial Kings and Martial Emperors.

Luu listened to this explanation and instantly understood the twists and turns. He nodded, saying, So that's how it is. They are quite bold. I had thought that they were just power-hungry villains wanting to flatter the Marshal Saint and hug his thighs. That's why they had that kind of face. I didn't expect them to have that kind of ambition.

Bayu Ya looked deeply at Luu and said seriously, You have to remember one thing. There isn't a single stupid person in the top echelons of the dignitaries of Diaa. Even if they did something stupid, there must be a deeper reason behind it.

Chapter 22: The Most Disabled Disciple, Luu nodded under Yu Ya's introduction. He was barely aware of how deep and treacherous the water was in this circle of the Dasha political scene. The major factions include the Unionists, Conservatives, the main war party, Local Pi, Renovationist, Marshall Sacred Sect, and so on. After all, there were too many great sea ruling planets, 688 of them. Every living planet has to involve countless interests as well as countless entanglements.

The political affairs of these affiliated planets were partly ruled autonomously and partly needed to be reported to the Blue Star so that the higher echelons of Dasha's political affairs would be responsible for handling them. This also led to the fact that the situation in the capital star, Blue Star, was complicated to the point of making one's head spin.

Yu Yao briefly introduced it, talking about close to 100 power factions, and the struggle between these factions is by no means a peaceful passing of the buck. The shiny surface can be characterized as dark and crisis-ridden. Listening to the presentation, Luu sort of understood why Bayyo opposed his participation in politics. The water is too deep for a little kid like him to get in.

It wasn't that Luu didn't have a bit of strength. Quite the opposite, as the only son of the Marshal Saint, Luu had rightfully become the Crown Prince of the Marshall Sacred Faction. With Lu Chang Xang at his back, as long as Luu was willing, his voice could be quite significant. Who dares to mess with him? In a more serious situation, regardless of any faction or power, they all have to give him a face. Not giving face to Luu was not giving face to Lu Chang Xang.

And that's exactly what happened. A very large number of well-meaning people had their eyes on him. They wanted to use Luu and the power of Lu Chang Xang to accomplish their goals. The renovationists before them could not have been a better example. As long as Luu was here, there would be no shortage of such things.

Seeing Luu's tiny face looking pensive, Yu Ya smiled and asked, What's wrong? Afraid not afraid? Luu raised his head and spoke, but you're right. The situation here is chaotic. So maybe without realizing it, we'll fall into someone else's trap and be sold by these supremely smart people and have to count the money for them. It's good that you know.

Yu Ya nodded, saying, Inside these people's hearts are so black. Even though what they do is for the sake of the country, I don't like it. In such a way, but they also have their difficulties and couldn't do anything if they weren't like this. And that in turn is why I'm reluctant to set foot on this side. While I do realize that power abhors a vacuum and that if I don't come over, naturally, some people are coming to take their place. I just don't like it.

Luu couldn't help but nod as he listened to these words. The one who's overthinking things is me. He was the one who thought of his mother as too innocent. Come to think of it, in the previous life, Earth was just a planet with so many countries, so many things to do, and so many Heroes and heroines. In this world, where the great sea ruled over 688 living planets, the many things were more than just a little bit more complicated.

Luu wanted to change the sky and Earth but also wanted to clarify the Jade. It is really not generally difficult. It's harder than going to heaven. A Grandmaster would be able to physically step into the universe with his current qualifications. It was no longer a problem for him to become a great Master. Just this way, is it true that the greatness that was blown down in the beginning can't be realized? No, not yet. The coming days are long. It is too early to conclude that it will not work. Thinking of this, Luou U's eyes brightened once again, and he was not discouraged by it. He opened and turned on the reverse system 40 years ahead of schedule. There are some things that need to be done.

In the current stage, the primary task was to obtain 1 billion reputation points. Pondering on how to achieve this, Luu considered his potential TV appearance, but feared it might not yield enough prestige without a remarkable performance. Yuyo had perceived the society's complexity and thought Luu should be cautious. However, Luu was astonished by Luu's unwavering determination.

Luu then located the person in charge of the Marshall Sacred Sect, a Marshall King realm cultivator named Shonza. Shonza was a disciple of Lu Chang Shing, one of the few disciples of the Marshall Saints. Despite his years of cultivation, he had only managed to break through the Marshall King realm, considered a waste in some aspects.

Luu, who had a similar background from his previous life, didn't dwell on this. He directly asked Shonza for help in showcasing himself and building his reputation. Shonza proposed that Luu could replace the Dasha Chief Executive Officer during a New Year's greeting session for the Dasha Nationals. This position held significant status, and Luu's request was granted.

Luu realized that the task was simpler than he had anticipated. As long as he performed well, he could easily earn a billion reputation points. This mission, considered an SSS-level high difficulty in later generations, would be challenging without the given opportunity. Luu was confident that he could garner considerable prestige if he performed brilliantly.

The Chief Executive Officer, Lou Hang Hong, also agreed to step aside when presented with the request from Shonza. Lou Hang Hong had been a member of the Marshall Sacred Sect before becoming the CEO, and their support had played a significant role in his current position.

Luu understood that his identity as the Crown Prince was still challenging, but the situation didn't seem as threatening and complicated as Yuyo had described. Listening to both sides of the story provided a clearer perspective, and Luu believed that Yuyo's statements were true but selective. Luu glanced at Yuyo, who felt a bit weak but then thought it might be due to her concern about Luu's potential indulgence in power. However, Luu's determination to clarify the truth and change the world should prevent him from succumbing to the temptation easily.

By Uyo's heart was pounding with anticipation, hoping that Luu wouldn't be interested in those just as By Yuyo was worrying about all this. Meanwhile, Luu was chatting with Shunza. Shunza looked at Luu with interest, having heard a lot about this son of his Master. A few days ago, there had been a huge mess and a big fuss was made. So young to be that rowdy, let's just say not bad for a teacher's son. Now that he had seen it with his own eyes and talked about it, he felt even more extraordinary. It was extraordinary to be so young in age but almost like an adult in both thinking and talking.
Originally, J Jonza was still a little worried that Luu didn't have the means to say a good New Year's toast. Now, that didn't seem like a big deal at all. They talked a little more, and the time had come for Luu to deliver his New Year's message.
In this moment, almost every television station in Dasha had begun to broadcast the live broadcast of the New Year's greetings. This link was still on all the major planets. Simal Cast Dashia had long since mastered the technology of quantum communication, and this was not a problem at all. So-called Quantum Communications was a type of communication in which information was transmitted through Quantum superposition states and entanglement effects. In short, it was possible to ignore the speed of light.
On the major planets, the TV host briefly introduced Luu's identity. It was very plain and unassuming, with no special title. Just a simple sentence: "Marshall Saints' only son." This aroused the interest of the 688 planets of Dashia and the countless populace. The 38 living planets that belonged to the Marshall Saints territory even erupted into a mountainous roar of cheers. From Luu's birth until now, it was highly confidential. Outsiders just simply knew the news but never knew the only son of the martial arts Saint.
In the end, what did it look like? It was finally time to see the real face. Even in other countries outside of Dashia, some people were broadcasting this TV program after receiving the news, causing a very high level of attention. It could be said that at this moment, there were countless people that were following the live broadcast.
Anyone else would be so nervous that they wouldn't be able to speak properly. It was good that Luu had a big heart. He looked subdued in front of the camera. Under the camera, Luu was tiny but looked extraordinarily graceful. Although there was a congratulatory script, Luu didn't even bother to read it. He directly looked at the camera and opened his mouth to say, "New Year's congratulations."
Meanwhile, the moment Luu You appeared on television, the chatter directly filled the major starfields. "Wow, so cute! This is the Marshall Saints' only son. What a little one! Just over a year old? I hear right. It's said that this year's virtual age has just turned three, but in actuality, it's less than two years old. Truly worthy of being the Marshall Saints' only son. He looks so calm and unruffled. It's awesome. I'm a fan of his now."
"Tiny is so cute. I want to pick him up." As I recall, his name was Luu. I didn't realize that he would be the one to come out and say New Year's congratulations this year. Haha, so special. It's best to come once a year so that we can witness the growth of the Marshall Saints' only son."
The popularity of Marshall Saint L changing naturally needed no introduction. The only Marshall Saint in the star Marshall calendar for 2,000 years was the key to the growth of the human community. In love with the house L U, the only son of the Marshall Sage received unbelievable attention for even a simple appearance to say a New Year's greeting.
In the meantime, in the great summer Heroes chat group, all the group members were a bit surprised after seeing the live broadcast. "I can't believe I'm seeing Big Brother on TV. Or the New Year's greeting session this time. Big Brother brushed his face in front of the entire human community on TV. Luu continued in a serious manner, "The years do not pass and the seasons flow like a stream. In the New Year, I hope everyone's body should be healthy. Happy New Year, everyone, and look to the future together."
Soon, Luu finished his New Year's greeting. It was a perfect ending. The sight of the conference hall as the people from the Marshall Saint faction led the clapping was impressive. How would the people from the other factions dare not give face? They also applauded one after another. For a moment, the applause was like thunder.
Even By Yuyo, after seeing this scene, couldn't help but feel proud of her son and somewhat happy in her heart. No matter what, this time, Luu's reading session live was considered to have accomplished it brilliantly. As Luu listened to the applause, he couldn't help but wave his hand again, not only greeting the people present but also greeting all the people of Dasha.
There's no doubt that this one swiped hard. The system's mission was not only accomplished; it was exceeded. Luu's reputation value broke through a billion directly after the live broadcast, reaching a terrifying 17.7 billion. The mission was arguably overachieved. The Dragon Tiger Gold pill came straight to hand. It was just a bit of a pity that this time, it wasn't a staged mission. Otherwise, you could have gleaned a few more rewards.

The live broadcast reached an audience of at least a few billion people, and this 17.7 billion in reputation wasn't an exaggeration. With a population of 6.88 billion across 688 living planets, it was indeed daunting. Simal casting was scary to think about. Luu shook his head and didn't dwell on it, then his eyes lit up as he looked at the Dragon Tiger Golden Pill. Chapter 20: For the Teacher was utterly dumbfounded. The Dragon Tiger Golden Pill was of the eighth quality, perfect type, and consumable. After taking it, it could increase one's lifespan by an additional 300 years and enhance cultivation, making the foundation stronger. It was described as a superior elixir that even ordinary people could take, though it would take an extremely long time to fully digest. Luu couldn't help but be surprised by the item's description. Surprisingly, it was an eighth-order treasure. The previous rewards had only been up to the seventh rank. The most crucial thing was that this eighth-order treasure could be taken by ordinary people. Although it said the digestion time was very long, this was normal. If not, ordinary people couldn't use it at all. Once eaten, such a treasure would not be in vain. He had gone through a lot of trouble and been busy for a long time; it was worth it. Luu could be very satisfied. Then, the system panel alerted that a new quest had appeared. Luu was slightly stunned; he hadn't expected the new mission to come so quickly. At this moment, the live broadcast had ended, and the camera had shifted. Luu looked at the new mission: "You have successfully captured 17.7 billion reputation points, perfectly accomplishing the task of growing your reputation and letting countless great subjects know that the son of the Marshal Saint is not simple. Some prestige can be gained in the general populace, and that's not enough. In the past few decades, the Marshal Sage has concentrated on fighting foreign enemies but never paid attention to Dasha political affairs. Without the strong support of the Marshal Sage, the days of the Marshal Sage faction in the cabinet have not been easy. Even though your father, Lu Chongxiong, doesn't seem to care about all this, you know that this is not going to work. Next, participate in political affairs as the son of the Marshal Sage and be recognized by the heads of the major factions. Mission reward: Ji Shin Chang sword." Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows as he read the mission's description. "Don't say the difficulty of this mission seems to be getting harder and harder. It's not right; it's always been hard. It didn't suddenly start being hard. The previous few missions were relatively easy for your current self, being too young, but the difficulty of the missions will definitely keep increasing as they are completed one by one. But the Marshal Sage sect is now in full bloom and is not declining like in the quest introduction. Technically speaking, the difficulty of this task may not be that exaggerated." Just as Luu was pondering this, Bayu Yya walked over and asked with a smile, "How does it feel?" "It feels okay," Luu said. "This time, you're showing your face in front of an unknown number of eyes," Bayu Yya said. "Yeah, Lu," Luu nodded. "Do you know that if you show your face like this, in the future, those foreign spies, the evil God familiars, will be even more attached to you?" Bayu Yya stared at him and said, "So ha." Luu couldn't help but be a bit dumbfounded. "It seems like that's still true. Admittedly, with 688 living planets synchronized live broadcasts, you could be said to be out of the limelight, and that's called a windfall. But the wind will destroy the wood that grows in the forest. As the son of a Marshal Saint, you've shown that you're not a bad person early on. The hostile forces of that human community naturally paid more attention to you than before. That's not good news. Seeing Luu with this worried look, Bayu Yya felt a bit amused. "You're just focusing on making a splash and talking about building up your reputation. Haven't you even considered this?" Luu nodded. Indeed, he hadn't thought too much about it. The question was still the same. Although Luu, despite having the mind of an adult, was still a child in body, sometimes the mind was affected by the body, and sometimes it just couldn't think too much. When it was a little more impulsive, and when it was a little less considered, some words and actions could be even more childlike. It was flawed but, in a way, kind of nice. After all, if it wasn't for this, Luu's old-fashioned appearance would have long since been detected as wrong by Lu Changxiong and many others.

The attention he received wouldn't be much less than that of foreigners. The evil God familiars were already set on him. Luu was torn, but after some thought, he let out a sigh and said, "This is something I can't avoid. If I want to wear the crown, I must bear its weight. If I want to clarify the world and change the heavens, then I must face one trouble after another. This one is not too much, and this one is not too little. There's no use agonizing here, so I'm not afraid of any of this. Mom, I'm going to keep going." Saying this, Luu's eyes became bright, leaving all those troubles behind. Bayu Ya couldn't help but freeze when she heard this. Just now, Bayu Ya could see that Luu was indeed scared, but he quickly overcame that fear. This kind of vigor, this kind of heart, could only be said to be worthy of being her and Lu Changshing's son.

Afterward, Luu thought about it carefully and, after seriously recalling it, he also reacted to the fact that Bayu Ya was scaring herself. No matter how menacing the political struggles at the top of Dashia were described or how serious the consequences of him being in the limelight were, they were actually scaring him. The purpose was to make Luu retreat. Was this to test him? Absolutely not, because Bayu Ya simply didn't want him to participate in political affairs. In that case, Luu then simply wouldn't have brought Bayu Ya to the council anyway.

After getting to know Xanga, who was Pop's disciple and a member of the Marshall Sacred Sect, he was considered someone who could be relied upon. Aha, and so it was happily decided. Turning to day two, Luu had Shonza come over to pick him up, and before he left, he waved his hand towards Bayu Ya. "Mom, I'm going to the cabinet to participate in politics. I'll see you when I get home." Bayu Ya glanced at Luu in surprise and then glanced at Shonza in dismay, and was powerless to speak for a moment. "What is this situation? This little guy actually disliked himself for scaring him all the time, so he dumped himself? Is this the nerve or the nerve to fly solo? Really not afraid to beat his ass himself?"

Shonza, who was next to Luu, faced Bayu Ya's questioning eyes with an embarrassed expression. "God, what's all this and what's all this? Originally, when Luu notified him and let him come over, Shonza was still quite happy, thinking that he could get in touch with his teacher son a little more. Who would have thought that this little brat before letting himself come over actually didn't even discuss it with his mom, just directly let him come over. It's something that the teachers mostly don't know about either. He was the spokesperson of the Marshall Sacred Sect, but he was caught in the middle at the moment, so it could be said that he was not a person inside or outside." Luckily, Bayu Ya didn't let him continue to make things difficult. After Bayu Ya glared at Luu, she then looked at Shonza and said seriously, "Then Luu is entrusted to you." A drop of cold sweat broke out on Shonza's forehead, and then he solemnly nodded. "I will definitely bring him out and back safely."

"Hurry up!" Luu took Shonza's hand and reached out to hug him. Although Luu had long been able to walk on his own, he was just a normal kid after all, and walking on his own was just too slow. As for Shonza, he was a Marshall King, and even though he was holding Luu and needed to support him, his speed was still no slower than an airplane. "Good," Shonza let out a bitter smile as he picked up Luu and then directly flew towards the sky.

In the stratosphere, 30 km above the ground, a spaceship was parked. After Shonza brought Luu here, he hurriedly drilled in. This was an A-Class spaceship. Although there was no way to compare it with Lu Changshing's Polaris, it wasn't too bad either. At least it was a Marshall King's seat. In the meantime, Li Wangai came back from vacation as Luu's initiation teacher, waiting for half a day but did not see the student. It is inevitable to find out. "When will Luu come over to study? You'll probably have to wait a little while longer. He's probably busy right now." Bayu Ya said somewhat helplessly. "What is he going to do?" Li Wangai was a bit curious. What could such a young child be busy with? "He went to the cabinet," Bayu Ya said. "Cabinet?" Li Wangai didn't react at first. "What does that mean?"

Bayu Ya let out a bitter smile before explaining. It was fine if this was not explained, but once it was explained, Li Wangai was directly dumbfounded.



Chapter 25 Deadly Silence

Along with the teacher, Li Guang Tha who was dumbfounded, there were also the heads of the major factions in the council chamber. As the saying goes, there are big meetings for small things and small meetings for big things. Often the smaller the number of people in a meeting is when big things are decided. At this time, this cabinet meeting the number of people is very small. Basically, all the major factions of the people one can be said to be a high position of power. Casually stomp a stomp more than a dozen life planets have to be shocked. But at this moment, all of these people, all of them, looked at the main location with a stunned expression. Here sits Chief Executive Officer Lou Hung Hong, and there's nothing wrong with that. But next to him, there was one tall kid sitting.

Here is a rewritten version of the text with improved English:

Chairman Liu, the only son of Marshall Saint, was clearly sitting among them. Many people had seen him before, so it was obvious that there was no mistake. The question on everyone's mind was, "What's going on here?" The expressions on the faces of the crowd were a wonder to behold. Some people looked dismayed, while others' brows furrowed in concern. Some even looked at each other, unsure of what to make of the situation. These people were masters at thinking several steps ahead and believed that there must be a reason behind any anomaly that occurred.

Wang, the youngest son, was sitting next to Li Shanghong, the CEO, who had been ousted by Wang's faction. Li Shanghong was the one who had thought that Marshall Saint was behind Wang's recent big move, and that was the reason why he was sitting next to Wang. The crowd was filled with speculation about what this could mean and how it would affect their own positions.

As Li Changxian sat down, he sent a signal of support to Li Shanghong. Everyone wondered if this was a sign of a bigger move to come. How would they respond? After all, Marshall Saint's intentions couldn't be directly confronted. As Luu ruminated on this, he thought to himself that this was a great spot to observe and listen to the others. Yesterday, he had come to complete his mission and understand the situation, but today was different. Today, he could take a closer look at how the country of Dasha was truly run.

Li Shanghong, who was sitting on the side, looked at Luu with pleading eyes in his mind, wondering why Luu had come and was sitting next to him. It was no secret, and it was hard not to notice. Chancellor Xunza gave him a look that seemed to say, "Don't look at me." Li Shanghong sighed and subconsciously glanced at Luu, who said, "Let them begin their deliberations. Don't worry, I won't play around." Chancellor Xunza nodded, and the meeting continued.

However, the crowd noticed the change in Li Shanghong's expression. It was not as simple as before. Soon, people started speculating about all sorts of things. Luu held his head and listened with interest. He realized that these people were high-ranking officials, but they were discussing ordinary political matters like the development of a mineral planet, the borders of a revolt, and the mobilization of troops for natural disasters. Most people would probably doze off listening to this, but Luu was different. He listened with great interest.

Finally, someone couldn't help himself and asked, "Your Excellency, the Grand Executive Officer, could I ask why Marshall Saint's only son would appear here today?" As soon as the words came out, everyone's attention was drawn to them. They all looked up to try to understand the meaning behind Luu's appearance. Many people wanted to ask this question, but they held back. When the question was finally asked, Li Shanghong opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was lost for how to answer.

As for Marshall Saint's intentions, it was unclear. Li Shanghong looked at Chancellor Xunza, who just shook his head. Was this a sign that he didn't know, or was he just not willing to say it? Li Shanghong was just about to brush it off when Luu spoke up, "What's your name?" The voice was clear and childlike, but every word was very clear.

"You're called Junglen, aren't you?" Luu asked. The person who asked the question smiled and said, "That's right!" Then, "Which faction are you from?" Luu continued to ask more questions. Tong Janglin's heart was filled with unease. Why was he the only one asking these questions? He was afraid, but he knew he couldn't back down. "We're all working for Dasha," he said stiffly. "What's the point of talking about factions? Are you afraid to speak out?"

Luu listened to Tong Janglin's expression and continued to ask, "Unable to help but think you're lying to a child, how can you be qualified to sit here and deliberate without the support of a faction?" This kind of agitation was of little use to Tong Janglin, who didn't know what to say. "Don't be afraid, I'm not going to eat you. If I don't say it, I can still ask someone else," Luu said, feeling that his identity was really good.

There was also a powerful Marshall Saint faction; every word he said made people think. Tong jongan's scalp tingled slightly, and after a long while, he still spoke. Technically speaking, I'm from the new economy faction, a new economic faction what do you advocate for, Lou? 

You asked with some curiosity, Tong jeonglan, obviously he had asked the question first, but now it had turned into a question between you and him. Luu, he couldn't afford not to answer, otherwise, he would be refuting you, the face of the wuang faction Tong jangan had to simply state his faction's claims. After Luu heard this, he nodded, "That's right, he understood, but not completely. Understanding the claims of a faction is not enough; between three words, it requires a more in-depth understanding, but it's obviously not a good time."

Lou thought for a moment and spoke, "I can answer the question you just asked, although you didn't ask me. I think it would be better if I answered you." He came over to hear how the deliberations were done, to get a better visualization of how the country of Dasha was run, to see what the hell you guys were doing, what was causing the entire human community to be riddled with ills and a corrupt system. "I know that it's slightly inappropriate for me, a little kid, to show up in a place like this, but I think the rules are dead, and people are alive, and they can be changed, slightly."

There was a dead silence within the council chamber as a pin fell. The cabinet ministers were a bit confused, although everyone knew that the Marshall Saint's only son, Luu, was very smart, but they never dreamed that at this moment, he would say something like this. "What that means is he came this way purely on his own terms, not what the sage of Wu meant, but the problem is, a three-year-old is starting to think about how the country works."

Just by looking what has caused the human community system to become corrupt and full of ills, this is too much, when they were three, they were still playing in the mud, if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes and heard it with their own ears, at this moment, they definitely wouldn't believe that a small child, as young as 3 years old, could speak such words, it's not just precocious anymore.

Tong jungan of the new economy faction at this moment, had his eyes wide open, and he directly stayed in place, his expression was very wonderful, even the nearby Grand Executive Officer, Lu xang Hong, and jonza from the Marshall Saint faction, had their mouths open. "I'm asking you, why don't you say anything, LU, you looked at the dumbfounded Tong janlin and spoke again, this Tong janlin was momentarily speechless, not knowing what to say."

He had opened his mouth to inquire not because he was forbidding Luu to come here, but because he wanted to ask about the purpose of his coming here, he wanted to know what kind of information the Marshall Saint, Lu Chong shung had released, so that he could be prepared.

"Who would have thought, that the answer he got at this moment could be a far cry from what he expected. For a moment, he was at a loss, as to how to answer, to be honest, he was a little confused," after so many years in politics, how many big storms had come and gone, what situations had he not seen, at this moment, he didn't know how to speak, it was really the first time he'd encountered this."

Tong janglin slowly shook his head and sat down again, soon after the meeting was over, these cabinet dignitaries couldn't help but glance at Luu, who had gotten down from the kid's dining chair, Luu also looked at the group with an expression of eagerness, as he wanted to tug on people one by one, and ask about them, ask about everything.

The Grand Executive Officer Luu Xang Hong was questioned by Su Lang, the spokesperson for the Renovation Faction, regarding his earlier words. Su Lang inquired if they were all true, to which Luu Xang Hong merely nodded. It seemed that the Marshall Saint was content to allow his son, Su Lang, to engage in activities here.

Su Lang asked again if he was "fooling around," to which Luu Xang Hong replied that Su Lang's presence itself was a form of folly. As the only son of the Marshall Saint, Su Lang was still quite young, and his actions could attract unwanted attention.

Luu Xang Hong joked that if there truly was someone with ill intentions, then Su Lang, in charge of the Innovation School, might be that person. He suggested that if Su Lang had any concerns, he should voice them directly to the Marshall Saint.

Su Lang wanted to say more, but Luu Xang Hong interrupted him and left the room. Luu then took his seat in the cabinet to observe the government proceedings.

Luu had come to learn about the country's inner workings and identify the system's flaws, but no one took his words seriously. Some even speculated that Luu's presence was a sign of support for the executive officers.

Luu was still a member of the Marshall Sacred Sect, and it was not uncommon for those in power to be misunderstood. Moreover, Luu was still a child, and it was normal for him to be overlooked.

Before this, Luu had anticipated that he could not control others' perceptions. This had sparked much discussion, with some even questioning the Marshall Saint's motives.

Lu Chang Shing's response was simple: he had merely allowed Luu to explore the world. Upon returning home, Bayu Yuyo teasingly asked about the political discussion. Luu replied that he could not disclose the details, as he had promised to keep cabinet matters confidential.

Bayu Yuyo found Luu's appearance at the cabinet amusing and commented that he had caused quite a stir among the other cabinet members. They believed that the Marshall Saint's faction was making significant moves, with even the Marshall Saint's only son in attendance.

Luu Xang Hong explained that the faction simply enjoyed being seen as important. Bayu Yuyo remarked that if they truly wanted to make a big move, they wouldn't need a child to stand on the stage. They were either looking down on the Marshall Saint or the Marshall Saint's faction, which was self-serving to think about it that much.

Upon seeing his teacher, Luu immediately stood up to leave. Bayu Yuyo asked if he would still attend the cabinet the next day, to which Luu replied affirmatively. He would listen to politics in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon, demonstrating his exceptional time management skills.

Bayu Yuyo was momentarily speechless, finding Luu's political obsession unusual. Luu then bid farewell to the Senior Maiden and left the room.

In haste, but not in haste, your master wishes to meet you. Head to the cultivation field in the backyard, YuYo said with a smile. Upon hearing this, Gonza was instantly spirited. Indeed, after years of raising a child, there may be no merit, but there is certainly painstaking work. Finally, he could meet his master, Shonza, whom he hadn't seen for a long time. At this moment, Gonza was inexplicably nervous.

"Go on," YuYo said. Gonza nodded hurriedly. Inside the small courtyard, Ri Guang looked at his own student with a complicated face. Although he knew that this one was the Marshall Saint's only son and his status was honored to the extreme, he still couldn't believe his ears when he heard the news this morning. A three-year-old going to a place like the cabinet to listen to politics? Is there something wrong here? Even though you're the son of a martial arts saint, you're too out there. Even the cabinet hearings are here. This is just too much.

In fact, Luu himself understood that his demeanor was a bit out of character, a little too reckless. But there's no way around it. The quests issued by the system were formulated according to the Luu of 40 years later. How is it possible to consider that he's only 2 years old? If it was Luu 40 years later representing the Marshall Sage faction to participate in politics in the cabinet to get back some face and gained the recognition of the major factions, it could be considered reasonable and without any problems. But for Luu who had just turned 3 years old and was still a false age, that would be a bit of a violation.

The question is, by virtue of the system, Luu had engaged in a variety of rewards, although most of the rewards because the age is too young cannot yet be used. But it was foreseeable that once Luu turned 3 years old and could practice marshal arts, he would definitely soar and display a terrifying talent. This madness of taking all sorts of benefits and constantly pulling the wool over the system didn't spit on the system's mission. Now that the mission has progressed here, it's time to start disliking it. That naturally won't work. Doesn't that make you a double standard dog? Luu is not such a person. So even if the task was difficult, Luu would try to do it. Whether it's recognized by Major factions of cabinet ministers or to gain more recognition from your peers, that previous stage mission, Luu hadn't forgotten yet. He completed the first stage, the second stage, and got the lower grade Heaven and Earth wonders and the middle-grade Heaven and Earth wonders. There's still phase three to come and phase four to go. Only this third stage, the fourth stage of the mission, the difficulty was too high and with the emergence of other missions, it was shelved for the time being. But that didn't mean that Luu intended to give up on it.

When classes ended in the afternoon, Luu initiated a party in the heroes of Dasha chat group. That's a pretty full schedule, I must say. The meeting place was still the Marshall Saint's Mansion. Luu's home was big enough that he didn't have to worry about running out of room. Moreover, Luu was too small and his status was extraordinarily outrageous, so going out alone or anything else was out of the question for the time being. Luu thought this was normal, having enjoyed the conveniences that come with this status. Something has to be taken on, whether it's the responsibility that the sons of the Marshall Saints have to bear or the constraints that come with that status in this world. How can there be a person who only enjoys his rights but does not want to fulfill his obligations?

Faced with this request from Luu, the Elders of these families read agreed. They couldn't wait to hope that their own children could have more contact with Luu for a while. Only this time, the homeboys were specifically instructed not to get into any more trouble. The location is still the Yuyo Pavilion. Luu sat at the first place and looked at the people who were seated in their respective seats in a good mood. He gradually understood why some rich people always like to invite people to dinner. Jackie Chan, for example, likes to treat his Jackie Chan family to dinner and shopping and can be extremely generous to his brothers. Another example is the ancient poet Leai, who also liked to organize various banquets and invited guests to dinner, which was even more lavish. What's that poem? A thousand pieces of gold are scattered but they come back again, and cooking sheep and slaughtering cows is a pleasure, and you'll have to drink 300 cups in one go. Going further, Lu Bang also liked to organize banquets where he often drank and sang. That's really grandiose to the core. Luu and his previous life could not understand this strange hobby. Now, though, after a few treats, he could gradually understand the beauty of it. Turns out it's really fun. The only downside is that small children can't drink, so the crowd had to settle for juice or milk instead. The people drank milk for fun and chatted with abandoned and good cheer. Someone is up and dancing. Some people also perform their family martial arts on the spot. The atmosphere of the scene can be extraordinarily pleasant. Luu sipped and sipped and realized that this milk was quite enjoyable.

He stood directly on the chair and then jumped to the center of the stage, saying with a smile, "Who's going to wrestle with me? If anyone can knock me down, I'm willing to give up my position as the leading brother." Lu You, who was only 3 years old, looked at the visitor and said, "It's you, Kong. It seems like you're not convinced of me as the leading brother."

In Kong, who was 8 years old and already close to 1 meter 5, looked like a small adult compared to Lu You. He was not convinced of Lu You's abilities, as he had only become the Big Brother due to his status as the son of the Marshall Saint. Many of the people present felt that it would be an unfair matchup, as Lu You had not practiced martial arts, while Kong had.

Despite these concerns, Kong stepped forward to wrestle with Lu You. However, Lu You refused to give even a single step, much to the surprise of the crowd. Lu You was much smaller in stature, and it seemed like there was no way he could win.

However, there was one exception to this belief - Yang Guanin, who had seen Lu You's terrifying strength before. He did not think that Kong was bound to win.

As the crowd favored Kong, Yang Guanin laughed and cursed disdainfully, "A bunch of idiots and fools. Do you really think that Big Brother dares to find someone to wrestle with without a single card? That's too ridiculous."

The crowd fell silent at Yang Guanin's words, including Kong. He glanced suspiciously at Lu You and then at Yang Guanin. "What kind of cards are you talking about?" he wondered.

With doubts in their minds, the two began to wrestle. Kong's footsteps were light and fast, but when he tried to exert his strength, he felt like he was hugging a Heavenly tree. No matter how hard he pushed, the other side didn't move.

Kong's eyes widened in disbelief, and he couldn't help but cry out in shock. But Lu You remained calm, smiling and casually flinging his hand. Kong fell to the ground without even the slightest ability to resist.

The people present were wide-eyed, unable to believe what they had just seen. The son of the Marshall Saint, who was said to be terrifying, had lost so simply. Some people couldn't help but suck in a breath.

Yaning smiled as cold air enveloped them and said, "See, I was right, wasn't I? I still think the big brother is easy." These words caused some people to worship on the spot, believing Luu was truly extraordinary. However, there were others who questioned this, finding it outrageous. They suspected that Kong was playing a fake match, losing on purpose to Luu. The purpose was clear: to make everyone believe Luu, the leading brother, deserved his name.

Faced with such accusations, Kong's expression turned ugly. He retorted, "Who is this insulting me, playing a fake game? What a joke. Just try it yourself, and you'll see." Siden then said, "Anyway, I've lost. Now, let another person step forward to test Luu's power."

Without exception, those who came forward were directly knocked down by Luu, one after another. A total of six people tried and all were defeated. Luu's victory was effortless. He flung his arm and smiled, challenging, "Who else? Who else? One more time, I have to say it's fun to bully kids."

Unfortunately for Luu, no one came forward again for a while. This time, everyone was convinced of Luu's genuine awesomeness and that he wasn't colluding to play a fake game. His natural divine power was too scary, even for the pinnacle of the first realm. No one could match the big brother's divine power.

Someone shouted, "We are convinced," and it was instantly echoed by a chorus. This time, everyone was sincere. Luu nodded in satisfaction and returned to his position. He glanced at the taskbar, noting that the mission status was at 4250. This confrontation between the parties added a significant amount of progress. However, it hadn't even completed the third stage, suggesting that the previous speculation was likely true. There might not have been many of Luu's companions after all, as the mission called for companions 40 years from now, and the group from 40 years ago might not be the same as the group 40 years into the future.

With this in mind, the back room brought a roasted whole lamb. Luu waved his hand to bring it over and stood up, saying, "Come, I'll split the meat for you." He then effortlessly broke the roasted whole lamb's leg bone with a crisp sound. The crowd was astonished as they witnessed this.

Luu addressed them, "Since you all recognize me as the leading brother, then I will share the meat with you." Whether it was this piece of meat or the ones to come, as long as they considered Luu their big brother, everything would be shared with them. The people present, despite their young age, had extraordinary origins. They had been influenced by insights since childhood, making them not ordinary. They understood that Luu's words meant more than just dividing the meat; it also meant sharing the prophecy. A big brother who was willing to share his meat was a good big brother. It would be a mistake to think that being the leader meant having all the meat to oneself. Sharing the meat and status would win the hearts of the people, regardless of one's honorable status.

After the meat-sharing was over, a hint of mission completion appeared in front of Luu's eyes. The third stage of the mission was complete, and he gained the recognition of 50 companions. He also acquired a top-quality Heaven and Earth rare treasure, the Tao Big Dipper Soul Suppressor Stone, of eighth quality and excellent type. It was wearable and had the effect of calming the soul, effectively protecting the wearer's divine soul and Sea of Consciousness from spiritual attacks. The Big Dipper, one of the ancient gods, was said to have been born when Heaven and Earth were first divided and Chaos opened up, giving birth to 36 big dippers and 72 earthly furies. This precious stone generated by the big dipper's chi had the purest big dipper aura. Luu was delighted to learn about its additional efficacy, as it was another eighth-order treasure and a rare spirit-based defensive equipment. In the current Star Marshal age, spiritual defensive equipment was rarer and more precious than physical defense equipment.

There were already countless forefathers who had walked out a complete path, so many people in other professions were usually practicing on the side, trying to get out of their own way. For example, arms masters, mechm medicine masters, Nemesis masters, alien masters, and so on. An ordinary martial artist, when facing these special martial artists, would suffer a great loss if they were not careful. For example, a yenly martial artist against a martial artist of the same realm was basically crushed and could even easily accomplish cross-battle.
But at a time like this, if there was a spiritual defense equipment, the advantage of a yenly martial artist would be gone. On top of that, when facing extraterrestrial evil gods, as well as evil gods' familiars and evil god science, the equipment of spiritual defense was even more important. Ordinary martial artists could only rely on their own martial will to resist the effect. Naturally, it was possible, but almost every time, they suffered a different degree of injury. Once the spirit was severely polluted and the divine soul was completely corrupted, it was likely that it not be cured for the rest of one's life. That's why any piece of mental defense equipment, when placed outside, was a treasure that everyone fought over.
What's more, this Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul suppressor Stone was still of the eighth Rank, and its value was absolutely terrifying. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a superior Treasure of Heaven and Earth. With such a treasure, it would be a waste of effort for any evil god followers or evil god dependents to try to attack Lu You with spiritual pollution in the future. It could be said that in terms of safety, a great deal of security was guaranteed.
Lu You could be very satisfied with this reward. Take another look at the progress of this particular Mission. The current Mission progress is 52/100, 48 companion endorsements away from the final task of phase 4. So much more to go. So it seems that trying to complete the fourth stage is not normally difficult. I've been working on this quest for so long, and I'm still halfway through the progress. The key thing was that this Quest had a one-month time limit, so you couldn't even think of putting it off until later.
But the question is, what exactly are the childhood companions for him? 40 years later, at the moment, only about half of the people here counted as his childhood companions because at the moment, it's another tussle and the promise of splitting the meat that's brought the progress bar up to a modest 52 out of 100. That means there are many more companions that are not around. This system doesn't know how to make a list or anything. It's too much trouble. Just a top-grade Heaven and Earth wonder, and you can get the so-called suppressing Stone of the Tao Heavenly Dipper. What about the absolute best of the world's wonders, and what kind of goodies will you get?
Luu was greedy and wanted it badly. How should this be broken? Luu frowned and let out a small sigh. W Yu Guan Chang, who was on the side, saw Liu sighing, and he immediately came over and asked, "Big brother, why are you sighing?" When Yuguan Ching said this, he even deliberately imitated the lines and cadence from the TV series, which could be described as a perfect rendition.
When Liu You heard this, he couldn't help but be stunned and then, after thinking about it, he spoke, "I'm very happy that the group of Heroes have gathered here today, but I think that in the future, if we want to change the heavens and clarify the Jade Kingdom, most of the people here right now will still not be enough. I want to meet more Heroes and heroines and enlist more talents so that they can come together here and work together for a great cause. I wonder what you think about that."
When Yaning heard these words, he smiled and said, "Big brother, how difficult is this? In my opinion, this matter is as easy as a slap in the face. At this moment, Yaning was on the scene, all in the appearance of a dog-headed military adviser. May I hear about it?"
Luu was also very cooperative, hurriedly pulling Yaning to sit next to himself, and also poured milk for him with a courteous and serious attitude of asking for advice. Big Brother, the method is simple. Yuguan Ching was very receptive to Luu's courtesy and took a sip of milk before slowly saying, "Since there are so many Heroes and heroines right here, let the heroes pull the heroes to come. Let the heroes introduce the heroes to come here. Wouldn't that be fine?"
Is this feasible? Luu subconsciously asked. When he heard this, Yaning said seriously with Big Brother's virtuous name out there, "Which hero, which hero doesn't want to get involved? This is their honor. Good idea, Luu."
Luu nodded and gave a high affirmation. However, there are requirements for pulling people in. If they are not Heroes and heroines, they cannot enter our Circle. Yaning didn't have the intention of indiscriminately pulling people in. If anyone could come in, it would be too much of a drop in class. The standards set by Yaning are high. If you want to enter their Circle, you should at least have a marshal king sitting in your family. Right, and you have to be a direct descendant of that Marshal King. If it's the kind of relative that you can't even think about, then don't even think about it. Of course, family history is not the only Criterion in Ying's opinion. As long as one was talented enough, it was fine, even if one's family lineage was poor. For example, that kind of terrifying demon who, at this moment, was on the scene all in the appearance of a dog-headed military adviser. May I hear about it?

By the age of seven or eight, they had already reached the Third Realm of the Marshall Dao, or even the Fourth Realm. Such a hero and heroine would surely achieve great things in the future. Even if they didn't have much family history, they were equally qualified to enter the circle. If you don't have a family and aren't a genius among geniuses, I'm sorry, but you're not qualified to play with us. Under Luou U's authorization, Yaning told everyone present about the matter. They should pull people over since the future wants to clarify the world and change the sky and the earth. We must unite all the forces that can be united. As long as there are more and more friends, won't there be fewer and fewer enemies? Luou felt that it was a good idea to continue this Hero's conference. Dashia's Hero's circle will be very scary in the future. However, this seems to be the only son of the Marshall Sage. The correct way to open the banquet, various heroes and heroines used their connections to keep pulling people in. For a moment, the whole big summer blue star could be said to be wind-up clouds. Marshall St. L. Ching's connections were very wide, but he wasn't familiar with all Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors. However, after constantly pulling people in through the Grandia Heroes chat group, he was able to see almost all the direct descendants of Martial Kings and martial Emperors. Needless to say, this is a very exaggerated situation. In such a group of powerful and noble martial arts families and geniuses, only Luou, the only son of the martial Saint, could hold down the scene. After all, Dashia only had his father, this one martial arts Saint. The competition among fathers who could beat him in the group was only one person, whose name was Xiao Jing. His father's name was Xia Wuan, and his realm was a Marshall Emperor. However, he was different from ordinary Marshall Emperors. Many people called him the Marshall Emperor, Great Perfection, half-step Marshall Saint, the future second Marshall Saint. It was said that he had once been Lu Ching's life and death friend, but due to the wear and tear of his Marshal will and the contamination of his spiritual realm during a battle with the evil God, he had been recuperating at home. Originally, he really did have a certain chance to break through to the Marshall Saint realm, but unfortunately, ever since that injury, he had lost a certain opportunity to break through. To this day, it was said that the contamination of the spiritual realm had been repaired, and the Marshal will was intact, but there had been no news of any further advancement in Marshall cultivation. Lu Ching had visited several times and was extremely sorry about this. Lu Chong Xiang was not a small-minded person; on the contrary, he longed for another Marshall Saint more than anyone else, so the burden on his shoulders would be much easier. Even though Xia Yuan didn't have the means to break through to the 10th realm, his Marshall Emperor Grand Circle strength wasn't something an ordinary Marshall Emperor could touch. Similar to Lu Ching's situation, this Xiao Jing was also Xia Yuan's only son, and he was just 7 years old this year. However, something different was that Xiao Jing's character was more introverted and quiet, unlike Lu U's unbridled exuberance. But all in all, his joining proved one thing: nowadays, Lu U's small circle was already very powerful. For Lu U, this was good news. The fourth stage of the mission, which was still so far away, finally had the possibility of being completed. If that didn't work, then there really was nothing he could do. Turning to the next day, at Lu U's request, Shono once again went to the Lu family and brought Lu U to the cabinet to listen to politics. Ever since he met his master Lu Chong yesterday, Jonza had been extraordinarily attentive to this, and there was no doubt that this was a good opportunity to get in touch with his teacher. If the other senior brothers and sisters knew that he still went to the 10,000 Laws Building for enlightenment, they would be red with envy. Chagona looked at Lu U, who was eating breakfast, with interest and casually asked, "I heard that you organized a circle." Lu U ate his breakfast and said vaguely, "You know all this. The commotion is not small. Oh, how could I not know this?" Shono said with a smile, "Lou, you, making more friends is a good thing, but only if you can control so many people. Shono slowly spoke, 'If what they bring you is not benefits but endless trouble, then that's putting the cart before the horse.' When Lu heard this, he couldn't help but be a little surprised. He really did not expect Jonza to say something like this. I have to say, it makes a lot of sense. It's true that having more friends is a good thing, but with that come some trouble. Let's just say that true to form, top politicians all see things from a completely different perspective. Lu U nodded and hurriedly put down the food in his hands, sat upright with a look of earnestly asking for advice, and opened his mouth and asked, "Do you have any good advice? Please also teach me." When Jon Gonza saw that Lu U reacted so quickly and directly, he climbed up the pole looking for his own experience and couldn't help but directly freeze. It's still a human child that said, "Is it really good to teach?"

Such a young child, with such thick and dark tactics, the master and mistress won't come after you, will they? But Jonza thought for a second. Didn't Master Sheru let Luu go to listen to politics, just to let him see all this? Shonza thought for a moment and directly began to teach Luu. You listened attentively, his big eyes, full of childish innocence, flooded with light, making Zonza feel too dirty, and he was a little embarrassed to continue. But just a little teaching, some let Luu in his heart couldn't help but sigh. Really worthy of top politicians, ah! A simple sentence, there are 800 heart and soul, whether it is the means of doing things or the art of dumping are breathtaking.

The speed of the spaceship was fast, and in a short while, Luu was brought to the cabinet by Zonza. These cabinet ministers, in regards to Luu's arrival, had changed from being shocked at first to being numb. Now, the power of habit is terrifying, and Luu, who yesterday was impossible for them to ignore, has subconsciously been ignored today. Luu sat on a child's dining chair and listened attentively to the deliberations of this group of cabinet ministers. Today is going to be a little more exciting than yesterday. For example, one cabinet member accuses another of the crime of withholding supplies from the front and enriching himself. Another person immediately responded that he had already found out that there weren't that many people at the front line at all, and the numbers were completely unequal, so the deduction was reasonable and did not pose any problem. That person immediately said that there was a problem with the results of your investigation, and that the actual situation was not like that at all, and that the little evidence alone was not enough to make such an inference. Another person again gave a response. The result is that the two men were not convinced by each other and had a direct quarrel.

However, the quarrels of cabinet ministers are naturally different from those of ordinary people. In each of their words, there are clips and sticks, and even if there is not a single dirty word, every sentence is a word that kills the heart. Luu watched from the sidelines with a melon and a pair of big sparkling eyes, having fun. Finally, an interesting scene.

Chapter 31: The World is a Giant Straw Man

Scenes of mutual quarrels in the cabinet are actually not uncommon. It's only rarely that you get along and get along like did yesterday. Needless to say, the world is a giant straw man. This would be true even for a place like the Dasha cabinet. In the eyes of outsiders, the Dasha cabinet is like a Heavenly Court, unfathomable. Smelling a hint of breath inside may be able to achieve immortality, but in reality, these cabinet ministers quarrel in addition to their own aura and the grandpa and grandma in the vegetable market, it seems to be no different.

As he listened, he heard some of the truth of it. What the two sides are fighting for is not right or wrong, but interest. That's a good point. Only children distinguish between right and wrong. Adults only look at the pros and cons. Both sides have their own words, have their own reasoning, arguing for half a day but cannot be divided into a result. Eventually, they looked at the Grand Executive Officer, LV Shang Hong. Luu understood the so-called big exec. Turns out to be a referee. Some matters that are contentious and refuse to budge from each other are put at the disposal of the big executive side.

Lu Shang Hong frowned, thinking for a moment and gave a result: "Let's take a step back on each side. On your side, spit out a portion of the supply. On the other side, ask for less supplies." When the people on both sides heard the result, they saw fit to stop arguing. Luu was surprised to look at Lu Shang Hong. "Good guy, this is in the mud, right? No, the way you guys handle things is too casual."

Luu has the natural ability of Unforgettable. Yesterday, over a trip today, has memorized the faces of all the cabinet members. I don't know what their names are or what faction they actually belong to, but I can probably tell who's who. You can also get a rough idea of where they stand by the topics they argue about. Of course, this alone is not a complete conclusion. It is because these cabinet members, one after another, are basically old and cunning people, and their position can be changed at any time.

When the proceedings were over, Luu took the lead and grabbed the hand of the person who had started the argument in the first place. The man looked at Luu with a stunned expression. "Can you tell me what your name is? Which faction are you from?" Luu wasn't polite and directly started checking his account. "What are you asking for?" the man asked curiously. "I find you interesting," Luu gave his answer. The man was speechless for a while then spoke, "My name is XO Yanjun. I'm from the United faction and the Integrity faction. And you can join two factions at the same time."

Luu asked with some curiosity. "Normally, you can't," X Yanjun explained. "But the power of many factions is too small, and they join together to give birth to the United faction, so that's how it is."

"That's how it is," Luu came to a realization, nodded and said, "You are the Integrity faction, but that person is attacking you with withholding supplies from the front line and enriching himself. His heart can be punished. No wonder this Xan Jun's reaction was so agitated just now. If this thing is sat down, then it is not only Xan Jun's problem alone..."

Here is the improved English version of the text:

The entire Integrity faction behind him is going to be a big problem in this way. It seems that just a simple meeting can have such horrible consequences. The atmosphere in the cabinet is really tense, and the slightest carelessness can capsize the ship. If we look at it from this perspective, the big executive officer, Luou Shang Hong, made the right choice to make peace with the situation. Being a peacemaker is not an easy thing to do, and if you're not careful, you're likely to offend both sides. After chatting for a while longer, Luu let go of Jiyuan and found the man who had argued with Hyouka. The man was chatting with the others, and Luu saw an opportunity to grab his hand. "Can you tell me what your name is and which faction you're from?" LUu asked directly. The man was taken aback for a while but still answered patiently, "My name is Wu Bao Yuan. Technically, I'm from the Main War faction." "Just now, Jiyuan said that you drink soldiers' blood, is that true?" LUu asked directly. Wu Bao Yuan's face turned red, and he cursed, "Dog's slobber! Jiyuan doesn't even know the miseries of the Hellstar battlefield. He just stands on the moral high ground, spouting nonsense. Sooner or later, I'll tear his hypocritical mask apart." "One day, Brother Wubo, restrain yourself, in front of the child," someone at the side spoke up quickly. "What's your name and what faction are you from?" LUu looked at this person next to him. "I'm Wubo Yuan's friend, Jin Ping. I'm from the Main Peace faction." "Sure, Jin Ping replied, smiling. Even though we have different political views, we're both from Dasha, so why can't we be friends?" LUu couldn't help but feel some admiration when he heard these words. At this time, Shonzo looked over and picked LUu up in a hug. "Time to go home, boy! See you tomorrow, uncle!" LUu didn't resist and waved his little hand towards the two of them. Wubo Yuan and Sh Jin Ping were also very friendly and waved their hands towards him. When LUu returned to Zon's spaceship, he recounted what had just happened. For example, the conflict between X O Jiyuan and Wubo Yuan... Another example was the friendship between Wubo Yuan and Xinping, who were obviously one of the warmongers and the other of the peacers. But they were on very good terms with each other. Shang Hong then explained the reason to LUu. "First, there was the issue of Wubo Yuan drinking soldiers' blood. Things are not that simple. The Hellstar battlefield could be described as a place of true horrors and extreme tragedy. It's reasonable to ask for more supplies in order to keep the big picture going. For the most part, those supplies would still go to the soldiers, and some would be handed out as a death and action pension." LUu nodded when he heard this. "As for the people of the Main War faction and the Main Peace faction, why are they getting along?" LUu was curious. "Why is it almost the same, you ask?" Shang Hong explained. "The so-called Main Peace faction is not to eliminate all enemies, but to win in a way that makes us all benefit, which is why we can get along." LUu couldn't help but be a bit speechless, playing word games. Not long after, LUu returned home and after having lunch, he studied with his teacher. Again, by the time it was evening, LUu said about organizing a party, whether it's the main quest to gain the approval of the cabinet ministers or a special mission to gain the approval of 100 companions, LUu was not giving up. Two hands, however, left him with a slight time crunch. By Yuya was somewhat speechless at this. "How does this kid make it seem like he is busier than his father?" Later that night, By Yuya touched LUu's head and asked curiously, "I see that you've been organizing banquets every day. Aren't you tired?" LUu lying in By Yuya's arms for a long time, but did not see to speak. By Yuya looked down, "This child actually already asleep." Chapter 32: The week cannot easily criticize the strong. LUu was indeed tired. It's a tight schedule these days. The average three-year-old wouldn't have that kind of energy. Play for a couple of hours, then you have to take a nap. And LUu almost has the same routine as adults now, no nap time either. Thanks to the transformation of his body by the Da Emerald and the Dragon Tiger Golden Dan, LUu's current body is not comparable to that of an ordinary three-year-old child. But even so, it was still a bit tiring, after all, no matter what, when he says he's three, he's actually only a year eight or nine months old now, and his energy is limited. Turning to the next day, LUu decided to take a day off and not go to the cabinet to listen to politics in the cabinet. Cabinet ministers who came here one after another saw that next to the big executive officer, there was no familiar children's dining chairs and couldn't help but be stunned. "That's the son of the Marshall Sage, didn't he come today?" Some people still felt a little weird. "There's always something missing." It had to be said that when there was LUu around, everyone would be slightly more restrained when they argued, none of them swearing so much.

Making a move now without Luu out of the picture, things are back to the way they were before, so some people are starting to miss Luu's presence, especially since his son, Li Chang, the only son of the Marshall Saints, is now sitting here. It seemed like a good idea in the meantime for Luu to stay at home, where he is currently watching TV after finishing breakfast, as he has started eating staple foods. Interestingly, Luu hasn't been drinking milk as often since his quest to gain the approval of the cabinet ministers has begun to show some progress, even if he hasn't yet met with the cabinet. At this moment, it's clear that his quest progress bar has grown a bit, even if he hasn't done anything significant yet.

After a while, Lu Chang Chung unexpectedly arrived and sat next to Luu, which is unusual since Li Chang Xang is often very busy, even appearing only once a month, and rarely sits with him and watches TV together. Luu momentarily froze, staring at this cheap old man, and wondered what was wrong. Lu Chang Xang looked up at him and said, "Dad, rarely watches TV with me, so I was a bit surprised." When he heard Lu Chang Xang's honest words, he felt a little heartbroken. His schedule during the week was just too busy, which meant he would have much less time to spend with the kids. This is why he's been trying to fulfill all his requests, even if they were overly foolish. "What are you watching?" Lu Chang Xang changed the subject and glanced at the TV, which was showing a military battle on the Hellstar. "You're interested in fighting," Lu Chang Xang surmised. "No," Luu replied, "I'm just interested in this battle." Lu Chang Xang nodded and asked, "How do you feel about this matter?" Luu thought for a moment and replied, "I think both sides make sense. However, I think it's the fact that the system isn't set up well enough that caused this situation to arise. If the system is relatively better, it should be able to avoid this situation."

Li Chang Xang froze for a moment, but didn't react too much. Luu's words were just too simple and naive for him to expect anything more from his son. In Luu's mind, there were too many unimpressive things that had been shown, which made his words seem plausible to him. He continued, "Do you have any good suggestions, Dad?" Li Chang Xang asked. Luu shook his head and replied, "I'm too small and have little knowledge to give advice, and I'm too small to have actually experienced or gone to Hellstar. Who am I to give advice?" Li Chang Xang looked at his son, seemingly proud that his son had grown up some more and had learned the value of being hands-on and adapting to situations. He added quietly to himself, "This steadiness is very rare."

Just as Li Chang Xang wanted to speak, Luu continued to discuss systems, saying, "Systems are dead, people are alive, and even the most perfect system will always have this problem. There is actually no such thing as a perfect system." He spoke with a serious face, "As far as I know, Dad, over time, these systems will show a variety of problems and cannot be completely blamed on anyone. Dad, can you... reflect on it now that there are so many problems?" Lu Chang Xang was speechless for a while.

However, Luu continued, highlighting that even the most well-designed systems have their flaws. He then shifted the conversation to suggest that, if there are too many problems, the person in charge (Lu Chang Xang, in this case) should think about improving the system. Lu Chang Xang still felt that there was nothing to worry about, but Luu's words hit him hard. It was only when he saw the pain in Luu's face that he realized why Bayu Yao had been beating him.

Despite being an adult, Luu is often treated like a child, even by his own grown children. However, Luu does not wish to be childish all the time. There were instances when, despite knowing he would be punished, he would confront them head-on. In fact, whether it was Lu Chang Xang or Bay Yuya, their punches were light and not particularly painful, as they only had one child, Lu You.

After a beating, Lu Chang Ching would smile and say, "Do you know you're wrong, Lu You?" Lu You would respond, "Lu Chang Xang, I know. The weak cannot easily criticize the strong." Lu Chong Xen and Luu would look at each other, understanding the situation. Luu would quickly say, "I was joking. A beating would be nice, not mixed doubles."

Chapter 33: New Special Assignments

Bay Yuyo rubbed medicine on Luu's butt, saying, "This is the top of the healing medicine. You asked, and this small injury can be said to be a big thing." After rubbing the medicine, Luu would be able to recover to 7 or 8 in half an hour.

Bay Yuyo laughed, "Hey Luu, not complimenting you." Luu was infuriated, and Luu Yuya laughed in response. Her palm lifted, and with a snap, she slapped Luu's butt again. "Mom, you're still rubbing the medicine," Luu protested at this sneak attack that was not based on martial ethics. Bay Yuyo grunted, "Be honest, oh Luu. You heard what you said about your father, didn't you?"

Bay Yuya slowly said, "Things aren't as simple as you think. You'll know in the future. Your father has already done a good enough job." Luu lowered his head and didn't say anything.

Bay Yuya thought he was sulking, so she sighed and didn't continue talking. However, Luu wasn't sulking because a new Quest had actually been triggered on the light screen in front of him. "Special Assignment," it read. "You worked hard to gain the approval of the cabinet members, yet it was not that simple, and you knew how exaggerated the difficulty of it was. But you had no intention of giving up during this time. You learn a secret. A secret about your father, Lu Chang Ching's gradual demise. It turns out that your Marshall Sa father, who hasn't shown a smile for 30 years, isn't just because of you and that heavy burden on his body but there's another reason."

"Xiao when youan Xiao Wan you wan that was your father's brother, comrade in arms, and best friend. Yet he betrayed the human race and joined the alien Camp. Ever since the rise of the human race in the universe, it is not uncommon to see people betraying the human race. It can even be said that it is commonplace. However, there has never been a strong person of the Marshal Emperor realm, Jaia Wan Yuan's betrayal left Lu Changing in disbelief and for a time he fell into self-doubt. He kept tracking down the truth and realized that things weren't simple and that it didn't seem to be his intention, but no matter what, Jaia Wan Yuan had already betrayed, and there was no turning back."

"Please try to reach out to Cho man Yuan and get his approval. Mission reward: Nine Turn Soul Restoration Elixir." Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows when he saw this mission that had suddenly appeared. "What does the system mean? Is this because you don't think I'm busy enough? I can't believe I've been given a new assignment. This Quest reward though it's a bit of something. The nine revolutions pill, the name sounds like an Elixir that can bring the dead back to life if that's the case, it's a bull's eye."

"However, as early as a long time ago, Luu found out that the system gives these Rewards some bias towards the immortal side items. Basically, not in this world." Afterward, Luu carefully looked at the mission details and fell into deep thought. "If you put it in 40 years, this Mission would be absolutely menacing. Need to reach out to xia wuan who is in a foreign race. The risk factor can be enormous. But this wasn't 40 years later, and the xia wuan at this point in time hadn't betrayed the human community, so there was no risk at all. The difficulty of this task drops off all of a sudden. But, and here comes the problem, if it was true that xiaan Yuan was destined to betray the human race, then what should Lu you do to stop this from happening? Tell Dad luck Chun s directly, but that's the Intel from the system, and there might not even be a hint of what's going on right now. This is really not a good idea."

In that case, it seems that we can only take one step at a time. After thinking about it, Lu you looked up at mom, whom Bay Yuya glanced at him. "What's wrong? Do you know Xiao W youu?" Luu said, "How could you not recognize it? Bay Yuya, that's your father's good brother." Bay Yuya nodded, "So can you introduce me? I want to be friends with him."

Luu couldn't help but laugh out loud when he heard this. There was no way Luu was just too funny when he said this in his serious tone, he is the peak of a dignified Marshall Emperor, and back then, he was even just one step away from stepping into a marshall Saint. So what makes you friends with him?

BYU asked with a smile, "I'm not so bad, right?" Luu said rightfully, "My dad is a Marshall Saint, and since he's my dad's good brother, why haven't I ever seen him?" The reason is complicated, Bayu ya said thoughtfully, "He is sick and needs to recuperate. He's still not well." Luu asked, "The news from the outside world said that it had been well for a long time, but it had been externally claimed to be recuperating well, but not completely well." Bayu ya glanced at Luu and said, "Why are you asking this? You still really want to be friends with him?" Luu nodded vigorously, "Don't disturb people's rest." Bayu ya shook her head, seeing that it doesn't work on Mom's side. Luu didn't act unreasonably, anyway.

Later that night, at the banquet, Luu pulled in Xiao Jing, the son of Xiao. When Luu won, obviously Xiao Jing was much older than him, but at the moment, he was like a good little brother, sitting very obediently next to him. Luu wanted to spit out, "You are so well-behaved, I am afraid you will not fit in." However, on second thought, Jiao Jing's family situation was not good. His mother died early, and his father was sick since he was a child. He almost always played alone, and deep down, he should have longed for a friend. No need to be formal, Luu took Jia Jing's hand and asked with a smile, "Your father and my father are good brothers, you should know that, right? So, we should be good brothers too." Xiao Jing nodded, her voice like a mosquito, quiet as a girl. To be honest, Luu was tempted to pull out his crotch with one hand to see if this guy was a man or a woman. But considering that Xiao Jing's character was so soft, if she really came to this, she might give someone a social death and be so scared that she would never come back to the party again. And that wouldn't work as a boss. You still have to look like a boss. You still have to take care of your image.

The point is, the stage is still stuck. It is currently 68 out of 100. Progress is up a bit more, but it's still a fair way from being finished. Luu could only focus on tasks that were well accomplished. He looked at Xiao Jing and continued, "But then again, your father has been recuperating at home, and it's really not right that I, as a junior, haven't even gone to visit. I wonder if you can help me with an introduction so that I can go over and pay a visit." When Xiao Jing heard this, his face changed drastically, and his head shook like a rattle, "Don't, never! My dad, he, he likes to be quiet and doesn't like to be disturbed. So, you'd better not go over there. Really, I won't lie to you." Xiao Jing spoke hurriedly, his emotions getting a little agitated.

Chapter 34: Sword Dow Genius Lu. You also didn't realize that he was only asking to see his father, but Xiao Jing's emotions would be so agitated, and he was also extremely vocal in his opposition. Seeing this, Luu didn't continue to insist, smiled, and said, "In that case, it can't be helped." Xiao Jing couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief when he saw Luu give up. Then, he felt overwhelmed and hurriedly apologized, "Sorry." Luu shook his head, "It's fine." He wasn't an idiot. Seeing that Jia Jing actually reacted this way, he naturally guessed that what was going on here wasn't simple. Luu couldn't help but think that not long ago, Mom was also reluctant to bring herself to see Xiaw Yuan. Although at that time, Mom's emotions were not as agitated as Xiao Jing's, now that she thought about it carefully, she still detected that something was wrong. When you think about it, there's more to it than that. Since Jia Wuan was a good brother to his own father, and he hadn't seen him once since his own birth, even at the time of New Year's Eve, they didn't walk around each other. It definitely shouldn't be there's a lot of hidden agendas here. I'm afraid originally, Luu also felt that the newly triggered special mission could be considered very simple in comparison. He didn't realize it would be easy at all.

After the banquet is over, Luu made a communication call to Zonza. Not a moment too soon, Zonza's virtual image appeared in the room. He looked at Luu and asked with a smile, "Looking for me for something?" "Going to the cabinet tomorrow to listen to politics?" Luu shook his head and said, "It's not because of that. Although I do have to go listen to politics, the main purpose of the call is not that. I mainly want to ask you about Xia Wuan." When Zonza heard the name Xiao Wuan, he visibly froze. "Why are you asking about him?" Zonza looked at Luu and spoke with some misgivings, "I heard that he's my father's good brother, and it just so happens that I'm organizing a banquet these two days, and his son Xiao Jing is coming to attend. But I realize that I haven't seen this elder once, so it's inevitable that I'm a bit curious." Luu casually found a reason, "Master Sheru didn't say anything to you about him." Zonza said after thinking about it, "Just simply said something and didn't answer positively." Luu waved his hand, "Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to ask you. Since Master Sheru and Mother aren't even talking to you, it's even more important that I don't say anything." Zonza shook his head, "It's not." When Luu heard this, he was inevitably a bit dumbfounded, "How come?"

Each of them had become a riddler, you told me in secret, I won't tell anyone. No, you'd better ask Master Sheru about Elders, I don't dare to reveal it to you freely, Joon's tone was resolute before she hung up the communication.

Luu furrowed his tiny brows when he saw this. This matter seemed to be more complicated than he had initially thought. That night, Liu lay in Yuya's arms and slept, while Luu said, "Mom, tell me a story about when Dad was young."

Yuya had no reason to refuse, so she briefly spoke with Luu, but the direction of the story was not what Luu had thought. Yuya was telling the story of her and Lu Chang Shang's first acquaintance at Blue Star University, and how they had fallen in love at first sight.

As Luu listened, he didn't find it strange until Yuya said, "I remember when Dad was studying at Blue Star University, he was just 10 years old, right?" Lu Chang Shang had said this to her during his college years. In other words, no matter how many years Luu's father, Lu Chang Shang, had been in college, he had been a teenager at the time.

Luu looked at his old mom with consternation and asked, "Mom, how old were you when you were in college?"

Yuya was already weak-minded and didn't think much about Luu's question. She went along with the story and began to tell other stories. Inevitably, the name Xiao Wuan was mentioned.

Luu obediently asked, "Xiao Wuan isn't this the Elder who got sick and had to recuperate? Can you tell us about him?"

Yuya had a headache, trying to explain the situation to Luu. She said, "You should have heard of his reputation. Peak Marshall Emperor, Marshall Emperor, Grand Completion Halfstep Marshall Saint. Even your father has said that he has high hopes of achieving a Ten-Realm Marshall Saint."

By coincidence, Xiao Wuan was in their class at Blue Star University. Yuya continued, "Unlike your father, Jauan was a genius of the sword da. He was obsessed with the sword da since he was a child and even created the path of the sword and martial arts at the same realm. His sword da can be called invincible, and even your father can only avoid it."

Suddenly, Yuya stopped talking. Luu asked in a hurry, "What happened?"

Yuya shook her head and said, "I'm not too sure. Tell me briefly, Lu. You said blurrily, 'The Heavenly Pivot Starfield War' have you ever heard of it?"

Luu nodded, "Of course, I've heard of it. Everyone says that it was a crucial battle for the survival of the human community. It was during that battle that Dad managed to break through to the 10th realm and made a move to kill three extraterrestrial evil gods and managed to preserve the human community. Yes, that battle was quite thrilling. If it wasn't for that battle, I'm afraid that the human race would have already fallen to the evil God familiars."

Yuya nodded and continued, "Actually, Xiao Wuan was also in that battle. It was him who slowed down the attacking footsteps of the Extraterrestrial evil God and managed to buy some precious time before your father managed to break through to the 10th realm. His injuries also fell from that battle."

Luu pondered, "That's right."

Luu listened to the story but had some doubts in his heart. If that was all there was to it, then Joon definitely shouldn't have kept his mouth shut. Moreover, in the system's panel text, it was even mentioned that Xiao Wuan had betrayed the human race. The matter behind this was equally complicated.

Luu was keenly aware that something was wrong, but he understood that if he continued to ask, he would more than likely not be able to get any results. However, there was quite a bit of useful information in that speech. For example, Xiao Wuan was surprisingly a sword da genius. Since this was the case, it would be very simple to gain his approval. All one needed to do was to show his talent for the sword da earlier.

Of the many rewards that Luu had obtained, one of them was Innate Sword Intent. Since he was too young to officially practice martial arts, he had to put it on hold. He didn't realize it would come in handy for a follow-up mission. Luu inexplicably had a premonition. Could it be that when the system gave this reward of Innate Sword Intent, it was preparing him for this mission?

Due to this current quest, otherwise without any particular reason, what's the point of rewarding a born sword intent? Don't say it's still a possibility; it couldn't be that the system wanted Luo Wuan to be worshipped as a teacher. Yu Yao, observing Lou's pensive expression, inquired curiously, "What are you thinking about?" Lou contemplated, "I'm wondering if I should worship Xia Wanan as my master and inherit his mantle." Leng Yu slowly opened his mouth, asking, "Why do you want to worship him? Your father is a Marshall Saint." By Yu Yao was surprised and asked, "Once before, your father told me that the same path cannot lead to a second martial Saint." Luu explained, "So, if I want to practice martial arts in the future, it would be best if I don't follow his old path completely, or else I'll at most achieve Marshall Emperor and won't be able to break through to the limit of the nine Realms."

Yu Yao wanted to say, "Your kid hasn't even practiced martial arts yet, and you're already thinking about breaking through the limit of the ninth realm. Don't be too exaggerated." For an average martial artist, the Rift of cultivation lies in the sixth realm, and becoming a sixth realm patriarch would already be a generation of Masters. Breaking through the Marshall King is even more exceptional. Marshall Emperors, on the other hand, are a 100-foot pole, and few exist. Marshall Saints, for 2,000 years of the Star Marshall calendar, there was only one - Lu Chong Shen. Before the Star Marshall calendar, although there had been records of Marshall Saints appearing, the truthfulness of those records was questionable. Before the Star Marshall calendar, a six-realm patriarch was a party of greatness that could start a sect. Moreover, according to some scholars' research and investigation, the so-called martial Saints back then were most likely just the current Marshall King realm. In summary, the difficulty of breaking through to Marshall Saint was nothing short of exaggerated to the extreme.

However, since her son was so confident, Yu Yao didn't want to speak against him. Luo continued to say to himself, "Since Uncle Xiao is no longer able to break through to the 10th realm, if I can inherit his mantle and succeed in breaking through to the 10th realm, he should be very pleased as well, right?" Yu Yao couldn't help but remark, "Your kid is really confident. Cultivation is hard; don't be blindly proud and arrogant." Although By Yu Yao couldn't bear to shatter her son's confidence, she didn't want him to be proud and arrogant. Luo nodded, acknowledging that he knew cultivation was difficult. If it weren't, he wouldn't have reached the fourth Realm of martial arts by the age of 40. However, now he had the Da Embryo Dan, the transformed foundation of his body, innate sword intent, the power of the dragon and tiger, an unforgettable Vision that was higher than most people's starting points, and realm-breaking pills, J Gua dragon and tiger golden pills, and other helpers. If this wasn't enough to be confident, Luo wouldn't even consider cultivating.

Upon hearing this, Yu Yao glanced at Luo's little face again and saw that he was still so confident. She thought for a moment and said, "Even though you can't cultivate right now, I'll take you to a place so that you can see the world and understand that the path of cultivation in this world isn't as simple as you think it is." Luo's eyes lit up, eagerly asking, "What place?" Yu Yao smiled and replied, "You'll know when we get there." Subsequently, By Yu Ya led Luo to the backyard cultivation field of the Marshall Saints' residence. Further inside, there was a loft with a huge footprint. The loft had an old-fashioned plaque with three large letters: Manfa House. By Yu Ya held Luo's hand and explained, "This is where your father collected the great summer martial arts after achieving the Marshall Saint realm. At the realm of the Marshall Saint, he returned to the basics, blending all the martial arts of all the greats, removing the wheat from the chaff, and leaving his own insights recorded in this 10,000 laws building."

Luo was surprised as he listened to Yu Yao's introduction. He hadn't realized there was such a powerful place in their house that he had never been to. It wasn't entirely his fault, as the Marshall Saint residence was just so vast. If not for Yu Yao bringing him here, Luo wouldn't have been able to walk here in half a day. With a nod, Luo followed Yu Yao into the Manfa House. Yu Yao pushed open the heavy door, and as Luo's small feet landed, he felt a fluctuation in the surrounding space. Looking around, Luo realized they had arrived in a marvelous space. The sky was made up of countless densely written words that spread from the top of his head to the limit of his vision. There were also tens of thousands of volumes of martial arts books floating around, presented in various forms - some consisting of mere words, while others were in the form of pictures or images.

Some were simply composed of sounds, and even more were just a single sword mark. Mark had an ineffable Dao in it; it was clearly just a sword mark. But the amount of information was so much that it made one's scalp numb, and just by looking at it, one would want to sit on the ground to properly comprehend it. Luu swept through it with a single glance, and an exact number suddenly appeared in his mind: 98,000 volumes.
"Are these the handiwork of the Father?" Luu originally did not have a visualized concept of the realm of Martial Saint. It was only after seeing this terrifying number of martial arts that he had glimpsed the tip of the iceberg of Martial Saints.
Is this the sage of martial arts? Before Lu Chang Xang broke through the 10th realm, for a long time, people agreed that the ninth realm was the limit. Nine is the extreme of numbers; it is both young and extreme. The height of the heavens is the nine heavens, and the extremity of the Earth is the nine Springs. The limit of martial arts naturally also had nine Realms. After the ninth realm, there was no longer a path. Yet, Lu Chang Xang never believed in this. As a result, he really let him break through the limit of the nine Realms and walk out of the path of the 10 realms.
Just then, Luu felt a repulsive force, and he had this feeling that he would be kicked out of this marvelous space if he didn't proceed to Enlightenment. How can this be? We've come all this way.
Chapter 36: Marshall Saint means "need to achieve." When you won, Luu looked toward the sword mark among these 98,000 volumes of martial arts. This sword mark was the only one that touched him the most deeply. Just a brief look at it makes you want to sit on the floor and take in the experience.
Luu, you didn't hesitate and directly sat down on the spot to realize the Dao contained in this sword mark. Although his old dad, Lu Chong Shung, had said that he could not become a second Marshall Saint by following his path, it didn't mean that Luu couldn't comprehend his martial arts. Luu was naturally clear about the reasoning behind choking you. You can't stop taking in Pop's martial arts path just because you can't follow the same path.
Can you? How to achieve Marshall sainthood was not something that needed to be considered until one reached at least the Martial Emperor realm. Luu hadn't even stepped onto the path of martial arts cultivation yet. Thinking about how to break through to Marshall Saint now is really ridiculous. And as the saying goes, "the blue is better than the blue." He was perfectly capable of comprehending these martial arts and stepping out on his own path.
Inside the Manifestation Building, by Yuya looked down at Luu, who was in the middle of his Enlightenment, and couldn't help but open her mouth. Not what? She had brought Luu over just to show him the world and let him know the depths of the martial arts. Not for Luu to come over and participate in the Enlightenment.
Generally speaking, it was impossible for a child as old as Luu to comprehend the martial arts. The depth of the martial way was so profound that it was rare for a martial artist before the fifth realm to be able to penetrate into it, even a little bit. Let alone a kid who hasn't even started cultivating yet. You didn't learn to walk, and you just flew. It's just not scientific.
On the path of Marshall cultivation, the first realm practiced skin and flesh. The second realm forged sinews and bones. The Third Realm refined the organs. The fourth realm replaced the blood. The fifth realm forged the golden body, and only at this stage did he begin to comprehend the Marshall way, condensing into the Dharma phase and breaking through to the sixth realm.
In other words, the Marshall Dao in this 10,000 Laws Building was barely accessible until one reached at least the fifth realm. However, Luu even directly skipped the stage of physical cultivation and directly began to participate in Enlightenment. Although Bay Yuya also knew that her own son was a genius, she still didn't expect that he would be a genius to this extent.
For a Moment, by Yuya didn't know if this was good or bad because Luu had entered a state of Enlightenment. By Yuya dared not disturb him, even more casually.
BYU Yo thought about it and called Lu Chang Shang over. Lu Chang Xang was still busy, but when he heard that his son was in the 10,000 Laws Building for enlightenment, he was shocked and directly rushed back in a hurry.
How long has he been in Enlightenment? Lu Chang Xing stared at Luu and hurriedly asked.
"28 minutes," by Yuya said.
This made Lu Chang Xang furrow his brows. Then, he also sat down on his knees and entered the space of Enlightenment. This 10,000 Dharma Building, each person who came in for enlightenment had a separate space. However, this was no big deal to Lu Chong Xang, who was the creator, and naturally opened the back door to enter other people's Enlightenment spaces at will.
After Lu Chang Xang entered Luu's Marshall Space, he immediately felt the sharp sword intent on him. He looked up, only to see a stone tablet hovering above Luu's head. There was no writing on that stone tablet, only a sword mark. As Luu continued to comprehend the sword marks on that stone tablet became fainter and fainter. Seeing this scene, Lu Ching's face was a bit complicated.
I really didn't expect that little Luu was actually a sword Dao seedling. After another moment, Luu slowly opened his eyes. The sword Aura in his eyes.

It was almost impossible to hide the fact that the person's temperament had changed significantly, as if a newly sharpened sword had been drawn. This enlightening experience was rewarding for the majority of the hour. The Sword in Intent, the sword that Mark made, had greatly expanded Luu's understanding of the sword path, an unknown amount. Suddenly, he was startled to find his old man beside him. "Why are you here?" he naturally asked.

Lu Chang Xing glanced at Luu, then waved his hand. "Don't continue to enlighten. This sword, Mark, is enough for you to digest for a long time. If you continue, you'll hurt your spirit in just half an hour." Luu's speed of understanding the sword path was almost as fast as a rocket, and this constant enlightening experience truly made people want to stop after the enlightenment. After the enlightenment, Luu subconsciously wanted to enlighten other martial arts. Hearing his dad say this, Luu decisively gave up and continued to enlighten his own father, who could not possibly harm himself.

When Luu exited this space and returned to the 10,000 Laws Building, Yu Yao hurriedly asked, "What did you comprehend about the Sword Dow Stone Tablet?" Lu Chang Xing said, "Ha, Bayu Yya was a bit surprised when she heard this. It's actually the Sword Dow Stone Tablet. This kid really does have a talent for the sword." "Da, yeah, what's wrong?" Lu Chang Xing asked a little strangely. "By Yuyo briefly repeated what Luu had said earlier, then said with emotion, 'I didn't expect that he's really a genius of the sword. Why don't we let him worship Xian Yuan as his teacher so that he can have an inheritance for his mantle? Even if a child says such things, do you really think that a Marshal Saint is that good? It's still unknown if he can achieve Marshal Saint that way.'" Lu Chang Xing slowly shook his head, then smiled and said, "But then again, I haven't seen him for a while. I'm afraid he still doesn't know that this son of mine is a genius, right, or an absolute genius of the sword." "Da, you're going to go show off in front of him," Bayu Yya was a bit speechless. "He's still recuperating. Is it really okay for you to stimulate him like this?" "What's wrong with that?" Lu Chang Xing grinned and directly grabbed Luu, his footsteps gently stepping forward. Luu didn't feel the flying movement; just a blink of an eye, and he had changed places. The architectural style of this side of the house was markedly different from his own, and it seemed extremely cold. "Here," Lu Chang Xing put down Luu. "This is instantaneous transfer." Luu was stunned. His old man had just taken him one step forward and came directly to the side. This kind of means was truly astonishing. Is this the means of a Marshal Saint? Lu Chang Xing nodded slightly, then looked up and said, "Brother, when you have an old friend here and you don't come out to greet him." As the words fell, the door slowly pulled open, and a slim man dressed in white slowly walked out. The white-clothed man's waist was straight, and his entire body seemed like a sharp sword. However, Luu could clearly feel that the aura of his body was a bit dark, like a sharp sword rusting. "I don't know what the Marshal Sage Lou is doing here in person," Jaan Yuan said with an expressionless face. "Naturally, there is a reason here. This is my son, Luu." Lu Chang Xing touched Luu's head and introduced him. "He just turned three this year, and I haven't brought him to meet you yet. So I'll bring him to meet the elders when Xian Yuan hears this, he subconsciously glanced at Luu. He could clearly feel the sharp sword intent on Luu. "Xian Yuan, you just said how old he is," Chapter 37, Born with a Sword Heart. Lu Chang Xing watched Jaan Yuan's face and showed his teeth. "Three years old, strictly speaking, this is an imaginary age. To be precise, he's one year and eight or nine months old. I hadn't thought to bring him into you. As a result, tonight he went to play at my 10,000 Laws Building and accidentally enlisted that Sword Dow Stone Tablet of yours. So I thought that since he hadn't seen you once either, I'd bring him over to see you. How's that for a good catch, Xiao One? You're showing off, isn't it? This must be showing off, right? It's showing off no matter how you look at it. Compared to the incompetent son of his own family, Luu in front of him had really almost pissed him off. That Sword Dow Stone Tablet, even though I carved it with my own hands, it's really not easy for a young child to comprehend. Xiao Wuan slowly said. At the same time, a line of text appeared on the light screen in front of Luu: Mission completed. You have successfully gained Xian Yuan's approval. The reward item, Nine Revolutions of the Soul, has been released. Nine turns of Soul Restoration Pill, rank seventh quality, perfect type. Consumable effects: After taking it in the next 24 hours, if the body suffers irreversible damage, the effects of this Elixir will be triggered as a priority, thus reversing the Yin and Yang, returning the soul to life, and repairing all the damages. Description: A magical Elixir made by a great power from ancient times. It is worth noting that if a person who is already dead

After eating this Elixir again, it will have no effect. It should also be noted that this Elixir is of low grade and has a very limited range of effects. Luu glanced at the introduction of the Nine Revolutions Soul Restoration Pill. The stuff was undoubtedly good, but a little different than he had initially thought. He had thought the Nine Revolutions Soul Restoration Pill was the kind that could resurrect the dead when eaten, but this one given by the system is clearly not. You need to take it in advance and then take damage within 24 hours to trigger the effect. That means if you don't get fatally injured within 24 hours, the potion is wasted. It always feels a bit chicken, however, at least it's one more way to save your life. It's not bad; it's better than nothing.

Just as Luu was thinking this, the system quest triggered again. "Special Mission Triggered: You have gone out of your way to finally meet Jia Wuan and managed to gain his approval. However, this is only the first step. Next, please become his disciple and bring him back to the human race."

**Stage 1 Mission: Become his disciple.**
**Quest Reward: Born with the Sword in Mind.**

**Stage 2 Mission: Bring Cho Manam back to the human race.**
**Mission Reward: Natural Ability Sword Da Tongin.**

Luu looked at the mission that flashed by and couldn't help but let his eyes light up. If you look at it from a systemic point of view, 40 years later, Jia Wuan rebelled against the human race. In such a situation, wanting to become his disciple, the difficulty that was naturally not generally exaggerated, and the risk factor is extremely high. Once the others found out, the consequences were unimaginable. Furthermore, bringing him back to the human community would be even more ridiculously difficult. The decision of a peak Martial Emperor, ah, how could it be easily changed? So this special mission is pretty much the equivalent of a side mission. It's way too difficult with relatively not that high of a payoff and a tremendous amount of risk. But for the current Luu, there is no risk. It's almost like a reward for nothing. Cool to feel that way.

Lu Changxiang glanced at Luu and said smugly, "That's natural. He's my son. Brother, what kind of thing is it to talk outside the house? Why don't you introduce us inside? It was me who was rude." Xuan came back to his senses and hurriedly welcomed Lu Changxiang in.

In the ensuing chat, Lu Changxiang pressed the matter of worshipping the master, just to whet Jia Wuan's appetite. In the end, it was Xiao Wuan who couldn't help himself. "This kid and I are kindred spirits. Why don't we let him worship me as his teacher? And it's good to have someone to inherit those sword and martial arts ways of mind."

When Li Changxiang heard this, he laughed lightly and said, "Don't I want someone to inherit this mantle of Martial Saint?"

Jia Wuan looked at Luu and said without lifting his head, "You can't get two Martial Saints out of one road. It's not like you don't know."

When Li Changxiang heard this, he let out a sigh and said, "Since brother Wuan has said so, then I can only reluctantly agree. It's obviously a bargain, but it's like selling a favor."

Jia Wuan also ignored him and touched Luu's head softly, saying, "Come over to me when you have time in the future, and I will tell you what is the way of the sword in martial arts."

Luu blinked and hastily shouted, "Master!"

Jia Wuan was first stunned, then he couldn't help but glance at Lu Changxiang and said with a smile, "Your son even knows better than you."

Lu Changxiang hummed but didn't say anything more.

"Good, since you called me master, from now on I am your master," Jia Wuan looked at Luu and nodded. "I'll pour my heart out and teach you the true solution to the Sword Da."

At this moment, the system panel in front of Luu's eyes suddenly appeared with a prompt: "Phase one of the mission has been completed. Mission rewards have been issued: Born with the Sword in Mind."

In an instant, the many unanswered questions from previous references to the Sword Da Stone tablet were resolved. So that's how it is. There was no doubt that with this reward being handed out, Luu's originally even formidable Sword Da talent became even more astonishing and heaven-defying. The mysteries of it...

While looking up at Lu Changxiang and asked without moving, "I'm not 3 years old yet, isn't it true that I can't cultivate? What can't be carried out is just martial arts cultivation. What does it have to do with this Sword Da of mine?"

Jia Wuan said carelessly, "Ah..."

Luu was a little confused and only then did he react to why his father had specially brought himself over. It turned out that the path of sword and martial arts could be practiced in advance. When you think about it, it makes sense. The way of the sword is it not such an inconvenience? It's just that if you're practicing the way of the sword, you're already strapped for time, and that's going to be even more strained. Got to get organized to do that. The cabinet side, which is considered the main mission, should never be abandoned. The evening's Heroes assembly, although it was a side quest, had reached a critical juncture, and there was even less reason to give it up. Thinking about it, I can only condescend to Mister Look Wang Thai. Although Mister Li Guang Tai's lectures were witty and...

Luu had become enlightened to the workings of the world, and he realized that it was better to focus on cultivation rather than relying on systematic self-study. After all, in this star martial age, cultivation came first. He had missed out on cultivating due to his youthful age, but now that he had the opportunity to do so, he was excited to take it up. Chapter 38: The Path of the Sword

Jao Jing looked at Luu blankly. He remembered how Luu had suggested visiting the Shen Residence after the afternoon banquet, and he had hastily declined, mainly because he was worried about his temperamental father not taking a liking to Luu and causing a scene. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, Luu had become his father's personal disciple? His treatment was much more cordial than how he treated his own biological son, Xiao Jing was inexplicably a little heartbroken. In fact, it was no wonder that Jago Yuan was biased towards Luu; Luu's talent was simply too amazing. When Luu called out the word "Master," Jago Yuan couldn't resist the itch and gave him some guidance. The result was predictable for Luu, who had just obtained the core teachings of the Sword Mind; it was almost child's play. This was like taking a high school exam and the question turned out to be 3+4 equals; it was so simple that Luu could do it with ease. A few introductory techniques, and Luu had mastered them. Jago Yuan was initially taken aback by Luu's talent and didn't comprehend just how good Luu was. If his own untalented son was to learn, it would take at least 10 days and a half months or even longer. So, Jago Yuan increased the difficulty level, but to Luu, it was still not a problem. Jago Yuan was somewhat unable to calm down and continued to increase the difficulty, but Luu didn't show any signs of struggle. At this point, even the disciples of the Higher Realm Sankara were surprised at Luu's power.

Luu was really a prodigy, and it seemed that he might inherit Jago Yuan's master mantle and surpass him by achieving a new 10th Realm Saint. However, this was still too far away, and the thought was just a flicker. Jago Yuan continued to teach Luu from the Sword Momentum to the Sword Intention and then the Sword Heart. Luu didn't feel the slightest bottleneck; he was like a piece of diamond, and with a little bit of polishing, he could become a fine weapon.

Jago Yuan stroked his palm, grinning. Wonderful, born with a clear Sword Heart, this kind of Sword Dew seedling was unique in the world. It seems that my Sword and Martial Arts mantle can finally be passed on. It was basically hopeless for him to break through the 10th Realm in this life, but if he could pass on the mantle, it could be more important than anything else. He would be content to see a personal disciple follow in his own path and succeed in achieving a Sword Saint. If he was going to die soon, he could close his eyes in peace, knowing that his legacy was in good hands.

Unfortunately, the path of the Sword and Martial Arts has extremely high requirements for disciples; it's not easy to find a worthy successor. Jago Yuan had searched for a long time before finding someone, and even then, his heart was still hesitant. Who would have guessed that stepping through the iron shoes and finding the right place wouldn't be an easy task?

Xiao Jing couldn't help but lament, "Luu, you've broken through to Marshall Saint level; how did you produce a son that's also so powerful? God is so unfair."

With Jago Yuan's guidance, Luu formally embarked on the path of Sword and Marial Arts. Similar to martial artists, the first step was all about tempering the physical body. The regular process of practicing the skin and flesh in the first realm, forging the sinews and bones in the second realm, and refining the organs in the third realm was omitted. When the Sword and Martial Arts reached a small level of success, they would directly reach the fourth realm - a shortcut, not a shortcut at all. The entire process of tempering the body in the way of the Sword and Martial Arts was even more tedious than that of a martial artist, and the requirements for cultivation were even higher. So, if one did not have the talent, one would not be able to cultivate at all. The good thing is that Luu had talent and the system had helped to turn it on. Luu is not lacking at all; only cultivation is ultimately a grind, and even with talent, it's impossible to cultivate to the fourth realm in a short period of time. Rice has to be eaten grain by grain; Kung Fu has to be practiced day by day.

Let's set a small goal first: within a year, breakthrough to the fourth realm. Luu thought this way and looked at the system panel again.

Our mission is to bring Cho Manam back to the human race. Quest reward: natural ability, sword Da Tong. This mission requires us to figure out how to accomplish it. Should we let Jaia fake his defection first and then persuade him to come back? Or shouldn't we? Maybe we need to find out the truth about Ja's defection and cut it off early, so he breaks the idea of rebellion and our mission is considered complete. I have to say, it's quite possible that Ja's betrayal was not as simple as it seems on the system panel. It says here that Ja's betrayal left Lu Chang in disbelief, and for a time, he fell into self-doubt. He kept tracking down the truth and realized it was not that simple, and his intention was not clear. But no matter what, Jaia has already betrayed us, and there's no turning back. So, what led to this incident? The system doesn't give a clue, not even a timeline of when it happened. Lu didn't dare to beat around the bush and could only investigate slowly. The coming days were long, and that night, while sleeping, Lu told Yuyo about his worship. Mom, it's a pity you didn't see it at that time. Xia Wuan saw my talent and sword Da Tong; it was so powerful that he was directly shocked. His face was so wonderful. He never dreamed that in this world, there are actually such powerful people. Can't be helped. He hastened to beg my dad for me to inherit his mantle, saying that he would definitely be able to break through to the 10th realm in the future and become a Sword Saint in the future. Once I become a Sword Saint, my battle prowess will definitely be even greater than dad's. But I think the title of Sword Saint is a bit too common. I feel it's a bit rotten. We need to replace it with a good one. What do you think about calling it Sword God or Sword Immortal? What do you think, Mom? Is it better to be a Sword God or a Sword Fairy? By Ud's face, twist as she listened to her own son's incessant bragging. You'd better go to bed for me. Lu suddenly remembered something. Right, Mom. Since I'm going to follow Xia Wuan and practice the way of the sword in martial arts, there's no way I can study liberal arts with Teacherly. There simply isn't enough time. How is it not enough? Wouldn't it be fine for you to study liberal arts in the morning, and the way of the sword and martial arts in the afternoon? BYU Yao glanced at Lu. I still have to go to the cabinet to listen to politics. Lu shook his head. Just don't go. Yuyu said, "That won't do." Lu said with a firm gaze, "The reason I cultivate is to clarify the Jade, change the heavens, and lead the human race to Greatness again." When Lu said this, the expression on his little face was extraordinarily serious. BYU Yao only felt a little amused. "What can you learn in the cabinet?" Yuyu asked. "There's so much to learn," Lu said briefly. He promised to keep it a secret, but he didn't say anything specific. Just to give an example of two parties arguing over interests, each side having its own arguments and both sides having their own reasons, and in the end, the executive officer can only make peace and let each side take a step back. This incident has made me realize that looking at things from a different standpoint gives you a completely different result. Asses make heads. These words were very vulgar, and BYU Yao frowned slightly, but after chewing carefully, she realized the true meaning of these words: whichever way your ass sits, that's how your head thinks; position determines thought. Lu, despite his youthful age, actually understood such reasoning. It seems that this cabinet is not just about observing politics but also some role by BYU Yao looked at Lu with surprise. Who told you this? I comprehended it myself. Lu said, "Your words are a bit vulgar, but there's some truth to them. It seems like you've really learned something from watching politics in the cabinet." BYU Yao thought about it and said, "In that case, the matter of learning literature has to wait until you grow up a little. Tomorrow morning, I'll tell Mister Lie what you mean, and you'll say goodbye to him." I had thought it would take at least two or three years for Enlightenment but didn't realize it was just a month or so before I had to dismiss people. I'm a little embarrassed. Lu sighed, "It can't be helped. Who made me a genius?" BYU Ya glanced at the smelly brat, as much as it was tempting to retort. Lu nodded. He knew he owed his natural talent to his own hard work and a little extra effort. By Yuyu's words, what Lu had learned in the cabinet was much more than just that. He also learned how to buy people's hearts and minds, how to shrug it off and still make his men think it was his fault; the essence of making peace; and there's the idea of not being bound by rules but limiting others with them. The most important point is that Lu understood the art of politics is the art of trade-offs rather.

In a seemingly similar situation, the two parties are worlds apart in reality. Balancing the interests of all parties, he holds the absolute power to speak, with the authority to both live and kill. However, it is not advisable to utter such words, lest Yuya perceives it as a bad lesson and the consequences would be dire if he is denied access to the cabinet. Despite his young age, he is already contemplating life and death, manipulating hearts, and bending rules, which is too advanced for his years.

Luu, gradually growing drowsy, was reminded of something. He roused himself, fighting against the sleepiness, and looked up, saying, "Mom, you need to prepare some worship gifts for Master Worship Baudo. Although Uncle Xiao has been recognized as my master, the gift of worship has not been bestowed upon him. This cannot be overlooked."

Yuya, surprised, responded, "Whether Master is present or not, and whether to send a gift of worship or not, is my concern. Sending it is not mandatory."

Luu, unable to resist sleepiness any longer, closed his eyes and dozed off. Yuya, initially planning to praise Luu, was left speechless upon seeing him fall asleep.

Later, Lu Chang Shang returned from work and glanced at Luu, asleep. He asked in a low voice, "Fell asleep?" Yuya nodded, "What did Xia Wuan say so quickly to accept a disciple? Our son is a prodigy of the sword. He begged me almost kneeling down, and I reluctantly agreed when I saw how pitiful he was, with no one to inherit the mantle at his age."

Lu Chang Shang smiled, "By Yuya, seeing your speechless expression, Lu Chang Chang asked somewhat strangely, why do you have this expression?" Yuya smiled, "You too, ah, you're really worthy of being father and son, even the words you say are the same."

Hearing this, Lu Chang Shang asked with some curiosity, "What did this kid say?" Yuya then repeated it to Lu Chang Shang. After Lu Chang Shang heard this, he was a bit speechless. "This kid can even surpass me. It's not even a case of like father like son anymore, it's a case of blue is better than blue."

Yuya glanced at Luu, who was sleeping, and then looked up at Lu Chang Shang, "What's going on? Although there was some exaggeration in what he said, overall, it's not too far off."

Lu Chang Shang said after some thought, "Ha, by Yuya, frozen for a moment, and said with some disbelief, he's bragging that he's the next Saint, and it's still a big difference. There is a certain hope."

Lu Chang Shang slowly said, "At least from the point of view of natural Talent, it is almost impeccable, but to break through the T realm, only natural Talent is not enough."

Yuya opened her mouth in some surprise when she heard this, "His sword Dao Talent is so powerful. Just attending to a sword Dao Stone tablet shouldn't be enough, right?"

Lu Chang Chong continued, "I don't know much about the way of the sword, but brother Wuan said that he was born with a clear sword heart. When brother Wuan arrived at this realm at the age of 24, he was already a demon to the extreme, and he is no longer good enough to use the demon two words to describe it. As long as brother Wuan guides him carefully and allows Luu to inherit the mantle, achieving the ninth realm in the future shouldn't be too much of a problem. As for the 10th realm, this has nothing to do with natural Talent. The most group of our human beings is the least lacking is the natural Talent, vertical and horizontal people. But unfortunately, arriving at the 10th Realm of the people, there is only one. Listening to Lu Ching's emotional tone, Yuya couldn't help but glance at him in surprise. "That one person you're talking about isn't that you? That's fine to say from the sidelines, but it's a little weird if it's coming from me."

Yuya, knowing what Lu Chang Chang wanted to hear, spoke, "It's still you who's great." Lu Chang Chang smiled and stroked Yuya's long hair. "He's not that bad. That's right, he also asked me to prepare a master worship ceremony."

Yuya thought about it and hurriedly opened her mouth, "A gift of worship, I've already prepared it." Lu Chang xang nodded, but he had a heart turning to the next day.

Luu said goodbye to his teacher Liwang Taii. Although reluctant, he had to put more energy into cultivation and temporarily set aside the liberal arts knowledge content. After Li Guang Tai heard this news, he did not make things difficult for Yuya and smiled as he made his farewell with Luu. Then, Lu Chang took the master worship gift and went to Xia Wuan's house again. Luu's teacher worship gift was not expensive, only 10 dried meats of foreign beasts. This world also had the gift of tuition, but Lu You looked at the 10 dried meats carefully but felt that it wasn't that expensive.

Simple Dad, what kind of exotic beast's meat is this? This is the meat of a ninth-ranked foreign Beast, Lu Changxing smiled faintly. "That mountain-sized F Beast Emperor only produced these ten strips of not-so-bad meat. A ninth-order Fay, it was indeed worthy of the handiwork of the Marshall Saint," Lu couldn't help but swallow his saliva. "Don't steal food your body can't handle," Lu Changxing admonished Lu. Lu himself felt despised. "Really, am I that kind of person?" But how did Dad know what he was thinking? Does the Marshall Saint still have this ability?

Looking at Lu's expression, Lu Changxing couldn't help but want to laugh as he shook his head and spoke, "Come over here. I'll verify it for you so that you can gain access to this spaceship." Lu's eyes lit up when he heard this, and he excitedly hugged Lu Changxing's thigh. "Dad is going to give me this S-Class ship. Thank you, Daddy. You're so nice. You're the best dad in the world."

Lu Changxing glanced at Lu, who was clinging to his thighs with a death grip. "Who said I was going to give you this ship? I'm just asking you to verify it and gain access." Lu, you said rightfully, "Of course not. This is for the purpose of sending you to your Master's side to train afterward." What a beautiful thought. "How old are you, and you want an S-Class ship or this Polaris ship of mine?" Lu Changxing said with a speechless face. In that case, Lu lowered his head perfectly, interpreting what it meant to hang his head in shame. Seeing Lu like this, Lu Changxing felt inexplicably a bit guilty. He thought for a moment and said, "Didn't I tell you before? If you break through to the sixth realm before you turn 18, I'll give you this Airship."

With Ja and Yuan's devotion to teaching him, it's still a handful. Lu's eyes lit up, and he raised his head again, all without a trace of the sadness he had just felt. "That's natural," Lu Changxing couldn't help but want to laugh when he saw that Lu's little face was changing faster than turning a book chapter.

Chapter 40: Sword Pool. Xiaan Yuan's face was subtle as he looked at the information in front of him. Since he had decided to take Lu as his personal disciple, it was very necessary to know everything about this disciple. So then, Jaia Wuan used his connections a little bit, and then he saw these in front of him. After just a brief sweep, Jaia Wuan couldn't remain calm. The content of the intelligence written on it made him doubt the authenticity for a moment.

A child of only three years old, by virtue of his own identity advantage, enlisted the direct descendant of various martial arts Kings and Emperors to become their own little brother and organized a circle called the Great Summer Heroes. Nowadays, this circle in the high-level circle of Blue Star can be said to be famous, especially in the circle of those powerful children. But also, no one knows, and no one knows a lot of kids squeeze through and don't get in the loop. This was because their requirements were high, either they had a prominent family lineage with a Marshall King, Marshall Emperor, old man, or they were gifted and talented with a great talent in order to be qualified to join in. Those other cats and dogs don't even think about it.

It was worth mentioning that even his son, Xiao Jing, was pulled into the circle and became Lu Jr. Seeing this, Xia Wuan's face twitched, then continued to read on. In addition to organizing the circle of Dasha Heroes, Lu also entered the Dasha cabinet to listen to politics. Cabinet listening to politics. When Xia Wuan saw these words, he thought he had misread them, and his expression was a bit taught. He really couldn't connect Lu, a three-year-old child, with the cabinet hearing. No, this kid, Li Chongxong, is this how he teaches children? He's only three years old, and you're letting him go to the cabinet.

There was also a New Year's message published once. Let's see. Xiao Wuan clicked on the video, then he saw it. The New Year's message that Lu had delivered in the first place, facing the camera, facing the audience of the 688 living planets of Dashia, Lu did not feel the slightest bit of restraint or nervousness in this New Year's greeting. Lu, the only son of the Marshall Sage, perfectly displayed himself and gained a superb reputation and popularity in the entire Granda. This part of the intelligence without having to deliberately collect it could be said to be known by everyone. It was just that the previous Jaia Wuan, who didn't ask about the world, so he didn't know about it.

When he finished reading the information, Jaia Wuan couldn't help but rub his brows. "That's really something to look into." Briefly met last night, thought it was a well-behaved disciple. Didn't think, really didn't think. Yes, with Lu Changxing's crazy troublemaking personality, how could he give birth to well-behaved children? But by the time Lu Changxing brought Lu here, the expression on Jawan Yuan's face had already returned to its previous indifference, and not the slightest difference could be seen.

After delivering the gift of tuition and performing the ritual of paying homage to his master, Lu officially became Jaan Yuan's disciple. "Master, what do I start cultivating today? Is it to quench my body or to learn sword techniques?" Lu hurriedly opened his mouth and asked. "None of that is necessary. Follow me to the sword pool."

In the backyard, Xiao Wuan shook his head and pointed to a steaming body of water. “That’s the sword pool,” he said indifferently.

Luu was a bit curious and followed Xiao Wuan to the backyard of the mansion. From a distance, they could see a natural hot spring, with a constantly steaming mist. As they got closer, they could see a stone tablet with two words written on it: “Sword Pond.”

When Luu saw this, he thought to himself with some surprise, “The so-called sword pool—does it refer to the hot springs here?” He didn’t say anything, however, and continued to follow Xiao Wuan.

Entering a pavilion, Luu could feel the geothermal heat and the temperature had risen significantly. It was still cold in the springtime, but over here, because of the geothermal heat, Luu couldn’t feel a bit of cold.

Under Jaia’s leadership, Luu took off his clothes, put on a bath towel, and walked out of the pavilion. Not far away, Jaia Xiao Jing was taking a dip in a ruddy pool, his expression pained and his forehead sweating coldly.

After hearing the sound, Jaia Xiao Jing looked up and saw Luu. “Big brother, you’re here,” he said, enduring the pain.

Luu greeted him, and Xiao Jing said, “If you can’t endure it, get out.” Xiao Wuan glanced at Xiao Jing and said indifferently, “You go and soak in the lavender pool.”

Luu raised his head and asked with some curiosity, “Master, is this a special pool?”

Xiao Wuan nodded and patiently explained, “This is a sword pool that I personally formulated. The water in it can effectively stimulate the flesh and accelerate the speed of body hardening. You come over to my side every day and take a bath. When you can’t stand it, just come out. When you come out, take a little rest and then cultivate the way of the sword and martial arts. You’ll get twice the result with half the effort. Once you’re in there, hang in there as long as you can and don’t let a little pain hold you back. In the way of the sword and martial arts, the most important thing is not only the supreme natural talent but also the will to go forward. Generally speaking, you need to soak for at least 5 minutes to have an effect and stick with it for up to 10 minutes to have a noticeable effect. 15 minutes onwards, the effect will get better and better. If you can soak for more than half an hour, your future cultivation will be much much faster.”

Luu listened to Xiao Wuan and couldn’t help but ask, “In other words, the longer you soak, the better it is? You can’t say that everything has a degree. This is no exception. You’re still young now, and you’ve only just started cultivating. Even if you can hold on for the whole time, it’s best not to exceed an hour.”

Xiao Wuan thought for a moment and said, “Generally speaking, trying to soak for an hour right off the bat is basically impossible. It has nothing to do with natural talent.”

Luu nodded and turned his head to look at the lavender pool water, wondering in his heart just how long he could last. He took one step at a time and soon arrived next to the lavender pool. He touched the water with his foot—the temperature was just right. But the moment he touched it, his toes tingled, and a tingling sensation came over him.

“This pool can’t be leaking, right?” Luu muttered to himself. No wonder Xiao Jing could barely stand it after only 10 minutes of soaking.

Luu gritted his teeth and jumped directly into the pool. When Xiao Wuan saw this scene, the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but reveal a faint smile. The normal step is to let your body slowly adjust to the pain before taking a step into the pool. Jumping right in as soon as you’re up here is being as adventurous as the Xiao Jing kid. It’s a wonder it doesn’t hurt you. However, it is good to let this Luu suffer a little bit so that he understands that it is not easy to cultivate.

However, the next scene made Xiao Wuan a bit dumbfounded. The moment Luu jumped down into the pool, endless stinging pain came like a tidal wave as the pain spread throughout his body. Luu realized his rashness, but just at the moment when that endless pain struck within Luu’s body, the Dragon Tiger golden Dan, which had not yet been digested, was as if it had been stimulated and started to rotate immediately.

A dim golden light spread out from the Dragon Tiger golden pill, quickly spreading to Luu’s entire body. The pain that was like a tidal wave could no longer be feared under the golden light of the Dragon Tiger golden elixir. Almost the vast majority of the pain was banished, and what little irritation remained was nothing at all.

The most marvelous thing was that when the pain receded, the efficacy of the pool water in transforming the body did not diminish in the slightest. It was even better under the effect of the Dragon Tiger Gold pill. It’s the equivalent of icing down shells.

After consuming something, its effect left him second-guessing his thoughts. In reality, it was indeed appropriate. This Dragon Tiger Golden Dan, an eighth-order treasure, was among the rewards Luu had obtained. Most of the items were seventh-order treasures, and the only eighth-order treasures were the Dragon Tiger Gold Pill and the Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul Suppressor Stone. As an eighth-rank treasure, the Dragon Tiger Golden Dan held a slight degree of uniqueness.

Luo could distinctly feel a soothing sensation spreading throughout his body under the influence of the Sword Pond's water. Under unusual circumstances, this soothing feeling would have been overwhelmed by endless pain. However, Luu's situation was different. Nearby, Xiao Wuan prepared to rescue Luu, wanting him to suffer but not leave any psychological scars. However, contrary to his expectations, Luu didn't scream in pain; instead, his eyebrows relaxed, revealing a pleasant expression. This bewildered Xiao Wuan, who couldn't comprehend the situation. He wondered if Luu was a legendary masochist or if it was due to Luu's unique physique.

Xiao Jing, meanwhile, couldn't hold back and climbed out of the pool. He dried his body and, breathing heavily, glanced at Luu. He remembered Luu's initial appearance and wondered about his brother's condition. When Xiao Jing saw Luu bathing with enjoyment, he became skeptical. He approached his father and asked what was happening. Xiao Wuan shook his head, unsure if Luu's physique was special.

After an hour of soaking, Luu stepped out of the pool, wishing he could stay longer. The pool was truly enjoyable. However, the subsequent body hardening cultivation was less exciting. Ordinary children would have struggled to continue, but Luu understood the importance of cultivation and the rarity of this opportunity. If not for the unique nature of the Sword in Marshall Way, Luu would have had to wait until he was three weeks old to formally cultivate. Additionally, Luu aimed to break through to the sixth realm as soon as possible to obtain his father's Polaris spaceship. The universe was vast, and Luu wanted to explore it.

After three hours of cultivation, Luu opened his eyes and noticed his skin had become tougher. This step seemed to correspond to the first realm of martial arts for normal first-realm martial artists, whose skin color and texture would change due to constant flesh tempering. However, Luu's skin didn't become rough but instead became more supple, giving off a warm, moist Jade-like feeling.

At this moment, Xiao Jing arrived and reminded Luu it was time to eat. As the two had grown familiar, Xiao Jing spoke in a less timid tone. Luu agreed, and they headed to dinner. At the table, Luu was amazed by the rich dishes but struggled to reach them due to his short arms. He needed to stand on a chair to grab the food. Xiao Wuan remained cold and quiet, as the mansion housed very few people, with no servants in sight. Luu's appetite was extraordinary, likely due to practicing martial arts. Xiao Wuan couldn't help but offer Luu some dishes.

Xiao Jing, seeing Luu struggle, felt a pang of guilt. Luu noticed this scene and was a bit surprised, as he knew the father-son relationship wasn't great but not as bad as he initially thought. Perhaps there was a hidden agenda. Luu didn't ask many questions and simply offered a chicken leg to Xiao Jing, who was moved to silence. Xiao Wuan then brought up politics, catching Luu off guard.

I was a bit curious because I'm leading mankind to Greatness, then I must understand the current system and how it works. Luu gave his answer in this world, although individual strength was important, there were some things that were ultimately beyond the power of just one person. Xiaan Yuan did not take Luu's words as a joke, as he slowly said, "If you want to do all of this, then don't study in the cabinet."
Luu asked curiously, "That group of people in the cabinet are standing too high. What they see is not the real situation."
Jaia Wuan slowly spoke, "You need to go and see for yourself, confirming place by place, in order to know the truest situation. That group of people in the cabinet all day long, they're hooking up. You won't be able to learn anything."
Xiao Jing, who was feeling sad alone, heard the conversation between the two and couldn't help but open his mouth. "What are they talking about?"
Chapter 42: More Mental Than a Psychopath
Luu slowly nodded when he heard this, but he doesn't easily change his opinion just because of someone else's tripe. Since ancient times, people who can achieve great things must have strong self-conquest, and the system is in order. The line is constant on top of that, you have to be good at hiring people and even better at listening to the advice of others. But not all advice is good; being able to pick the most correct advice out of a bunch is the real deal. It's about having absolute Vision.
Luu thought for a moment and spoke, "But I think that my studies in the cabinet are not useless."
Xia Wuan glanced at Luu with some surprise, not expecting him to oppose his words. Xia Wuan asked with some surprise, "Then tell me, what's the use?"
Luu spoke without thinking, "Even if I personally go and see place by place to know the truest situation, the implementation of every policy, however, inevitably has to go through one person after another. There are many things that are not game instructions that can be accomplished smoothly as long as they are conveyed. There's no telling how many links you have to go through in the middle, and it's easy for all sorts of things to go wrong with all the intertwined interests and the intricacies of the various components. It's not as easy to know what needs to be changed and change it right away. Politics isn't that simple, and what the teacher just said, while there is some truth to it, is overall too simple."
Xiao Onean is he even despised this? This is something that I never dreamed would happen in all these years. It was the first time he had been called Simple. The bottom line is, it's still being despised by a three-year-old.
For a moment, Jaia Wuan's face was a bit taught. Meanwhile, when Xiao Jing, who was on the side, heard this, his scalp tingled for a moment. Luu opposes his father, even if he actually said that his father is too simple. Although he couldn't understand the conversation between the two and didn't know who was right and who was wrong, Luu said that his father was simple, which was very serious.
Just as J Jing was in shock, Jaia Wuan suddenly burst out laughing. "Haaha. Kid, how dare you call me simple? Do you know that ever since I achieved the Sword Emperor realm, I've been the chief Marshall commanding all the troops and Horses of Great Sia? Under my command, the major Legions of Dashia all conquering, all conquering during that period of time. My achievements, your old man can't catch up with it. Even if you beat your horse, if he hadn't broken through the 10th realm, I'm afraid he'd still be working for me as a deputy. You're just learning a little bit from the cabinet side, and you dare to say that I'm simple. If you say this out, you are not afraid that you will have to laugh off other people's teeth?"
When Luu heard this, he couldn't help but widen his eyes and open his mouth. It was the first time he had ever met someone who argued with him, a child, in a serious manner. The most crucial thing was that the other party was still a peak Marshall Emperor, claiming to be half a step away from breaking through to Marshall Saint. If this matter were to be spread out, no one would believe it at all.
"All right. Generally speaking, arguing with a three-year-old child like him is humiliating. If you won and even more humiliating if you lost. So few people bother with him. But Xia Wuan obviously didn't care so much and at this moment, he directly rolled up his sleeves and was about to have a big fight with that kind of mental state. It's almost more mental than mentally ill. No wonder he's still recuperating. Dare I say that he's really not well? What's the matter, you milky brat, dumbfounded by my words?"
Seeing that Luu didn't speak, Jaia Wuan immediately sneered, "You don't dare to speak at this, you don't have your father's guts at all, do you? Still want to clarify the Jade and change the sky and the Earth dream on?"
Luu was directly hit. Luu had thought not to be General with the patient. No matter what he is ultimately his own master. Who thought that he had backed down, and the other party did not stop directly stomping on the nose, somewhat annoyed.
Luu said nonchalantly, "So it's a stinking subai. I said how you are so simple. Of course, fighting a war must investigate all the situation and then according to the local conditions, military law under strict orders."

It is very simple to implement, but where else would it be so simple? Are you not simple-minded? How dare you use your generation to oppress me as a small child. Are you going to say next that you've eaten more salt than I've eaten rice? It's so unashamed. Shame on you.

The word was a bit unfamiliar, but Xia Wuan quickly recognized it as an abusive term. Hearing the next words, he couldn't help but sneer and say, "Corruption at all levels, upward and downward, and a multitude of maladies. Is this also considered an excuse? Why can the Army carry out orders without any problems, but because of a little mistake, I have to be executed? Why doesn't it work anywhere else? It's because it's too indulgent and lenient."

Xiao Jing saw such a situation and was stunned. He never dreamed that his father had quarreled with his elder brother. He wanted to stop it, but his voice was drowned out and didn't even set off a little wave. Luu couldn't help but snicker as he listened to Jia and Yuan's words. "You want to kill people to establish authority, but how many people can you kill? If you can get things done by killing people, then you're really simple. How can there be anything that's simple in this world?"

In Luu's previous life, there was once such an emperor who tried to use harsh criminal law to deter all the officials. As long as the embezzlement was uncovered, the officials were killed to the end. Once no one was available, the officials in the prison office had to finish the work and then be executed. But even that still didn't make the big picture any better. Killing to establish authority, you are thinking too simply. With militarized management, big data monitoring, and artificial intelligence supervision, what can't be done is just that you don't want to.

Xia Wuan said with a cold smile. Hearing this, Luu couldn't help but be dumbfounded. The times were progressing, and the means would naturally become more numerous, but the problem was that the hearts of the people would not change. Still, you think it's simple. Luu frowned and said, "Things definitely won't be as simple as you think. Any tool used by people to suppress the original class with cruelty will only give birth to a new privileged class, and it will become even more aggravated than the original. If the politics of terror is practiced and the roads are made visible, there will be only one result, and that is a fall into the abyss. So it is with the human heart, and even more so with human nature. You should know better than me."

Listening to Luu's words, Jia and Wuan no longer retorted. These truths, he understood from the very beginning, even clearer than Luu, just not willing to admit it. After a long silence, he suddenly smiled pale and then slowly said, "You are right. This is human nature. This is the human community. So you want to rebel against the human community for some reason, Lu?"

Luu realized that he had said the wrong thing. This was a topic that couldn't be touched, at least not out of his own mouth. If he had uttered the words that made Xia Wuan remember this path, the fun would be great. It turned out to be surprising that he had led to Jia and Wuan's defection. Then, Luu really couldn't wash himself away, even if he jumped into the Yellow River. Luckily, at this moment, Xia Wuan didn't have such thoughts. After hearing Luu's words, he looked at him in surprise. "Why do you say that?"

Luu thought for a moment and said, "Because I see that you seem to be very disappointed in the human community. Although I am disappointed in the human race, this is after all the race that gave birth to me and raised me. It's not to this point." Xia Wuan shook his head and said slowly. Hearing this, Luu nodded in silence. So it seems that this is not the reason why Xia Wuan rebelled against the human race. What exactly is the other reason?

Before Luu could think too much, after finishing his meal, Xia Wuan called for someone to drive Luu back, telling him to come back tomorrow. "Dad, don't be angry." Xiao Jing carefully looked at Xia Wuan and hesitated for a long time before opening his mouth. "Angry? Why am I angry?" Xia Wuan calmly glanced at Xiao Jing and asked in a somewhat strange manner. "Ha."

Xiao Jing froze for a moment but still said, "I see you guys were just arguing. Quarrel." Xia Wuan said lightly, "Do you mean the argument we just had? Did that look like an argument? It doesn't look like a fight. It was simply a fight, right? If it wasn't for the disparity in strength, I'm afraid that it would have been a fight, right?" Xiao Jing spat these words in his heart but his mouth said, "It's good that you don't take it to heart, father. A three-year-old arguing with me, how could I possibly take it to heart?" Xia Wuan said unconcernedly. "However, Luu is indeed an interesting person. He has his own opinions and won't compromise even if he argues with me. Such a person is worthy of your following. You've recognized a good big brother, ah." Xiao Jing was surprised to hear this. "It's getting late. Go to the 10,000...

In the Swords Pavilion, Lu You was far behind in his cultivation. "Don't let him surpass you!" Xiao Wuan urged. "I can't afford to lose this person." Xiao Jing nodded in agreement.

Aboard the spaceship, Lu You took out a bottle of juice and was about to take a sip and find a sofa to rest when Lu Changsheng's voice startled him. "You've got guts, arguing with your master on the first day! In a few days, will you be the one uncovering the tiles on the roof?"

Lu You whirled around, looking at his infuriating old man. "Why do you keep appearing out of nowhere, scaring me? How can you break through the Ten Realms if you're so timid? How can you carry the great beam of the human race?"

Lu Changsheng glanced at Lu You. "Were you there just now, Dad? Why didn't you show up? Is it because you're afraid I'll be in danger, or are you afraid you won't be able to argue with my master?"

Lu You asked curiously. "You're the only one who can argue with him. You actually called him a stinking chowderhead! What guts!"

Lu Changsheng shook his head. "If those generals under his command heard that, their guts would have been scared out of their wits. Are the ones Master brags about all true?"

Lu You asked with some curiosity. "Of course, it's true. Not everyone is like you and likes to brag," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.

"I didn't realize that Master, who was so refined and had the appearance of a swordsman, actually had such skill," Lu You said in surprise. "Didn't you just despise him?" Lu Changsheng asked.

"We were arguing at the time. Of course, I had to verbally attack a bit," Lu You mumbled thoughtfully. "Besides, Master does seem a bit extreme, and I think I'm right."

"You're quarreling with Master, and you actually say you're right? It seems your ass is a little itchy," Lu Changsheng rolled up his sleeves. "So, Dad, you think I'm wrong?"

Lu You saw the situation and asked in a hurry. "That's right," Lu Changsheng said immediately. "Then you still want to hit me?" Lu You's eyes widened.

"If you're right, you can't hit you. And you're really right because you have no respect in your eyes. One size does not fit all. Don't confuse me," Lu Changsheng wouldn't be wound up by Lu You.

"Fine," Lu You nodded helplessly. Lu Changsheng pulled Lu You's pants away and raised his palm high, but when it fell, no sound appeared. Lu Changsheng not only didn't hit him but also made a move to pinch Lu You's soft, bouncing little butt. "A child's ass is so soft, you could pinch it."

Lu You opened his mouth in shock. "Dad, you're a pervert! How to talk? Do you really want to get beaten up?"

Lu Changsheng gave him a look. "Oh, Lu You, honestly, pinch it, pinch it. Who let him be a child or a three-year-old? No human rights!"

"He wasn't like this before," Lu Changsheng suddenly said. "Is it because of the Evil Gods' contamination?" Lu You asked.

"Aha," Lu Changsheng nodded. "Then I won't fight with Master from now on," Lu You said.

"Oh, why?" Lu Changsheng asked. "I'm afraid that he won't be able to talk me out of it and he'll just go straight for it when he gets impatient. I can't beat him," Lu You replied.

When Lu Changsheng heard this, he couldn't help but be a bit speechless. He thought that this kid finally knew about honoring his teacher and thinking about Xiao Wuan's lack of ease, so he stepped back and didn't argue with him. Who would have thought it was just the fear of a beating? No matter what he does, he gets serious with a little kid like you.

Lu Changsheng shook his head. "Really, then next time if Master gets anxious and wants to beat me up, Dad, you have to help me fight back," Lu You's eyes lit up and he said with a smile.

Lu Changsheng, this kid really knows how to stomp his nose. This mixed-up nature really can't do anything with him. "I think you're the one who wants to get beat up in the end," Lu Changsheng still couldn't hold back and gave him a slap on the ass.

Lu You took the beating and immediately understood one thing. It seems that in the future, even if he gets beaten up, his old man will not help him get back. Sure enough, in the end, you're on your own. I am not yet strong. There are changes when you're strong.

"By the way, didn't you say you wanted to change the sky and clarify the Jade, make the human race great again?" Lu Changsheng suddenly spoke.

"What's wrong?" Lu You asked curiously. "Then it won't do for you to only learn those political tactics in the cabinet. You also need to learn how to command the army and fight a nice big battle. What do you think?" Lu Changsheng said slowly.

"Right, Dad, you have a point," Lu You's eyes widened as he nodded. "That does need to be learned. It's also important."

"Then since you have a readymade master, why don't you seek him out to learn these skills instead of calling him a stinking chupacabra?" Lu Changsheng glanced at Lu You.

"What kind of reasoning is that?" Lu You hurriedly assured him. "Then I will definitely not quarrel with Master in the future. From now on, he's my best master."

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

Luu, with a look of surprise, asked with equal surprise, "Aha, Luu nodded vigorously yesterday I argued with Master, and after I went home, I thought about it for a long time. I think that Master has a very valid point: power can only come from the barrel of a gun. In the end, it's not just about making political concessions; it's hard to make things happen with just political tactics, even if you're the best at it. Eventually, there will be a time when you're struggling to keep up, unable to weigh the situation. At that point, you need to master the ability to lift the table, even if those old foxes are more skilled at their calculations and their chess moves are seamless. I'll just rip up the chessboard and smash him to death."

Listening to Luu's words, Jaia Wan nodded faintly and said, "Not bad. Since you want to learn, I'll teach you."

"Many thanks, Master Luu," said the latter in a hurry.

At this moment, Xiao Jing, who was on the side, weakly said, "I also want to learn."

Xiao Wan glanced at him and said, "You're not that mature yet, okay." Xiao Jing lowered his head.

Luu saw the scene and thought to himself that the relationship between this father and son was really strange. It was as if there was some kind of unspoken agreement between them, the son feared the father, and the father disliked the son. There must be a reason for this situation. Only when asked did Xiao Jing stammer for half a day and couldn't say anything. "If you ask the master, you'll get even less of an answer," said Luu. "It's been a long time coming, so maybe we'll find out later.

"Let him learn on the sidelines," said Luu. "If I become a Grand Marshal in the future, I'll need a few deputies or something by my side. He hasn't even started learning yet, and he's thinking about becoming a Grand Marshal later on. That's a serious and funny statement. If there were any bystanders present, they would have laughed out loud. But Xiao Wan didn't laugh; instead, he nodded his head in a serious manner, thinking it made sense.

"That's right. Then let him learn on the side," said Xiao Wan. "Xiao Jing didn't think there was anything wrong with that either and gratefully glanced at Luu. At this moment, the two of them had already finished their cultivation, and the effect of further cultivation was minimal, so they were considered to have some free time.

"Jaia Wan glanced at the two brats and directly began to explain. But the things Xiao Wan talked about weren't what Luu had expected. He had thought that Xiao Wan would explain the Art of War, talking about how to deploy troops, how to command an army, and how to fight a beautiful war. Yet Jaia Wan said not a word about any of this. He talked about military-civilian integration, national defense mobilization, military service, and logistical preparations.

"Luu listened with raised eyebrows, and Xiao Jing on the side was even more bewildered, thinking that his father was right – he wasn't this material at all and couldn't learn it. "What I want to learn is to fight in wars, not these governmental jobs," said Luu.

"(That's what fighting a war is fundamentally about), isn't it?" asked Xiao Wan in return. "The Grand Marshal you want to be, or a general?"

"I want to be the Grand Marshal," said Luu. "That's not it. Could I still lie to you?" asked Xiao Wan, shaking his head and saying indifferently.

"What fighting a war competes with is never the subtlety of tactical skills. Instead, it's the preparations for the big picture. With all the preparations, one can fight a war until the enemy is defeated," said Xiao Wan. 

Luu let out a deep breath. He had to admit that he was the one who had thought things through simplistically. 

Xiao Wan continued, "What our human community has to face is not a city, a place, or an enemy of one or two planets, but one group of alien races after another. These alien groups with their territory spanning long stellar domains and controlled planets, trying to defeat them is not something that can be decided in one or two wars. A war, even if it is one beautifully executed, even if all the other side is wiped out, it is just an insignificant small victory for the whole situation. 

"If you want to become a Grand Marshal, you must raise your sights. Don't be blinded by momentary successes and failures, victories and defeats on one battlefield. You must have a total view of the whole situation and command everything.

"Speaking of which, let me ask you: are you clear on the difference between strategy and tactics?"

Xiao Jing tensed up at once, but fortunately he quickly reacted to the fact that the question wasn't asked about himself. 

Hearing this question, Luu thought for a moment and opened his mouth to ask, "Strategy is the overall framework of the macro aspect, while tactics are the methods and means, which are a bit more microscopic."

"Not bad," said Xiao Wan.

"Is strategy more important or tactics?" asked Luu, frowning and pondering for a moment before replying, "Strategy."

Xiao Wan glared at him and said, "Wait, a commander who only knows strategy - what's the difference between that and talking on paper? If you dare to go to war, if you only know the strategy, who would dare to feel confident in handing over this great power to you?"

Hearing this, Luu reacted acted you mean that strategy and tactics are equally important. Only then,

Here is the text with improved English, maintaining the original meaning:

It was Xiao Wuan who had initially made the point that strategy and tactics are equally important, but war is far from that simple. "It's like what we argued about yesterday," Wuan said, "when you said that many things aren't just game instructions that can be accomplished smoothly, as long as they're communicated. There's no telling how many steps you have to go through in between, and it's easy for all sorts of things to go wrong. That's true, but if you think it's only true of politics, you're mistaken. The same is true of the military. Any instruction you give will go wrong, and if you want to command the whole world, you need to take into account every detail."

Wuan paused for a moment before continuing. "How can a man who is a commander establish his authority? Can he make his subordinates listen carefully to his instructions and not take his words as empty promises?"

Luu pondered for a moment before speaking. "Hearing these two words - 'murder' - aside, Xiao Wuan suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He subconsciously thought of the past and wondered if it was possible for a commander to establish his authority solely through fear and punishment.

Xiao Wuan and Wuan had a history of arguing about this topic. Wuan was known for his ruthless tactics, and the two were often at odds over their approaches. But this time, Wuan's words were different. "Just why do you want to kill?" Xiao Wuan asked, his eyes flashing with a hint of admiration. Wuan replied, "Killing the wrong person can be avoided, but killing is the most direct method. And if one kills at all, one shouldn't worry about who is killed; it's not that simple."

Xiao Wuan's face finally revealed a smile. "If a commander doesn't even have this much ruthlessness, then it would be better to rule with an iron fist and not risk annihilating the human race."

Xiao Jing, who was on the other side, glanced at Wuan with newfound admiration. Despite being younger than him, Wuan was certainly one of the most ruthless commanders he had ever met. But there was also something about Wuan that left him in the dust - his unyielding determination.

Wuan paused and continued, "However, being merely ruthless isn't enough. A commander needs real skills and a way to make others fear him. If you don't, your subordinates will eventually turn on you and cut your head off."

"'Don't trust your identity and family history to save you in critical moments like this," Wuan said, his voice low and serious. "Survival is all that matters, no matter who you are or where you come from."

Luu asked, "Could this have happened before? If you're the son of a Marshall Saint, won't they warn you first?"

Wuan nodded indifferently. "That's right. When the Marshal of Diaa was a foolish person who came from a big family, he didn't know anything, but because of human relations, he rose to power step by step and eventually became the Grand Marshall of everything."

"And that's how he lost his head," Luu added dryly.

The two of them chuckled. Wuan continued, "I had to persuade him a few times, but it was useless. He wouldn't listen. We had no choice but to cut off his head and hang it high on the flag, so everyone would tremble at the sound of our commands."

Luu opened his mouth in shock. "I can hardly believe that actually happened! Master, Dad, it was all kept secret, and I hadn't even heard of it before."

Wuan smiled wryly. "Well, it's not all that simple, is it? Cutting off the head of a Marshal and promoting him to Grand Marshall is not something to be taken lightly. It's a matter of great power and influence, and not many people know what goes into it."

Xiao Jing winced at Wuan's words. "Your words are simple, but the reality behind them is hard to ignore."

Wuan's face showed a tinge of nostalgia, remembering past battles. "Long ago, when we were still in the Imperial General's ranks, there was a Marshall Emperors who was quite... cunning. It wasn't easy to kill him, even when we delayed for a little while longer, waiting for his reinforcements to arrive."

Luu asked, curious, "How can someone at the Marshal Emperor realm still be a fool when elevated to such power?"

Xuan replied, "The physical and spiritual body are not the only things that are enhanced with elevation to the realm. A martial Emperor who is willing to learn will pick up many new things in a short time. Therefore, there can't be strong people who are truly stupid."

Luu nodded. "I see. Then why did it still happen, even to the Great General?"

Xuan said, "There must be a reason for everything. But this event is... much more complex than it initially seems. There are hidden secrets I fear I'll never be able to tell you."

Xiao Jing looked at Wuan with newfound understanding. Wuwan didn't intend to cover it up; his candor was genuine.

Up and continued speaking of that idiot's family, it's actually still around now. Luu froze for a moment and continued, "What's it called? The U family of the mountain and sea star region. Their family is too big, mastering many industries in the day. Too big to fail." Jia Wuan didn't hide anything and answered directly, "Your family, Yu Guan Chung." Luu's eyes widened in dismay, "I know a Yu Guan Chung. He can't be the U family, right?" "You guessed correctly. He's the first son of the U family's generation," Jia Wuan said indifferently. "Now that you know this, what do you think?" "I really didn't expect that there would be such a connection," Luu said in surprise. "In that case, why is their family so close to my family? For such a great family, there are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests. Your father is a marshal saint, of course, they want to befriend your father. This is normal and nothing hard to understand," Xiao Wuan said indifferently. Luu frowned and after a long while, his brows loosened again. "This is all in the past. Back then, I proposed to your father that since he had offended the E family, then he should simply cleanse the U family. Since the current state of the human race is like this, then he should simply come up with a complete and utter cleansing, just like what you said, to change the heavens and change the earth." Jia Wuan said to himself, "Ha, he's too merciful. Everything is not broken since he's become a martial saint and is fully capable of doing so. Why not go and do so? Pity, pity. Your father didn't listen to me. You think I'm too radical, too paranoid about the human race. Far from it. As a result, you see now all over the parties, what the hell has become. Your father went around asking for a statement and only barely got back some benefits, but only some, not enough to change the status quo. Even to treat the symptoms are problematic, not to mention treating the root cause. If he had been more ruthless in the beginning, then the situation now would definitely not be like this." Saying this, Jia Wuan suddenly came closer as he stared into Luu's eyes, "What do you think?" As if Luu didn't notice Xiao Wuan's compulsion, he widened his eyes and nodded his head. "Master's words make too much sense. I've long said that my untalented marshal saint old man can't be relied upon at all. Indeed, ah, the facts have proven me right. It seems that this Ria, as well as the entire human community, needs a savior like me. How the future changes, it still depends on me. It's a shame I'm so small. They all take my words as a joke. Damn it, when I grow up, I'm sure I'll be able to clarify the Jade Kingdom completely, change the heavens and the Earth, and make the human race great again. Master, since you're so capable, get well and come be my grand marshal later. Let's come together and change this human community. Do something big and bold." The more Luu spoke, the more excited he became, and I don't blame him for being excited. If he could pull in a marshal emperor or a peak marshal emperor, then who would dare to underestimate him? This was simply the most powerful helper. Xiao Jin, who was on the side, listened to Luu bragging, and his face was filled with admiration, while Jia Wuan looked at Luu's expression. He was full of surprise. His brows were locked, and he didn't know what he was thinking. He didn't interrupt Lou's bragging words for a while. "Master, what do you think? Come and help me, master." Master Jia Wuan slowly raised his head as he stared at Luu with a complicated expression, as if he wanted to confirm in Luu's eyes whether his great ambition was just a mere cute joke. Luu, however, was not the least bit afraid. His sparkling eyes filled with sincerity as he looked earnestly at his master, Xiao Wuan. When Xiao Wuan saw such a look, he once again fell into silence for a while. Chapter 46: Hope for the Future. Luu had thought that his sincerity would surely impress his master. Who would have thought that after a long time, Jia Wuan just let out a light laugh and then even more so, he couldn't stop laughing and directly threw his head back and laughed, "Haaha, haahahaha." The laughter was so magnificent that the gloom that used to hang over his head seemed to have been dispersed. When Luu and Xiao Jing heard such laughter, they couldn't help but look at each other in disbelief. Luu's eyes meant, "What's going on here?" Xiao Jing's eyes meant, "I don't know. It's my first time encountering it, too." Lou, you returned another look, is your father having an attack? Should we call a doctor over? Xiao Jing shook his head, probably meaning, "I don't know. It's my first time encountering it, as well." Luu glared at him in dissatisfaction, probably meaning, "How come you don't know anything, you punk?" Xiao Jing immediately gave a pitiful look that probably meant, "I'm sorry." Meanwhile, Jiaan Yuan laughed for a long time before he looked down at Luu and said disdainfully, "With a three-year-old child like you, you still want me to follow you. Really know how to dream. With this skill of yours, you can't write, you can't fight, you don't know how to use the military, you don't know how to use people, and you want to fool a marshal emperor just by relying on your sharp tongue. Do you think highly of yourself or do you look down on the marshal emperor? You claim to change the sky and clarify the Jade, but do you really know the difficulty of it? There are..."

If there are certain things you wish to accomplish, you may not want others to know about them, unless you wish to undervalue yourself. If you truly aspire to achieve these goals in the future, then it's better to act more and speak less. Xia Wuan's series of questions caused Luu's eyes to widen, and just as he was about to respond, Xia Wuan continued, "If you genuinely believe this, then continue learning how to utilize the military alongside me." Stimulated by Luu, the difficulty of the next course immediately escalated. Xia Wuan transitioned directly from basic theoretical knowledge to the practical application of war. He presented all of his large-scale battles and the numerous formidable adversaries he had encountered in the past as teaching materials.

In those years, the entire human community was shrouded in a storm of countless powerful enemies, with the prying eyes of an evil god almost determining the key to their survival. At that time, Luu's father had not yet attained the realm of a Marshall Saint. In other words, it was Xia Wuan who held up the sky for the Grand and even the entire human race under his leadership. The human race overcame countless difficulties and obstacles, one war after another, and created one miracle after another until the next critical moment. Xia Wuan gradually retired from the frontlines due to his injuries. However, his might gradually became insufficient in the eyes of outsiders.

Luu, of course, knew that Xia Wuan was incredibly powerful. However, when he saw the other party using the wars he commanded as teaching materials and listened to the mind-boggling data, he was momentarily stunned and couldn't help but say, "I'm only three years old. Isn't it too early for me to learn all this?" Xia Wuan glanced at Luu and said painfully, "Isn't this the simplest thing? If you don't learn from this, do you still want to learn a lifetime of strategy and tactics and then become an embroidered pillow that commands empty talk about strategy? Do you also want someone to cut off your head and hang it high? Is this bit of difficulty all you aspire to?"

Luu was instantly trapped. He gritted his teeth and said, "I'll learn." Luu could feel that previously, when teaching civil-military integration, national defense mobilization, military service work, and logistical preparations, Xia Wuan was only teaching a qualified Marshall what he should be doing. However, at the moment, teaching these examples of war, Xia Wuan was teaching Luu to become an excellent, if not top, Grand Marshall. Xiao Jing, who was on the side, was just an ordinary child. Despite trying hard to keep up with the progress of the lessons, he couldn't even smell the exhaust, let alone catch up. All he could do was listen in a plausible manner. His older brother Luu, however, not only understood but also asked rhetorical questions from time to time. This left Xiao Jing out of reach, and his heart was even more admiring of this teaching.

Turning to the middle of the night, Luu really couldn't support his upper and lower eyelids, crazily fighting to keep his eyes open. How could he not stop? Eyes closed, and Xiao Jing leaning against each other, they fell asleep. Seeing this scene, Xia Wuan's expression was a little complicated. He sighed softly and muttered, "Is the future hopeful Marshall Saint's residence?"

By Yu Yao said with some concern, "Why hasn't little Luu returned yet? He slept at Xia's house tonight." Lu Chang Xang said carelessly, "Like this." By Yu Yao couldn't help but furrow her brows when she heard this. "This cultivation is also too hard. He's only a little bit older, cultivating at such a high intensity isn't good for his body. Can Xia Wuan still not understand this?"

Lu Chang Xing smiled and said, "The daily basic cultivation is just that." By Yu Yao asked with some doubt, "Then what?" Lu Chang Xing explained, "Luu is learning the way to use the Army." By Yu Yao froze for a moment. "Right, Lu Chang nodded. "Right," By Yu Yao glared at him and said with a speechless face, "He's only this old, going to the cabinet to listen to politics and see the world is fine, but you're actually letting him follow Xia Wuan to learn how to use the military. Is this something a three-year-old should learn?"

Lu Chang Ching smiled and said, "He has his own big ambitions. So these things, he has to learn them sooner or later. If you want to learn how to use the military and learn how to fight, then I'm afraid there's no better teacher than brother when you w in the entire human community." When By Yu Ya heard this, she couldn't help but sigh and say helplessly, "I am afraid that the burden he carries is too heavy, and he is too tired of living. He didn't have to be like this. Even if he is your son, it's not that the son of a Marshall Saint has to become the next Marshall Saint. But he has his own ideas."

Lu Chang Ching smiled and said, "If he wants to do so, then let him do so. Isn't that good?" By Yu Yao was silent for a long time before nodding. "We can only let him be." The next day, the cabinet ministers who came here glanced at Luu with some surprise. Luu wasn't afraid of being a stranger and waved his small hand as if he had seen an old friend and greeted these cabinet ministers. The people responded. The first two days, Luu...

We thought Luu wouldn't come again. After all, he is just a child with a child's mind. We thought this side of the fun would be enough, and coming over for a trip would not be fun anymore. Who knew that Luu had reappeared in the cabinet?

Chapter 47: I have something to say. It had only been a few days, but Luu's temperament was obviously different. The whole person was like a sharp sword. It's true that the Seraphim are not as good as they used to be. It seems that Luu has started to practice martial arts. Those with eyesight also saw that Luu practiced the way of the sword in martial arts. The sword is the most powerful way in martial arts today. Even retired and recuperating Martial Arts Emperor Xiao Wuan Xia would admit that.

W Yuans' relationship with the Marshall Saint was not bad. It seemed like it should be natural for Xiaan to teach Luu the way of sword and martial arts. But one's character was too aggressive, with a reckless acting style. It was said that back then, Marshall Saint L Ching's boldness revolutionized the rule of officials, sweeping away the ills, and acting in a bold style. This resulted in Xia Wuan complaining that he was too timid and too conservative in his actions, leading to a big fight. I really dare not imagine if the one who achieved Marshall Saint back then was not Lu Chang Xang but Jia Wuan. What kind of situation would it be now? Letting such a person teach Luu doesn't seem right. Many people thought so and glanced at Luu with some concern. However, this matter was not something they could meddle with and there was no point in thinking about it anymore.

Soon, the cabinet crowd began to deliberate because of Luu's appearance. The smell of gunpowder from the previous two days had faded a lot. For one thing, Luu was too young, only 3 years old. It was too humiliating for a group of adults like them to tear their faces and argue hysterically in front of a child. The second was that Luu was the child of the Marshall Sage. If he showed a willingness to enter politics in the future, his status might be even higher than Jonza of the Marshall Sage sect. He would have to pay a little attention to his Image in front of him.

Grand Executive Officer Lu Xianghong clearly felt this and subconsciously let out a sigh of relief. He glanced at Luu and was tempted to say, "Can you please come to the cabinet every day to listen to politics? It's just not really a good thing to say." So he thought about it and kept his mouth shut. The name of the great executive officer sounded loud and clear and with the support of the Marshall sacred sect, it was even more unbeatable. But the hard work involved was something only he knew. He was nothing more than a Target launched by the Marshall sacred sect and it was simply impossible to really gain full support. Doing a good job would bring no credit, doing a little poorly would immediately surround him, making him not dare to relax for a moment.

The cabinet deliberations began. The battle for Hing was once again on the cards. Luu listened to the crowd talking and couldn't help but think, "It seems that the situation over there is indeed bad, otherwise it wouldn't have been brought up for repeated discussion." He listened quietly and found that in just a few days, the situation had taken a sharp turn for the worse and was almost facing the loss of its defense.

Luu glanced at Lu Xianghong again. The great executive officer's brows were furrowed as he heard about this matter and seemed to be in deep thought. "What's there to think about? Just do what you have to do," Luu thought. He then turned his head to look at the other cabinet members. They were still arguing, but when they listened carefully, it wasn't hard to hear the meaning inside their words, which was nothing more than shirking responsibility and pitting others down in the process.

While those who tried to propose a solution couldn't even intervene for a while. If it was the previous Luu, he would not have felt anything when he heard such a quarrel. But at this moment, when he heard these quarrels, a thought inexplicably arose in his heart. "How could he govern Dashia well with such bickering people?" Luu frowned and didn't open his mouth as he continued to listen to the proceedings.

After a long time, the person who had been trying to offer a solution to the situation was finally able to speak. But the advice he gave was nothing more than vague full support for the deployment of troops stationed in nearby starfields. This was going to involve the defenses of the other Star Realms. If the armies of the other Star Realms backed up, it would be tantamount to tearing down the East wall to make up for the West wall. And if something went wrong with the other defenses as well, it would be the end of the line.

Someone proposed to ask Marshall Saint L changing to go over to suppress it. This was the great killing weapon of Dashia and even the entire human race. As long as the Marshall saint was willing to make a trip, then the problem of the hellstar was nothing more than a small problem. However, this argument was quickly refuted. Inviting Marshall Saints to fight in this District's one battlefield would easily make the foreign races feel that the human race was empty, thus launching a large-scale war.

Luu sat on a kid's chair, listening to the proceedings, with a serious expression on his face.

While dining and listening to the crowd's discussion in a serious manner, Luu inquired about the Hellstar battle report to study it thoroughly. Lu Shang Hong paused upon hearing Luu's request but didn't refuse, sending him all the battle reports. Luu scrolled through the electronic screen, recalling his master's teachings, and soon noticed an issue. He questioned why the pension subsidy for war deaths, applied multiple times, was delayed.

Upon hearing this, Lu Shang Hong explained that the payments were usually sent after the war, but due to the intense battle in Hellstar, he had already approved half the quota to be sent early. Luu continued to ask if the pensions had been sent out, to which Lu Shang Hong replied that they were still in the process.

Luu found this unacceptable and asked if it would take 10 days and a half month. Lou couldn't help but express his frustration at the response, as the normal process would take about a month. Lu Shang Hong's expression turned unsightly, suspecting that this delay might have contributed to the Hellstar battlefield's loss.

Luu questioned the lengthy process, knowing that the corrupt system in Diaa was causing issues. However, Lu Shang Hong explained that this was a significant amount of money, over 3 trillion star dollars, and the required procedures must be followed. This figure shocked Luu, but it was the number of deaths behind it that truly surprised him.

To require over 3 trillion in death benefits, how many people must have died in the Hellstar battlefield? Luu estimated that if it was half the amount, it would be around 6 or 7 trillion. This meant that nearly 10 million people might have died in the Hellstar battlefield war. The tragic nature of the war left Luu thoughtful as he considered the lengthy pension approval process and the redundant government procedures.

Recalling his master's dissatisfaction with the government, Luu no longer hesitated and spoke up, sharing his thoughts on the matter. The cabinet members, who had been arguing, fell silent as Luu's clear, childish voice rang out. Luu's sudden intervention caught everyone off guard, including Lu Shang Hong.

This was the first time Luu had spoken at the cabinet meeting, as he had previously been observing and learning from the experienced politicians. However, Luu felt it was time to voice his opinion, as the cabinet members' blackened means and long-term insights could no longer go unaddressed. Luu questioned the need for such a lengthy process when they were aware of the Hellstar battle's grueling conditions and the unissued death benefits.

Luu suggested that instead of arguing, the cabinet members should focus on sending out the funds and supplies earlier to alleviate the war situation in Hellstar. Despite his young age, Luu's words carried weight, and the cabinet members fell silent, reflecting on his words.

Luu spoke up, saying, "Things are not as simple as that. Due to the Grand Seas Army, there have been numerous instances of misrepresentation and concealment. Misrepresentation of the number of soldiers in service, misrepresentation of the number of deaths, and embezzlement of soldiers' benefits, for various reasons. It is necessary to be careful when handing out money. After all, those soldiers died in battle for their country, and we have to verify the accuracy of the situation and ensure that the money is paid out to the soldiers' families. So, it's normal for the process to be slightly more cumbersome and drag on a little longer. I don't see any problem with that."
He continued, "I have to say, X Yen Jun's words indeed have some reason. The fault is all in the cabinet. Those military chiefs are what good goods? The sky is as black as a crow. Those military chiefs string soldiers' blood, embezzlement of soldiers' interests, and the phenomenon of private use of public weapons. They simply do not do too much often. Behind an outrageous regulation, there is definitely something outrageous going on. But this also leads to the fact that the cabinet does not trust the Army, and the Army trusts the cabinet even less. So, everyone rots together, and it's all rotten. But, Luu had his own opinions and would not be refuted by a few words. He thought that the other party was right. He looked at Jo Yan Jun, who was not budging in the slightest. The matter was urgent. The intensity of the Hellstar battlefield could be ranked in the entire Grand Seas Army. Don't you know the reasoning behind making special arrangements for special matters? Don't you know the reasoning behind stepping up your efforts and getting it done as soon as possible when these words came out, Jo Yan Jun, who had just been vibrant, was instantly speechless because what Luu said really made sense."
After a long time, someone else spoke up, saying, "Things have already come to this point. There's no point in talking about this anymore. The most important thing nowadays is to discuss how to bring the crisis in the Hellstar battlefield to an end."
Luu frowned and looked at the man, asking, "What's your name?"
The man froze and spoke, "Roy Chung."
You asked, "How did you get mixed up in the cabinet if you're so stupid?"
Luu asked back, "Roy Chun Yu, and Hoy being disliked and scolded in the face like this, an individual would be angry. But the problem is that the other party is a three-year-old child or the only son of the Marshall Saint. If you quarrel with him, it would be humiliating to win the quarrel and even more humiliating to lose the quarrel. That's why Roy Chun Yuan was directly choked out of speech. Luckily, Leu did not continue to scold him because he knew that this question was not difficult for me. The crowd opened their mouths in shock. They all wanted to laugh, but this scene was not suitable for laughter. It was no wonder that the crowd belittled him with the battle in Hellstar so tragic and difficult to support. This problem was indeed a headache."
If it is really a good solution, why do we need them, the cabinet ministers, to our you for half a day in such a situation? But he heard Luu continue, "Just repair a letter to that foreign race to negotiate a truce agreement so that everyone can take a break and ask them what conditions they want in order to stop this war. Make peace."
Hearing this, the cabinet all of them were dumbfounded. Is that okay? At that time, someone spoke up and said, "I'm afraid the other side won't agree. The foreigners are ferocious. They have suffered heavy deaths and injuries. They are already red-eyed with murder. How can they possibly make peace with us?"
Luu glanced at the man and said with a certainty in his tone, "The foreigners are also living beings. They will also be afraid and will also be imagining things. We died so many people on the Hellstar battlefield. Those foreigners will likewise not be less. With neither side pleasing the other, we almost collapsed as did the other side. Now, it's just the end of the line. If we issue a peace talk and stall for time, by doing so, they will surely disorganize themselves and then ask for everything that gives us breathing room. When the pensions and supplies are sent over, and our men have been reorganized, then we will have the courage of our convictions. And it will be up to us to make peace or not."

It would be nice to find spare troops to send there while this opportunity is open. The words came out once again, and the cabinet was silent. The crowd looked at Luu in shock, as if they were seeing him for the first time. Even the few cabinet members present seemed different, their mouths opening involuntarily, but no one said anything. They sighed in their hearts, wishing they could be children, free to speak their minds and solve problems without worrying about the attacks of their political opponents.

Chapter 49: Main Quest Completion

Jolie Shin Chang, the sword cabinet, had once said that among these people, there was not a single stupid person. Yuan CH had made the same statement. How could Luu be truly stupid? He was simply not good. Therefore, what Luu thought of had actually been considered long ago, and there were multiple ways to approach the problem. It was just not advisable to say it outright. For example, if Lon spoke out, he would surely be attacked by his political opponents and would not be able to solve the problem. Other solutions required involving the interests of many parties, necessitating extensive negotiations and bargaining. No one could reveal their bottom card at the beginning; such a person was not fit to be a chess player in the cabinet but only a pawn outside. If you were that naive and just thought about doing your job, you would be in trouble in just a few days. But at this moment, because Luu stood out and disrupted the original plan of this group of old foxes, they all looked at each other, unable to hide their surprise. It was as if they were recognizing Luu for the first time. Although these words were a bit childish, they suggested a solution, and the feasibility was still there. It was surprising that a three-year-old had such insights, but not many people would use this approach. Not to underestimate Luu, but they had long had a better way.

After a long silence, Jonza of the Marshall Sacred Sex stood out. He looked at Luu and said, "This is not acceptable. In a small Hellstar battlefield, we must compromise and make peace with the other side. If the news spreads, won't it make the other races feel that we are weak? I fear the consequences will be even more serious."

Luu couldn't help but frown. This was indeed a problem. The ploy of making peace was not something Luu had thought of, but there were actual cases where it was done. In the many tactics Xia Wuan talked about last night, there were quite a few methods of buffering with making peace, which ultimately achieved their strategic goals. Luu had thought of this ploy after seeing the Hellstar battle report, not in a rigid way but based on the tragedy of this place's battlefield. It could be used completely, but he hadn't considered that this was a different time and place. The human race was no longer in a stormy state; he had to maintain his image as the Heem of the Universe. This Hellstar battlefield was not even proper to think of inviting a Marshall Saint to go there, let alone make peace. This was naturally even less likely to be done.

This didn't work, and that didn't work. What should we do? Luu thought. Lon thought so, too. Looking around at the cabinet members, he saw them one by one, as if they were early planning, gradually understanding a little. In fact, this group of old foxes had long made up their minds, just because of the interests of their relationships. They did not come up with a solution to make the situation appear very bad and serious. In their minds, it was nothing at all. When Liu sat down, the group immediately began negotiations, drawing from the East and the West. In no time, they organized a strong reinforcement army, which was immediately sent to the Hellstar for support. This process would have been slow, but because of Luu's interference, the crowd tacitly agreed to speed it up.

Seeing this scene, Luu thought somewhat helplessly that this was not what he had expected. He had wanted to give the solution in this moment of public attention, not only to resolve the war situation in Hing but also to gain the approval of these cabinet ministers. Now it seemed that he was a bit naive. This cabinet thing was layer upon layer, like a lasagna. No one knew the other side's last card, and each was a sophisticated politician, no one simple. On second thought, if he hadn't stood up and scolded a few times, this group of people might have bargained over the Hellstar Battlefield for much longer, with many more people dying. He stepped up to the plate, and while it didn't work out, it at least accelerated the problem and made the pensions go out a little faster. So it wasn't pointless. One could even say it meant a lot. Only after such an outburst could Luu not speak more easily, and the next time he must.

He thought deeply and carefully before he could open his mouth to speak, not only for the sake of the mission but also to avoid falling into a trap and being taken advantage of, just as Luu was thinking this, a system prompt suddenly appeared before his eyes:

**Mission Accomplished:** You have been recognized by the heads of the major factions of the cabinet.

**Quest Reward:** Advent item - Jie Shin Chang Sword

**Jie Shin Chang Sword:**

* **Rank:** 7th
* **Quality:** Perfect
* **Type:** Weapon
* **Effect:** The sword's body is inscribed with countless runes, greatly enhancing the sharpness of the blade, greatly increasing the speed of the sword, and also enhancing to a certain extent the power that the host already possesses.
* **Description:** This sword came from the hands of a master swordsmith in ancient times, whose name can no longer be traced except for the position of the hilt. The front side is engraved with a "Gio," and the reverse side is engraved with a "Lee." It is unknown whether these are the name of the sword or the name of the swordsmith.

Luu looked at the words in front of him and couldn't help but freeze for a moment. To be honest, he hadn't really expected that this Mainline Quest would be completed so suddenly. He carefully thought about it and understood the reason. At only three years old, being able to say the words Fong just said and propose a solution to the problem was already very rare. If he had spoken these words forty years later, it would have been better if he hadn't been secretly despised, not to mention being recognized by these people. He had to say that this was the advantage of being young. Because the system came forty years early, the difficulty of the vast majority of tasks had become quite easy.

Just as Luu was thinking this, the cabinet meeting ended. Chona hugged Luu and left the cabinet. He looked at the boy with interest. Just now, he had rebuked the cabinet members at the cabinet meeting, facing a group of sophisticated foxes, not the slightest concession. That posture was truly extraordinary. There was even a solution given, although it wasn't perfect simply because he didn't know exactly what was going on, but it had to be said that the solution he gave under the limited conditions was already the optimal solution. The probability of success was definitely high if you really wanted to implement it. The bottom line was this: he was only three years old! It was amazing. It was true that he was worthy of being the son of a martial arts Saint. In fact, not only did he have this idea, almost all cabinet members couldn't help but heartily lament a later generation speaking in the cabinet for the first time.

"What do you think, Shunza?"  Shonza looked at his little face and asked with a smile.

Hearing Shunza's words, Luu couldn't help but let out a sigh.

"What are you sighing for?" Shonza asked.

Luu slowly said, "The cabinet of ministers are all smart people. I just said those words, but in their eyes, it is probably a laughing stock."

Hearing this, Shonza was a bit surprised, not expecting Luu to be able to think so deeply. He shook his head and said, "That's not the case. You don't know much to be able to give that insight is already rare, and no one finds you ridiculous. Even on the contrary, I'm afraid many people would envy you."

"Why do you envy me?" Luu asked with some curiosity.

"Because you're the only one who can directly say what you want to say without having to worry about this or that. Just think about the solution," Shonza explained. "They are usually tired of hooking up with each other, always thinking about this and that."

Luu nodded thoughtfully. "I also probably know why there are so many intelligent and top-notch people in the cabinet, but even a little bit of a small problem has to be discussed for half a day before they can be solved."

"Originally, they are stuck on internal conflicts," Shonza nodded and said helplessly. "It can't be helped. They are all standing in their own positions, speaking for their own interests. If they can be twisted into a rope, a lot of problems won't be considered a problem, but alas, it's simply not possible."

Hearing this, Luu looked up to the sky and silently thought, "Not yet. After I grow up, I will change all of this with my own hands. Really, such a bunch of bug bears, how can we govern the country? I really don't blame Master for being radical. It's really because this group of people who are obviously extremely intelligent don't put their minds on governance at all, and each one of them is fighting for power. Do you think these people don't know what will happen to them if they do this? The cabinet is like this, and the degree of redundancy in the administrative organizations of various places is really unimaginable. It is impossible for them to be unaware of these phenomena, but even knowing this, they still won't change. The reasons for this are many and complex and cannot be explained by simple stupidity and badness."

After returning home, Luu glanced at the Jie Shin Chang Sword in the system space and hurriedly took it out. "Nice!" Luu couldn't help but sigh in admiration as he felt the sharpness of the sword blade. The body of the sword was engraved with complicated runic patterns, and at the moment, it was slowly blooming with a shimmering light. As a seventh-ranked sword, this sword had even produced a certain amount of spiritual intelligence, able to simply accept some commands, but with the kind of sword spirit that could directly talk...

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

and communicate there is still a noticeable gap between casual sword combat and combat in the system space, where this sword can't be used, but this system space is very convenient; any reward can be taken out and stored at any time. Even if you put it in a real battle, it can still serve a purpose. The enemy looks at Luu's hands, seeing nothing but the moment of engagement, yet they can immediately take out the sword and catch the opposite side off guard. Of course, such a tactic can only be used in the early stages, and its effect diminishes in the middle stages, and in the later stages, it's even less effective. 

After having lunch at home, Luu went to his master's house to practice. He wasn't going to say anything about the morning's cabinet participation, after all, it wasn't exactly a success story, and it wasn't worth bragging about at all. As a result, when they met, Xia Jian glanced at him and flirted with him by waving and pointing at the cabinet, reprimanding the cabinet members to their faces. It was really good, and powerful. Luu thought that his master, with such an indifferent personality, how could he still learn to be eerie. Luu wasn't surprised that Xia Jian knew about this, after all, many years ago, Xia Jian was the Grand Marshal who commanded all the armies of the Grand nation, and even though he had retired, and his power and influence were not as great as they used to be, it was naturally impossible for him to have no intelligence channels. 

Luu said with some depression, "Master, why are you still being sarcastic? A person who is a commander needs to consider all the circumstances before making his decision. What about you? Have you really considered it?" Xia Jian stared at him and asked lightly, "Luu, have you thought it through?" 

Luu lowered his head and responded, "No." Xia Jian said seriously, "It is not for the teacher to impose harshness, I just want you to understand. You say this in the cabinet today, there will be people to stop you, and you won't cause any serious consequences. Tomorrow, when you are in command of an army, any hasty decision may cause serious consequences. Since you know you didn't think it through, I won't say anything more. I just hope that something like this won't happen a second time."

Luu hastily nodded, "Yes." Obviously, different people have different opinions on this matter. From the view of the cabinet ministers, they felt that Luu's insights at a young age were really powerful, and one by one, they recognized him. However, in Xia Jian's opinion, this was not a qualified performance at all. Even if the ploy did have feasibility and was not something he had copied out of his head, but the reasoning behind it, and the other moments, had not been thought out clearly, and in this way, it was still unqualified.

Meanwhile, Xia Jing, who was on the side, couldn't help but stare with white eyes, looking at Xia Jian for a while and Luu for a while. His eyes were filled with curiosity; he wondered what was going on. Why did his own father reprimand Big Brother Luu, but the look on his father's face wasn't like that at all? The look clearly said that although you've done a good job, I want you to do better, and at this level, it's nowhere near enough. In this way, it seems that dad's demand for Big Brother Luu was unknown how much higher than his own.

The afternoon's cultivation was still boring, fortunately, Luu could clearly feel that he was slowly getting stronger. In this way, the originally boring training also seemed to become interesting. To use the game as an analogy, although cultivating the liver is hard work, there is an inexplicable sense of accomplishment when you see the progress bar slowly increase.

Luu was certainly clear that a normal cultivation would never be like this. How can anyone clearly feel their progress? Usually, it took 10 days and half a month of cultivation to make a tiny bit of progress, and that little bit of feeling had long since been buried in the drudgery of practicing situations like Luu's were few and far between.

This was the work of the Da embryo Dan, as well as the Dragon Tiger golden Dan, and the effect of that sword pool it. It was only then that Luu's cultivation progress became clearly felt. When the cultivation was over, Luu only felt that his stomach was empty and hungry. Fortunately, Xia Jian had ordered someone to prepare a meal a long time ago. Once on the table, Luu immediately feasted on the food; he's only three years old, but he's already eating like an adult.

Seeing this scene, Jia Jing, next to him, couldn't help but exclaim, "Big brother, you have a really good appetite." Luu smiled a little embarrassed by Xia Jing saying this, he also felt it. He was on his master's side, and his meals were several times larger than before. Obviously, in the middle of the day, you feel full after a few small bites, but at the end of the day, it's enough for two bowls of rice plus so many dishes. I'm afraid mom would be shocked if she found out that he could eat so much. Is this supposed to be a result of cultivation?

Xia Jian glanced at Luu, then glanced at Xia Jing and said, "Because of the fast progress in cultivation, that's why the amount of meals has increased. Your cultivation progress is so slow, so of course, you only eat this much every day."

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

It's that you eat too little," Xiao Jing said hurriedly, lowering his head in shame. "You shouldn't be eating too much, Master. You shouldn't be discouraged." Xiao Jing's expression conveyed a sense of embarrassment, and Master raised an eyebrow in response.

"Xiao Jing, you're destined to become the next 10rm Powerhouse," Master said, trying to reassure him. "You're not ordinary. Luu opened his mouth and said reassuringly. "Yes, Master. I won't give up."

Xiao Jing nodded, seemingly unaffected. The question of whether he could achieve the Marshall King realm in the future was still a big unknown. But Luu, on the other hand, was going to become a Marshall Saint, and so shouldn't he have a gap in his cultivation?

Xiaan Yuan glanced at Luu and was about to make a sarcastic remark when he suddenly realized something was off. He couldn't help but furrow his brows without hesitation. He directly released his Divine thoughts and, in just an instant, probed Luu's Dantian. What he saw made his brow furrow even more.

A small, golden sword had been born in Luu's Dantian. However, it was extremely small and its form was unstable, as if it might collapse at any moment. Still, this was considered a preliminary condensation of form, an entrance into the world of swordsmanship.

Xiaan Yuan's eyes widened as he sat down, entranced by the scene before him. He knew that Luu's talent for sword cultivation was exceptional, not at all comparable to ordinary cultivators. He also remembered that he, with Xiao Jing's help, had spent half a year before achieving a similar condensation and was still far from perfect.

Xiaan Yuan was impressed by Luu's speed, which was equivalent to condensing a golden sword within a month. However, Luu had only spent two or three days doing so. Xiaan Yuan, who had originally wanted to say something, was speechless. He was taken aback by Luu's incredible progress.

"You're a cultivation genius, Luu!" Xiaan Yuan exclaimed. Luu's eyes grew wide, and he felt a sense of pride. "I knew it. I'm a cultivation genius!" he said, laughing. "It's really true. Cultivation is a lot like chess, but to receive this praise from Master, it's all worth it."

However, before Luu could bask in the praise, Xiaan Yuan continued, "However, your progress is still too much. You want to take the Marshall Sage as your goal?" Xiaoan yuan's words struck a chord with Luu. He realized that he had been too hasty in his aspirations.

Xiaan Yuan approached him, his expression stern. "You need to work hard. Cultivation isn't a one-day effort. You need to be persistent."

Luu nodded, despite feeling a twinge of disappointment. Xiaan Yuan's words were laced with a hint of resentment, as if he felt Luu's rapid progress was not enough. Luu forced a smile, knowing that Xiaan Yuan was just trying to help.

After this, the lesson moved on to military affairs, which was undoubtedly more boring than cultivation. Xiao Jing sat in the back, listening intently as he felt the sky spinning from the sheer amount of information. However, he seemed to retain every word, his mind absorbing the knowledge like a sponge.

Luu, on the other hand, found his own pleasure in the lessons. He enjoyed the simulated war drills, where both sides simulated previous wars, and the sandbox environment was almost indistinguishable from reality. Luu also thought about various tactics, such as the sound of the East striking the West and using the Art of War. He even tried to apply some of his previous life's knowledge, like the golden cicada opening the road in the dark and the art of detouring.

However, when faced with the former Grand Sea Chief Marshall, Luu's tactics fell flat. The Marshall's movements were too smooth, and Luu's attempts at strategy were laughed off by his opponent. Luu realized his mistakes and began to think of new tactics.

Xiaan Yuan glanced at the time and said, "You should go home, Luu." "Hey, one more thing," Luu said, as he walked out. Xiaan Yuan turned to him and asked, "What's wrong, Luu?"

Despite his fondness for its unconquerable nature, Luu understood the reasoning behind tension and relaxation. His arm couldn't be bent, so he could only return home honestly, even with the S-Class Airship Polaris in charge of transportation. Although his itinerary wasn't a secret, not a single person dared to touch him. With the Aurora ship's defense, even if several Marshall Emperors came together, they wouldn't be able to do anything in a short period of time, even with the Aurora's firepower, it was possible to counterattack to some degree, ensuring safety.

Upon his return to the Marshall Saint residence, Bayu Yao looked at him and teased, "You're really a busy man. You're in the same mold as your father. I hardly see you a few times a day anymore." When Lua was by Bayu Yao's side, pestering her almost every day, Bayu Yao found him a bit annoying, but now that he wasn't home all day, she missed him a bit.

"Mom, if you miss me, just say so," Luu said with a smile. Bayu Yao replied, "I'm not going to the inner cabinet tomorrow, so I'll just stay home and play with you." Luu thought about it and said, "Anyway, the main quest of the inner cabinet had already been completed, so I don't have to go over there so diligently."

"Who wants you to play with me?" Bayu Yao rolled her eyes. "Mom, pride has retired its version. You have to be frank." This was a bit strange but not hard to understand. Bayu Yao froze for a moment and then reacted. She narrowed her eyes at this kid who dared to flirt with her. "It seems that he owes a beating."

Chapter 52: New Main Quest

Luu was lying on the bed, rambling with Bayu Yao about the events of the day. From the cabinet meeting in the morning to the cultivation in the afternoon to the military course in the evening and the war simulation sparring match at the end. Speaking of which, this was still Luu's first time to speak in the cabinet.

Thinking of a hit to solve the problem that everyone couldn't be solved, Luu thought, "Who can think of those old foxes one by one even hid so deep? Obviously, there has been a solution, but because of the interests of the relationship between each other to shift the blame, there is no hurry to solve the problem."

It was because of his own presence that things accelerated, and they immediately put together a reinforcement army from the East to this crisis. Bayu Yao listened attentively to Luu's narration and did not interrupt him. She could see that the reason Luu was angry was not his own failure but felt that these cabinet members were playing a game between each other, treating others as pawns, not realizing that in the big picture, they were just pawns. It's not their fault.

After waiting for Luu to finish speaking, Bayu Yao slowly said, "Our status as chess players was also just pushed out by others." Luu nodded with some disappointment and said slowly, "The nature of power is bottom-up. Power is often only responsible for the source of power."

Hearing this, Bayu Yao glanced at Luu with some surprise and couldn't help but silently recite in her heart, "The nature of power is bottom-up, but power is often only responsible for the source of the power. I have to say that's a really pithy summary." Being able to understand this, Luu had grown quite a bit in the cabinet.

Next, Luu talked about cultivation and military courses, and Bayu Yao listened equally attentively. Luu glanced at his quest panel in passing as he chatted. Now, the main quest, obtaining the approval of the cabinet members, was finally completed, and two side quests that were still missing the last stage to be completed were 100 companions' approval and obtaining a top-quality Heaven and Earth Treasure. The current progress was 72 out of 100, which was still quite a bit short, so it's good to know that there's still some time left.

As for the Phase 2 mission, bringing Cho Manam back to the human race, the mission reward was a natural ability sword, Da Tongin. This mission was a bit of a pain in the ass. Luu currently had no clue how to accomplish it. After all, the current Xiao Wuan hadn't rebelled against the human race yet, so how could they talk about bringing him back? This mission was simply a bug. No choice but to take a step forward.

Speaking of which, the next main quest hadn't appeared yet, and Luu wondered when it would come out. As if it could sense Luu's chanting, the system's Mission Interface surprisingly immediately appeared with a prompt: "Aha, what comes to mind, Lou youu?" Who was already a little sleepy and about to fall asleep immediately came to life. The system panel text slowly emerges due to your outstanding performance in the cabinet, you have received initial recognition from the leaders of the major factions who reluctantly agree that you have the identity of a chess player, but this alone is not enough. As the son of a martial arts Saint, it's good to know about politics, but it's not a good thing to be obsessed.

With a preoccupation with politics, it's not a beneficial focus during this time. As you dealt with political matters, you recalled past events from your youth. As the son of a marshal, you were once betrothed to a girl. Later, you chose to leave home due to a disagreement with your father, and the engagement was put on hold. At the time, you were young and impulsive, not giving much thought to the marriage contract, assuming it no longer mattered after your departure. Your father also wished to cancel the marriage, but you recently discovered that the girl from back then has been waiting for your return for 22 years. Now that you've returned, you aim to reconnect with her after all these years.

Mission Reward: Red Dust Sword Technique

Lou looked at the words in front of him, his small face filled with dismay. "Not cool, this quest is also messed up. I understand the marriage contract, I understand the girl who waited for me for 22 years, but can you at least give me the name of the other person? How do I know who the other person is if I don't have a name? How can I accomplish this task?" Lou couldn't help but wonder if his sister was doing this on purpose. He had relied on the system to arrive 40 years earlier, completing all sorts of tasks, and could be considered unbeatable. However, this task given by the system now, after 40 years, is relatively simple, even though the other side has waited for 22 years. At least, he knows who the other side is, unlike his current situation, where he feels like a headless fly looking at this task.

Lou pondered seriously. Logically speaking, to be able to make a marriage contract with the son of the Marshall Saint, the other party's life must not be simple. According to this condition, it should be possible to know the approximate range. The biggest worry now is that the other person isn't in Blue Star or even Boring yet, and that would be the end of it. This is the main quest, and if he gets stuck here, there's no way to complete any of the main quests after that. This won't work.

Thinking about this, Yu looked at Lou's pensive little face and couldn't help but ask with a smile, "What is Lu thinking about all day long?" Lou hesitated for a moment but still opened his mouth. "Mom, I have a question I want to ask you. Have you identified any future daughters-in-law? Are there a few favorites?" Yu's eyes widened in dismay, and her beautiful eyes looked at Lou incredulously. Before this, she would never have dreamed that Lou could even ask such a question. "How old is this guy? Three years old and he's already thinking of getting married. I know you're a big boy, but isn't it too soon?"

After a long time, Yu forced back her laughter and opened her mouth to ask, "Do you have a favorite little girl? Which one do you want to bring it back so that I can take a look for you?" Lou knew that Yu misunderstood, so he said in a serious manner, "I just want you, mom, to open up for me and see which girl I like." Yu couldn't help but spit out, "Four girls, don't you think it's too early?" Lou nodded and acknowledged this. If it wasn't for the mission, he would never have said those things. But for the sake of the mission, it can't be helped. Under his analysis, it was very likely that the future marriage contract would be arranged by Yu, his mother. If it was Lou's own object of choice, he certainly could not do the tedious operation of unplugging and turning his head to run. Mostly, it's the kind of political marriage where you haven't even seen your face a couple of times and don't have much of a relationship. It was still necessary to ask Yu's opinion at this moment. Lou racked his brain to think before speaking, "Everything in preparation is not a problem. Besides, I even went to the cabinet to participate in politics and spoke today. Even though it wasn't adopted, they all thought my ideas were good. Since I'm even in the cabinet for politics, it's not particularly early to talk about this marriage thing." That may sound like it makes sense, but when you think about it, it's really still who knows when.

Yu heard such words and actually nodded with approval. She thought for a moment and said, "I won't hide it from you. Privately, I did secretly identify a few little girls for you." Lou couldn't help but open his mouth when he heard this. This time, it was his turn to be shocked. Although this thing is his initiative, he never expected his mom to actually search for him. He is only three years old, after all. Now, considering these things is not too exaggerated. Terrible woman. Yu frowned when she heard Lou's words.

Surprised, these were the kid's words. He owes you a beating for trying to sneak up on you and lie to make you say such things. She knew it wasn't right, so she wasn't going to say anything, and she still ended up falling for the kid's trick. Bayu ya felt her hands itching a bit. If you don't fight for three days, you'll have to go up to your room, Luu had warned.

Luu had a bad feeling that his ass was going to be in trouble. He quickly explained, "I'm surprised, Bayyo stared at him with skeptical eyes. That tone just now didn't sound like a surprise, but rather like spitting. Which little girls are you talking about?"

"You want to know? Yuyo smiled.

"Ah, Luu nodded, not telling.

Yuyo laughed and then rolled over and went to sleep. When Luu saw this scene, he was a bit dumbfounded. You're such an adult, why are you still playing childish games, more childish than me, a child. But this was not difficult for Luu. Luu had his own way. He shook Yuya's arm and didn't let her sleep at all. After a while, Yuya couldn't stand the annoyance and opened her mouth.

"Listening to the names of those few Clans and a few girls, Lu you carefully memorized them. Do family, Do CH Yin Jang family, Snow by the river, SI family, SI chinga, Cho family, CH Ru. Is there more?" Luu asked.

"No more," Yuyo said, without a trace of anger. "This kid is really greedy. Is not enough. How many more do you want?"

Luu nodded. He planned to contact them one by one next to see if there were any Targets for the mission. If there was then naturally it would be great. If not, then it would be a problem and he would have to take his time to find it afterward.

Bayu ya looked at Luu's appearance as he carefully memorized the names and secretly calculated. She couldn't help but spit out, "I've never seen you like this. You're in a hurry to find a wife at such a young age. Do you know about the things between men and women?"

Lu you nodded. Yuyo, who had only made a casual remark, heard this and her face changed as she couldn't help but ask, "You know, how did you know?"

Lu you would like to say a few months ago there was a time when he woke up in the night and turned over in bed, and he just happened to see you and Dad doing that kind of thing. But he thought about it, it's a little bit bad to say so, after all, it's a private thing, even if he is childish, but it's not good. So he changed his mind and said, "holding hands and kissing mouths."

Hearing this, Yuya's heart that had been lifted was put down again. Small children are still cute. With a serious look on her face, she admonished, "Then you mustn't kiss on the mouth, or you'll have children and you'll be a father. Got it, Lu you?"

Luu was speechless. Seeing him with this expression, Yuya frowned, "Why do you have this expression? You don't need to tell me that I definitely know everything."

Luu said, "By the way, the few times I went to Master's home, I never saw Senior Maiden."

Hearing this, Byuga's face was a bit subtle. She thought for a moment and said, "Because your Senior Mother went to a place far, far away. Remember in the future, don't ever bring up the matter of your Senior Mother in front of your master."

Far, far away, Luu nodded. If anything, he had been a little curious before, but luckily he hadn't asked his master to his face.

Long time no see, the woman looked at Xia wuan and said gently, "Why are you here, Xiao wuan?"

Xiao wuan stared at the dignified and elegant woman in front of him and spoke with a complicated expression, "This is my home. I came back to see my child. Why can't I come?"

The woman sat on the edge of the bed and tenderly stroked Jing's head. Xiao Jing in his sleep seems to have a sense of originally tightly knit eyebrows but slowly stretching open. You crossed countless Star Realms to come here just to take a look at him.

Xiao wuan asked indifferently, "Of course not."

The woman raised her head and calmly looked at Xia wuan. "If you would have listened to me back then, then the current 10th realm Marshall Saint wouldn't be Li Chang xang, but you, Xiao wuan."

Xiao wuan raised his head and asked with an unchanged face, "Hm, the woman smiled charmingly and continued, "I came to find you in order to give you another chance to break through the 10th realm."

Hearing this, Xiao wuan, however, kept his face unchanged and let out a salty "Oh." He knows very well that everything has a price. As long as you can leave the human race and come to my side, I will ask the mother goddess to return that item to you and send you to the Abyssal land to try out, the woman said with a serious face. At that time, your breakthrough to the 10th realm will just be a matter of going along for the ride. As long as you break through the 10th realm, you can completely push for friendship between the human race and us. At that time, your reputation as a traitor to the human race can also be immediately vindicated and crowned as a hero once again.

There's no reason to hesitate, what are you waiting for? Listening to the woman's words, Jelan Yuan's face grew increasingly somber. Chapter 54: How Brave. Don't you know I have an S-Class ship? Jalan Yuan's lowered face caught the woman's continued speech. The Human Community has developed for so many years, yet it's now corrupt and filled with ills. If this continues, it'll be challenging to return from the accumulation of heavy weights, and annihilation will be just a few hundred years away. If it weren't for Lu Chang's appearance, the current human race would have long entered its twilight days. His appearance propelled the human race to the top, but it also made them the Public Enemy of all races. He's supposed to be the salvation of humanity, yet he's only maintained the status quo. How ridiculous is that?

The human race needs a change agent like you, but you've fallen to this. Not only have they stripped you of your power, but they've also erased your past merits, making people forget your contributions and only know you as a peak Marshal Emperor. A human race like this isn't worth keeping. Leave with me, and after you break through the 10th realm, you can come back to change everything. It's not too late.

Ja Lan Yuan's complexion remained unchanged as he listened to the woman's provocative words. Having grown so much, he knew there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. Song Chan Xiao Wan slowly raised her head, and the woman's reaction noticeably slowed when she heard the long-lost human name. If you were sincere, you wouldn't have come with an avatar. Ja Lan Yuan let out a cold laugh and unflinchingly asked, "Are you afraid I'll catch your original body?"

Upon hearing this, Son Chan's face stiffened, showing some dissatisfaction. Xiao Wan Yuan, don't go too far. I've already given you another chance. I'll wait for your original body to come before me, and at that point, I might consider it.

Ja Lan Yuan narrowed his eyes and spoke indifferently. He didn't give Son Chan a chance to speak and, with a snap of his fingers, Son Chan's figure gradually dissipated into thin air.

In a secret place, Son Chan's face was ugly. "Failed, damn it! How dare you dispel me straight away?" Xiao Wan Yuan, don't think you've fallen this far. What's left of this human race worth staying in? Since you're so heartless towards me, don't blame me for forcing you to make a decision.

Son Chan spoke fiercely as she stared at the information in front of her. It depicted a tender child, the son of Marshal Saint Lu Chang. Xang Lu U was also the current decoy of Xiaan Yuan. If he had an accident on the way to Xiaan Yuan, Xiaan Yuan would be afraid that he couldn't wash away even if he jumped into the Yellow River. Only then would forcing him in this way backfire. If Luu had an accident, it would also make the Marshal Saint furious, with unimaginable consequences. It would be best to use Luu's little life as a threat to make Xia Wan defect to the human race.

Son Chan carefully examined the intelligence, and her face changed slightly. Worthy of being the son of a Marshal Saint, he even had an S-Class airship escorting him throughout his journey. An S-Class spaceship - even if she went all out, she couldn't break the ship's defense. Moreover, Blue Star was the home base of the human race, and any slight difference here would be detected by the celestial worker intelligence. With Luu's status and position, countless supports would immediately come. Therefore, trying to rob the son of the Marshal Saint by force was almost a daydream.

Good, the other party is just a three-year-old child. Even if direct action isn't possible, coaxing the other party to open the door might work. My clan is best at the art of change, which isn't just about changing the shape of your flesh. As your strength increases, the art of change increases as well. With enough materials, your breath, your Ires, or your DNA can be perfectly replicated. Of course, the strength can't be duplicated, and the moment you do it, you'll reveal yourself. But it's enough. Son Chan was very confident about this. Even if this Luu is smart, he's just a three-year-old. It's still easy to trick him with my understanding of Xiaan Yuan and these materials in my hands. Turning into his appearance, as long as I don't do anything, I can barely find any cracks. This way, it won't cause any commotion. Even Luu won't realize from start to finish that I'm not his master. Use him as blackmail to force Yaia when you want to leave the human race, then send Lu back. From start to finish, without alerting anyone, onlookers might even think that he, Xia Wan, rebelled against the human race on his own.

The following day, Luu contacted his gold medal Junior, Yanching, and asked him to help collect details about those four little girls, focusing on not alarming them and sending the information to himself first. Yuguan Ching was a bit surprised by his big brother's task but didn't think much of it and immediately went to do it.

Brother didn't care much about things, but today's Heroes of Dashia circle has been considered very powerful. This small matter is naturally not a problem because Luu wasn't going to the cabinet today. Time became plentiful, so Luu decided to go to his master's house early and then take some time out to organize another Hero's conference. In fact, he wanted to hold it outside, but considering that it was not safe outside, he thought better of it. If something really happened, it would definitely not be a small matter, so it was better to be careful. Lu was very satisfied with his identity as the only son of the Marshall Saint, but because of this, he couldn't go wherever he wanted like an ordinary child. Even if you go to your Master's house, you have to ride the entire time in an S-Class Airship and you can't get off the Airship to play in the middle of the trip. But it can't be helped. Who made him the only son of the Marshall Saint with all the conveniences and benefits that you get there is definitely a corresponding bad side. It's pretentious if you have to complain about that after having breakfast and playing games with his mom for a while, Luu boarded the Polaris and headed to his master's home.
At the moment, the Airship was flying at an even speed and since it was flying on the surface, it wasn't too fast. So, Luu could lie down by the window and take a good look at the scenery. Just then, the ship was intercepted and came to a violent stop.
"What's the situation, Luu?" he hastily glanced at the large screen of the center control. In the sky, there was a figure that was clearly Xiao Wuan, Master Lu's disciple. Luu couldn't help but be a little surprised. "Why did Master appear here, Jau Wuan?"

Jau Wuan looked at Luu with a calm expression and opened his mouth lightly. His voice directly transmitted in. "Today is a day off. Cultivation is suspended. Let's go. I'll take you to an interesting place to play and relax."
Combining work and rest, where's Xiao Jing? Luu froze for a moment and subconsciously asked.
"Heun's already passed," Xiao Wuan continued. "Just waiting for you."
This way, ah Luu nodded but in his heart, he was a little suspicious, feeling that something was wrong. This person in front of him was he really the master? True or false? Just try it and see.
"You raised your head and rushed to the center control intelligence and ordered, 'Convert to attack mode. Attack the Target in front immediately.' The ship's intelligence responded indifferently, 'Attack Mode has been switched. High energy particle cannons activated. Target locked.' Only to see that countless points of red light were converging in the two flanks of the Polaris. In the mouths of one of the black holes of the Cannons, seeing this scene, Jau Wuan and face changed drastically. They discovered why was it discovered without the slightest hesitation?
This Joe, when youan, turned around and ran. Seeing this scene, Luu knew that his guess was correct. Whom trying to escape? You can outrun an S-Class spaceship, can you outrun a high energy particle cannon? That's Brave! Didn't you know I had an S-Class ship?"
Chapter 55: At a young age, the mind is meticulous, and the hand is vicious. Generally speaking, S-Class airships were targeted at the strongest of the Marshall Emperor realm, trying to build an S-Class Airship often required the investment of vast amounts of resources and money. And many strong Marshal Emperors without family lineage could not afford to get an S-Class Airship. Out just by themselves, one S-Class Airship was all they had, which was really not worth it. And it would be better to continue using A-Class airships. Therefore, in Dashia and even the entire human Community, an S-Class Airship was undoubtedly a symbol of identity and status. But for Marshall St. L Chong Shang, an ordinary S-Class Airship was nothing at all. And he had specially built this Polaris, which was far superior to ordinary S-Class airships in terms of both defense and attacking capabilities. If it was strictly defined, it should be named a super S-Class ship or an SS-Class ship. The highest grade on the market is the S-grade, but as it turns out, there's a difference between an S-Class ship and an S-Class ship. The terrifying power of these high energy particle cannons, which instantly emitted a torrent of high energy particles, was such that according to pops, even a marshall Emperor realm Powerhouse would have to avoid it. Although they weren't life-threatening to a marshall Emperor realm Powerhouse, if they hit, they could still cause a marshall Emperor to be in a bit of a mess. As for a strong person in the Marshall King realm, if they were hit multiple times, they would have to be seriously injured. Only pops also said that it wasn't that simple to hit a strong person above the Marshall King realm, and with their initial Mastery of the power of rules, the ship couldn't lock onto them. And this person disguised as his teacher, Xiao Wuan, was obviously not a strong Marshal Emperor realm, not even a marshall King realm. And according to the evaluation data given by the Intelligence Center control, his strength was probably between the Grand Master and Marshall King Realms. In other words, the peak of the seventh realm or even quasi Marshall King. On top of this blue star, it was barely considered a Powerhouse. It was only a Pity that he had encountered Luu in his super S-Class ship, and it was simply a Fool's errand to think of escaping without becoming an eighth realm Powerhouse and mastering the power of rules. Go to hell.

To condense into a Dharma phase, his battle power was greatly increased. In the Seventh Realm, a Great Master Powerhouse like Marshal Da could transform his phantom into his own domain, known as a domain powerhouse. If pulled into the realm, the Grandmaster would have an advantage over the patriarch, as the two were not on the same level. The man disguised as a teacher, facing the threat of the high-energy particle cannon, frantically opened his domain to block the attack. Buzz, buzz, a torrent of particles mercilessly destroyed his domain, shattering it in an instant. The domain was an extension of the body's consciousness, and when destroyed to such an extent, it was detrimental to the self. Jia Wuan was spitting blood, his gaze towards Luu's side a stare of disbelief. He never imagined a three-year-old child would be so vigilant. It was fine to be vigilant if spotted, but who would have thought Luu would directly activate the high-energy particle cannon and bombard her continuously. A look of immortality, "Isn't it because I'm wearing your Master's face now? Do you and your master have some deep grudge? That's too harsh, aren't you afraid of what might happen?" Buzz, another round of high-energy particles blasted over, and with the remnants of his domain, Son Chan narrowly dodged it. A fiery touch came from half her body, almost killing her. If the field hadn't opened fast enough, she would have been dead. Now, with the shattering of the domain, she was already dying. "You can't kill me!" Son Chan's eyes whitened as she shouted, "Luu, you heard this, but don't hesitate to fire. Why not? When you pretended to be a master before and planned to trick me into opening the door, weren't you mentally prepared to die? This is the first time Luu has encountered an attack, and although the other party hasn't made a move, technically, it is considered an attack. Not far away, Son Chan, struggling to hold on to the tattered domain, still wanted to beg for mercy, but what responded was a relentless blast of high-energy particle artillery. Buzz, a torrent of high-energy particles hit the field, continuously dismembering it, making it ineffective. It was even more difficult for Son Chan to resist, and she was instantly hit by a frontal blast, half her body turning into charcoal. She fell from the air like a bird hit. Luu watched the scene with interest and commented, "It's really worthy of a Grandmaster's physical strength. It's really hard. I thought it would be completely annihilated at the Fifth Realm. In the Sixth Realm, the martial artist forges a golden body, and in the Seventh Realm, the strength of the golden body continues to increase with the realm. If it reaches the Eighth Realm, the Ninth Realm, it can almost be hardened against high-energy particle cannons with its physical body. The human body is still marvelous, but this guy is too weak. One hit from a high-energy particle cannon, and he's on the verge of death. Or maybe he's playing dead. Really think I'm a child first, then play dead. Fire, keep firing." Luu did not hesitate and immediately gave the order. Not far away, Son Chan, pretending to be dead, fell from the air, flying down like a corpse. But she didn't feel any hint that danger was moving away. Her premonition of life and death grew stronger with the elevation of the realm. In battle, a strong person's sixth sense would be infinitely amplified, especially in moments of life and death. At this moment, Son Chan's scalp tingled. "Damn little thing, this is to drive out the whole world. So young, so thoughtful, so vicious. What a monster." On the verge of death, Son Chan had no means left. If she didn't think of a way out, she would really die. She once again supported the tattered domain and frantically dodged the torrent of particles. Then, she raised her head and shouted at the airship, "I'm your Master's wife, Xiao Jing's mother. You can't kill me in the middle of the airship." Luu heard the words and froze slightly. He couldn't help but furrow his brows. "Xiao Jing's mom, Master's wife. She didn't die a long time ago. I can't believe you're trying to trick me." Damn it, man, keep firing. After Son Chan shouted these words, she almost cried out when she saw the crisis was not lifted. "I didn't lie to you. Don't kill me. You can't kill me." She was going to break down. This kid can't be bothered with oil and salt. He's determined to kill himself. Is it that big of a deal? Buzz, another high-energy particle cannon blasted over, directly penetrating Son Chan's body. Luu calmly watched the scene and, after thinking about it, made a communication call to his master. The communication was quickly picked up, and Xia Wuan looked at him calmly. "What's wrong?" Luu thought for a moment and opened his mouth, "Master, just now, a person disguised as you tried to trick me into opening the door of the airship."

When these words left his mouth, Xia Wanan burst into flames. He quickly shouted, "Don't open the door! Don't open the door!"

**Chapter 56: Who Can Bear the Wrath of a Martial Saint**

Time moved forward a little. Xiao Jing was eating breakfast at home. As he ate, he watched his father carefully. Though weak and timid, Xiao Jing was very observant. Since he had woken up that morning, he had noticed that his father's face didn't look quite right, and he had a preoccupied look on his face. In the past, there were times when his father had something on his mind, but it was definitely not what it was now. Xiao Jing couldn't quite describe it, but it just wasn't the same.

After hesitating for a long time, Xiao Jing mustered up the courage to open his mouth and ask, "Dad, do you have something on your mind? Can you talk to me about it?"

Hearing this, Xia Wanan was stunned. He subconsciously touched his face and asked with some surprise, "Is it that obvious?"

"It's not that obvious," Xiao Jing answered, "but I can tell."

"This matter is better left unsaid," Xia Wanan shook his head and slowly spoke.

The surge of courage that Xiao Jing had just summoned up was only enough for him to ask, but not enough for him to continue pursuing the question, so he didn't press further.

Xia Wanan looked at Xiao Jing with a complex expression and a heavy heart. He had been thinking about that question since last night until now. Song Chan's words last night had indeed touched him. At this stage, the only way for him to have a glimmer of hope of breaking through to the 10th rank was to leave the human race. He likewise understood that everything had a price, and the same was true for obtaining the opportunity to break through to the 10th rank. This trip to the False Transformation Race's star territory was mostly dangerous, and even with Song Chan's assurance, it couldn't really be safe. It would be a fool's errand to believe her. Xia Wanan, who had seen a lot of things, naturally wouldn't be like that. His own danger was nothing to him. He had broken through all the way to Human Emperor and had long since experienced countless life-and-death crises. It was normal for martial artists to die in the middle of an adventure, wasn't it?

It was just that he had his own concerns. For one thing, Xiao Jing hadn't grown up yet. Without his shelter, with Xiao Jing's status and his character, he was afraid that he would live a very miserable life. Even with Lu Changshing's care, it was probably not much better. After all, he had to carry the title of son of a betrayer. In addition, he hadn't taught Lu You much. This child was naturally intelligent. His talent in the way of the sword was even more exaggerated than his own. He was equally interested in military art and had great ambitions. And although he was still a bit naive and cute, his heart of a bear child was enough to make anyone falter. Even Xia Wanan was no exception. Before that, he had clearly stopped trusting anyone, even that Lu Changshing. But after meeting Lu You and seeing his ambition, Xia Wanan was slightly shaken. The day he formally paid his respects, he and Lu You argued for a long time until Lu You said, "So you want to rebel against the human community?" Only then did Xia Wanan gradually calm down.

At that time, Xia Wanan found the words somewhat inexplicable. Last night, when he talked to Song Chan, Xia Wanan was somewhat moved by the words and was a bit foolish inside. Suddenly, he remembered Lu You's words again, "So you want to rebel against the human community?" At that time, Xia Wanan was much more awake at once and directly dispersed Song Chan's avatar. But his heart had been spoken for, and that was a fact that could not be changed. This made Xia Wanan torn and has been torn until now.

Just then, a communication call came in. When Xia Wanan saw that it was Lu You, he didn't hesitate and directly connected. Then, to his dismay, he heard that someone had disguised themselves to trick Lu You into opening the airship door. Xia Wanan instantly realized what it was and stared incredulously, his eyes narrowing a bit. "How did she think? How dare she? How dare she hit Lu You's body with her idea?" In an instant, Xia Wanan guessed Song Chan's idea of using Lu You and coercing him to leave the human race.

"Don't open the door! Don't open the door!" Xia Wanan shouted out in a hurry and then, with hardly any hesitation, instantly left his home to find Lu You.

Hearing this, Lu You on the screen nodded and said, "Of course, I didn't open the door. That's good."

Xia Wanan was slightly relieved. With the defense of an S-Class ship, Song Chan wouldn't be able to open the ship for a while even if she called someone over. "Wait for me to arrive, I'll be right over," Xia Wanan said in a hurry.

"It's fine. The other party seems to be just one person, and they've already been killed by me," Lu You continued.

When Xia Wanan heard this, his face turned odd, and he asked with some disbelief, "What did you say? She's dead already? Killed by you?"

In the Polaris spacecraft, Lu You's heart thumped as he looked at his master's odd face. "That guy can't really be Master's wife, can he?"

"Are you serious?"

"Well, that's awkward. When you see your good buddy Xiao Jing in the future, how can you get along?"

Here is a rewritten version of the text with improvements to the English while maintaining the original meaning:

As Luu was about to kill his mother, a string of data arrived from the Intelligence Center control. The target still showed signs of life, but he was no longer able to resist or escape. "Should we continue the attack to kill the target completely?" the intelligence officer asked. However, Luu quickly responded, "Hold off on attacking! He still has a last breath left, Teacher, please come over quickly. I'll send you the coordinates right away."

Xia Wuan received the coordinates and didn't hesitate, speeding towards the location immediately. Meanwhile, the skyworks intelligence monitor on the planet outside of the Blue Planet had been tracking the battle taking place in the stratosphere. A stream of high-energy particles had moved so much that it split the clouds directly, making it hard to ignore. The celestial intelligence immediately uploaded a series of information, including the S-Class ship of Luu, the Polaris.

Not long after, By Yuyo received a message that Luu was suspected to have been attacked. She, usually gentle as water, suddenly felt cold, and her voice became murderous. Her companions around her shivered in response. A big incident had occurred within a certain radius, and all the Marshall Emperors and Marshal Kings moved out immediately, providing fire support. Although By Yuyo was kind to people and didn't like to participate in politics, her realm was vast, making her a powerful Grandmaster who could be easily underestimated. However, she had another identity - the supreme power that came with the title, even if she rarely used it. At this moment, that power was all too clear.

The Marshall King reporting the news with By Yuyo felt a tremor in his heart when he heard the news. If Luu had indeed been attacked, the consequences would be unimaginable, and who could bear the wrath of the Marshall Saint?

Within just 5 minutes from Luu's attack, the top echelons of the Blue Planet were shaken. The martial kings and martial emperors were all confused when they heard the news. "Who are you saying was attacked?" "The only son of the Sage of Wushu? This is the Blue Planet, the Imperial Star of Dasha, and the home base of the human community. How could we be attacked here? Who would have the guts to risk their lives? Those foreigners, even if they were crazy, wouldn't do something like this!"

One was shocked and felt that the news was unbelievable, but no one took it as a joke. Since the order had been conveyed, they had to go out and provide support. You can't give face to the Marshall Saint, but you also can't give face to anyone else when it comes to the Marshall Saint. As a result, a group of Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors powerhouses rushed into the sky and flew towards the location of the coordinates.

The first to arrive was Xia Wuan. He immediately saw the dying Song Chan and Lu Ching's S-Class ship, Luou. Luu was very vigilant and didn't come out of the airship, even when another master arrived. "Maybe it's still fake," he thought. "Maybe he's trying to trick me out." However, after Xia Wuan came over, he didn't talk to him much less trick him.

Xia Wuan looked at Song Chan on the ground with a complicated expression. "Why bother?" he spoke slowly. Song Chan, severely injured and on the verge of death, raised his head with difficulty and slowly glanced at Xia Wuan. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but coughed up a mouthful of blood instead. "Actually, I...I had already been moved by your words...Xia Wuan," he said. "But I don't want to leave right now. Maybe wait for a few more years, 10 more years, and when Xiao Jing and Luu are a bit older, I'll leave the human race to take a risk and wrestle with the possibility of a tenth realm."

"What's stupid," Xia Wuan said, "is that a three-year-old could even see the cracks and be okay. You alive? Stupid woman! You said in the first place why didn't I see the cracking you? Maybe I've seen it and just don't want to admit it."

In the Polaris spacecraft, Louie looked at the scene not far away and didn't hear what his master was saying. The Master's face on the center screen seemed to be very bad. "Is this woman really the Master's wife?" Louie thought. "Then why did she do it to herself?" Louie frowned and pondered some fragmented information from the past, which was finally strung together at this moment. "Why would Master rebel against the human community in the future? I'm afraid that there is a small connection with this teacher's wife. Is there a possibility that she is not human at all, but rather a foreigner?"

Had he gone to a faraway place, where the Fay lived at that time, Luu didn't think much of it and believed it to be dead. However, it turned out that it was actually very far away, physically speaking. Previously, when he stayed at his master's house, Luu could clearly feel that his master's attitude toward Xiao Jing was very strange. It wasn't that bad, but more often than not, there was a very complex emotion in it. All of this seems to be explained now. Xiao Jing turned out to be the crystallization of a Fay and a human. Treating such a son, Jaia was like a peculiar, complicated mixture - Yuan's emotions were naturally complicated, no wonder Jaia had few friends despite being the son of a peak Marshal Emperor. This result was not the result of mere introversion and fear of life; others would take the initiative to flatter him, and there was no need for him to take the initiative at all. Looking at it again, it wasn't that the kids didn't want to touch Xiao Jing, but they didn't dare. Obviously, they had all been instructed by their families. However, Luu's appearance with his status and position eliminated those scruples, and he directly pulled Xiao Jing into the circle of great summer Heroes. It's like this. Luu nodded thoughtfully, then looked at the picture in the screen. "I wonder now what will you do, Master?" Luu realized that he was afraid that this was the key to that side quest, Phase 2 mission, bringing Cho Manam back to the human race. Quest reward: natural ability, sword Da Tongin. At this very moment, Jalan Yuan's Choice mostly determined the direction of the Mission. It's up to Master's Choice. Luu stared at the screen in the meantime. Not far, Song Chan, who was paralyzed on the ground, lifted her head with difficulty and said two words, very reluctantly, "Save me, save you." When Xia Wuan heard this, he looked at her with an odd expression on his face. "I already spared you once, back then," he said. "Do you still remember what the Mi of back then said? I said, 'Don't come back, don't show your face again.' Even though the price was heavy back then, I still let you go. But you don't seem to value that opportunity this time. Even tried to attack my disciples, you should know better than anyone the weight of his identity, the Heavenly worker's intelligence should have detected all of this, and now there should be a lot of Marshall Kings and martial Emperors rushing here. They definitely won't kill you, but rather they will strip your body consciousness and soul one by one, one by one, and then find out everything you know. All of it." After all, we are husband and wife. I don't want to make a mess, so it's better to let me kill you, Song Chan, who was lying on the ground heard these words and slowly sighed, slowly closed her eyes. Xia Wuan no longer hesitated and simply waved his hand casually, and Song Chan's body was instantly like a burnt-out straw breaking apart in an instant and completely turning into flying ash. It was only at this time that a Marshal Emperor arrived late, "Sword Emperor, please don't kill her." When Xiao Wuan heard this, he glanced at the visitor and let out a cold snort. Then, directly left Woi. Looking at the flying ash in the sky, he helplessly frowned. "Surprisingly killed how should this be explained?" This attack naturally cannot just safely protect Luu; even if the end, but also the identity of the attacker, to find out would be all the causes and consequences, all investigated to be considered complete. It's just that the other party has already turned into flying ash and his Godly form has been destroyed, so how can he still investigate? Many Marshal Emperors and Marshall Kings came one after another. After Wuin explained the situation, the crowd furled their brows in some dissatisfaction. Only with Sword Emperor Xiao, when you acted like this, I'm afraid that this matter isn't that simple. 

Chapter 58, a conversation between men inside the Polaris spacecraft, Lou witnessed the whole process. The moment he saw Xia Wuan on strike, he couldn't help but widen his eyes. It wasn't that he was surprised by his Master's ruthlessness, but he was marveling at the fact that the Sword move was exquisite. Although he had only begun practicing for a short time, thanks to the gift of the system, Luu had obtained the talent of natural sword intent and natural sword heart. Understanding so he could naturally see the extraordinary nature of this sword. If I had to describe it in two words, it would be "perfect." What a perfect sword. It's so pleasing to the eye. Luu couldn't help but think to himself, "I wonder when I'll be able to use a sword as well." Just then, a prompt suddenly appeared before Luu's eyes, it was exactly the same as his expected guess. Jalan Yuan's Choice directly determined the direction of this Mission. If Jaan Yuan was going to force-fully keep her alive at the expense of making an enemy of the entire human race, then this Mission would not be accomplished. However, if Jalan Yuan made a choice, then there was hope for completion. On the system panel, the text slowly emerged. "Mission accomplished, you have successfully brought your Master Xiaan back to the human race. Quest reward: natural ability sword Da Tong shin has been issued. This instant, Luu could clearly feel that he had gained an additional extremely subtle ability. This would be the sword way to God."

Simultaneously, on the system panel, a line of small words appeared, providing a comprehensive response to the Talent's sword, which was a remarkably unique natural ability. Upon activation, it could continuously draw power from the universe and the void, enhancing the sword's might. However, it was crucial to note that the sword's Da Rule Powers did not belong to the wielder, and forcibly integrating them into one's body would cause damage to both the physical body and spirit. The stronger the Rule Power absorbed, the greater the damage sustained. This move was undeniably lethal, inflicting a thousand times the damage on the enemy while causing self-harm 800 times.

Unlike ordinary abilities, the upper limit of the sword Da Tonin was exceptionally high. If one absorbed the power of the rules without restraint, it was possible to perform a move that surpassed the limit, though the cost would be one's life. This risky innate ability had another benefit: it allowed the wielder to tap into the power of unknown sword Da Rule Powers and use a dangerous method to rapidly grow in strength.

Luu furrowed his brows as he read the introduction of this natural ability. Unlike the previous one, this ability had a surprising drawback. However, the ceiling was extremely high. Directly absorbing the power of the sword Da Rule's sixth realm Dharma phase, seventh realm domain, and eighth realm would involve the power of rules, but only tentatively. It was only at the ninth realm that one could be considered to have ascended, making this ability undoubtedly the highest-ranked reward Luu had received so far.

Despite the negative effects, overall, the flaws made this ability quite counterintuitive. If Luu were given a counterintuitive skill that was directly invincible and didn't require any cost, he would likely question if this was a system conspiracy.

Suddenly, Bayu Ya appeared not far away. As Bayu Ya approached the Polaris, the hatch slowly opened, and after Bayu Ya entered, she let out a sigh of relief upon seeing Luu safe and sound. The coldness and sternness on Bayu Ya's face instantly disappeared, replaced by her usual gentleness. She looked at Luu, squatted down, and grabbed his hand.

"I'm coming. Don't be afraid. You won't be in any danger," Bayu Ya said. Luu couldn't help but blink when he heard this. Scared? Dangerous? It shouldn't be me, should it? Luu raised his head and said with a smile, "Mom, you're underestimating me too much. Just now, that person came over without knowing what to do and had already been ordered to attack by me. Directly blasting him half dead, he was then killed by the master who rushed over."

Bayu Ya nodded, understanding what was going on. "Of course, I'm well aware that this one Polaris ship's defense ability, as well as its attacking ability, is not something that can be compared to an ordinary S-Class ship. This was a surprise attack against Luu, so how could I dare to take it lightly. What if there really was a foreign race that didn't know how to die and spent a lot of money on a surprise attack? The probability is low, but I don't dare to bet on it. Go home first, Bayu Ya stroked his head. Luu thought about it but shook his head. "I want to go to the teacher's side first."

Bayu Ya looked at him with some doubt. "This matter and the teacher have a certain relationship, but please do not blame him. He has already made a move to kill the person who disguised himself. That person may still be the teacher's mother, so Luu opened his mouth to explain.

"I see," Bayu Ya's reaction was quick, understanding what was going on. Then she nodded and said, "Then I'll accompany you over there. I want to go there by myself."

"Because it's a conversation between men, mom. Just relax. Then it's okay if I don't get off the ship," Luu said. Bayu Ya nodded, and Luu had no choice but to comply. After all, he had just suffered an attack. Bayu Ya was definitely not willing to let him leave alone, which was normal.

Luu continued to rush to the master's home. Although it wasn't Luu who personally killed his master's wife, this matter couldn't be separated from him. But to forcefully attribute the fault to him would be the theory of the victim's guilt. Now, no matter what, Senior Nang was finally dead, or Master Xiao when Yuan's hand. It was kind of forcing the master to make a choice. At this moment, Master's feelings were probably very complicated. However, the mission was completed, indicating that he would not leave the human race in the future with a high probability, which was undoubtedly a good thing. He had completed his mission, and his master cut off contact with the Fay, only pitying Xiao Jing who has been without a mother ever since.

Not long after Luu arrived at Xiaan Yuan's house and met a bewildered Xiao Jing.

When Jing saw Luu, he opened his mouth and asked, "What happened?" Luu couldn't answer, as his mom was gone. He avoided the question somewhat sheepishly and opened his mouth to ask, "Where is the master in the 10,000 Swords Pavilion?" Xiao Jing replied, "The 10,000 Swords Pavilion." Luu was a bit surprised, then continued to ask, "Can you take me there?" Xiao Jing nodded and directly began to lead the way.

Luu's family had a 10,000 Law Building, and he didn't realize that on the Master's side of the family, there was also a 10,000 Sword Pavilion, and even the naming style was the same. Not long after, Luu followed Xiao Jing to the 10,000 Swords Pavilion. This 10,000 Swords Pavilion obviously would not be as grand as the 10,000 Laws Building. Luu turned to Xiao Jing and said, "I'll go over and take a look. Wait for me here." Xiao Jing was very well-behaved and didn't ask why, nodding in response.

Chapter 59: "You don't even have the confidence to open up. How dare you say you're open?" Luu quickly ran over and pushed the door open with force. Only a squeak was heard, and the heavy door was slowly pushed open. Normally, this gate was rarely opened, mostly entered through the side door, which made a not inconsiderable noise when it was open because it hadn't been maintained much. At this moment, not far behind Xiao Jing saw Luu pushing the gate and just wanted to open his mouth to speak that the gate could not be pushed open. The next moment, he saw Luu pushing open that huge gate and could not help but be jaw-dropped. "Big Brother's strength but also really big. A such a big door actually a push to open," Xiao Jing couldn't help but sigh.

Luu, on the other hand, didn't think much of it and looked up inside the doors pushed open, and dust flew freely under the sunlight. What came into view was a vast area of Dojo with the ground paved by neatly laid green stone tiles. Strangely enough, there was not a single sword in this 10,000 Swords Pavilion. It was just a futon placed randomly on the ground in the middle of this Dojo sat a man who was clearly Master Xiaan Yan. "Master Xiaan Yan, I'm coming," Luu opened his mouth. Xia Wanyuan didn't say anything and didn't even move. Luu hesitated but walked in.

When Luu's paw stepped on the ground of the 10,000 Swords Pavilion, he could instantly feel a sharp thrill surging up from the soles of his feet. This is sword intent. Luu was a bit surprised, as the possessor of the innate sword intent. Luu was more than familiar with it. Next, with every step he took, he could feel different sharp stimulating sensations, and they originated from a variety of completely different sword intentions. Until this moment, Luu finally realized why this 10,000 Swords Pavilion was named 10,000 Swords Pavilion but did not have a single sword.

After taking a dozen or so steps forward, the excitement was obviously a little stronger, and the concentration of Sword intent was also a lot stronger. If Luu did not possess the innate sword intent as well as the innate sword mind enlightenment, he would have been paralyzed in place. Next, with every step Luu took, the sword intent became a little more terrifying, and the sense of excitement became more intense. After taking another dozen or so steps, feeling the terrifying sword intent that was like an ocean, Luu's forehead couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. This 10,000 Swords Pavilion, it's really not simple.

After a few more steps, Luu felt like he was going to be unable to support himself. Despite his talent, he was ultimately too weak. Just then, he saw a futon next to him and without much thought, hurriedly sat down. Sitting on this futon, that monstrous sword intent was indeed alleviated quite a bit. At this moment, it felt like sitting on a small boat. Although it was swaying with the waves, at least it didn't have to face the raging waves directly. He sort of got a break and was able to breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief. Up to this point, Jia Wanan is still 30 or 40 steps away from his position. It seemed almost impossible for him to walk there in the meantime.

Outside the house, thanks to the door being pushed open, Xiao Jing standing at a distance could clearly see inside. When he saw Luu walk toward the front, he recited in his mind, "One step, two steps, three steps," in the count to nine steps. Jia Jing's face was written with surprise. Although he knows that big brother Luu is very powerful, he has only begun to cultivate. This will be able to walk to the ninth step. However, he proved to be surprised too soon. He only saw Luu continue to walk inside and in a flash, he reached 20 paces. Jia Jing subconsciously held his breath as he continued to count Luu's footsteps, 29, 30, 31, 32, all the way to 32 steps. Luu's tiny body was shaky, and he hurriedly found a futon to sit down.

Thirty-two steps. Xiao Jing was horrified in his heart and could no longer use words to describe his feelings at this moment. Even though he had known for a long time that his elder brother was a genius, even the genius of geniuses, seeing this scene still made him realize the cruelty of this world. He had cultivated until now and, after grinding in the 10,000 Swords Pavilion for so long, he was merely able to take only six steps forward. Big brother, who was coming over for the first time, managed to take 32 steps. Father used to say, "Within 10 paces, a beginner in Sword intent."

Within twenty paces, an executioner of Sword intent; within thirty paces, an Adept of Sword intent. At that time, Xiao Jing asked, "What about after thirty paces?" Jia Yuan's reply was, "That's not something you need to consider."

Xiao Jing asked innocently, "If I walk slowly and take only one-tenth of each step, won't I be able to walk thirty steps later?" Jia Yuan glanced at him and directly cut off his fantasies. "The 10,000 Swords Pavilion only looks at the number of steps you take, and it has nothing to do with how long you take to do so. There are no bugs here."

Leu did not know how much of a shock he had brought to Xiao Jing's young mind by taking those 32 steps. He looked up at Jia Yuan, who was not far away, and thought for a moment before speaking, "Master, though I don't know what to say or how I can comfort you, I think that every generation has its own mission, its own responsibility, and its own business. No one can master a generation's plan, not even your father. You've done enough. You used to support the backbone of the human race; now, you should take a little rest. You can stop working so hard."

Hearing this, Jia Yuan finally opened his eyes. "Sure enough, as Lu, you had guessed. A ruthless person like Sha Wuan would not hide here to grieve and cry just because of the death of a foreign woman. He is worried about missing the opportunity to break through the 10th realm and not being able to bring change to the human race again."

Lu looked at Jia Yuan seriously. "Of course, I know that the human race is riddled with ills, and I also know that the human race is a public enemy in the universe. Under internal and external troubles, it can be described as being in a state of turmoil. Even in the depths of the universe, there may still be more powerful threats. But I will change all that."

Jia Yuan suddenly laughed and said, "Just with you? You also want to change all this?"

Lu lifted his tiny chest and continued, "I am not yet strong, but if I am strong, there will be changes."

Jia Yuan looked at Lu's bright eyes as if he wanted to see his determination in his eyes. Lu didn't budge at all, a pair of glowing eyes unreservedly telling all about himself.

"You're still so confident," Jia Yuan said, unable to help but be a little curious. "What makes you so confident? Just based on the fact that you are the only son of the Marshall Saint? Based on your current talent, the status of a marshall saint's only son is indeed honorable, but to the foreigners, it is nothing at all. Your talent is indeed awesome, but a genius who has not grown up is not really a genius. Grandmaster, Marshall, King, Marshal Emperor - these three hurdles are one harder than the other, not to mention the highest difficulty level of Marshall Saint. So, in my opinion, this confidence is really unwarranted."

In fact, the source of Lu's confidence was simple. "Because I have you," he said.

Jia Yuan didn't even have the confidence to open up and had the nerve to say he was open. After a light laugh, Jia Yuan stopped paying attention to Lu and closed his eyes once again.

Lu attempted to speak again but received no response. He frowned, looking at his master not far away, and couldn't help but let out a sigh. Sure enough, he was still too young, and at this age, no matter what words you say or what promises you make, people will treat you as a joke.

Those things that Lu had said - even his father, Lu Chong Xang, a martial arts saint, couldn't do them. Let alone the fact that he was nothing more than a tender child who hadn't grown up yet. Jia Yuan could say a few words to him, and it was already considered to give a response. Still wanting to give an inch and want X wuan to be completely convinced was really looking down on the heroes of this world.

His master once taught him how to use people in a military course, and one of the rules was never to look at what a person says but what he does. Now, what about the fact that he hasn't done anything? What's so convincing about that?

After thinking about this point, Lu no longer dwelled on it. He stood up and saluted, turning around and leaving the 10,000 Swords Pavilion. Since Master wants to be left alone, let's give him some time to think alone. Anyway, the side quest of bringing Master back to the human race had already been completed, which meant that Xiao Yuan shouldn't rebel against the human race again. So, he could put his heart down a little.

After Lu had left, he didn't know how much time had passed until night fell, and the 10,000 Swords Pavilion was pitch black. Before Jia Yuan slowly opened his eyes, it seemed that he had finally figured something out, and the once cold and bleak eyes had become somewhat brighter, as if a drowning man had finally seen a glimmer of hope.

Grabbing the lifesaving straw, he once again sensed a glimmer of hope - a possible future for humankind. Xiao Wuan whispered, his emotions suddenly surging as he laughed, "You spoke those words; don't dare regret them. I'll help you build this foundation for the ages." The conversation took place at Marshall Saint's residence, Yao Guang Pavilion. Luu, seated at the upper position, recounted today's battle with the crowd. He suddenly sneezed, dismissing it as strange.

The story unfolded about a false transformation clan, pretending to be a master and tricking Luu into confronting them. Luu revealed how he saw through their deception with a single glance. He explained the dangers of the foreign race, called The False Transformation race, as they could completely change their form, making it impossible to detect spies among them.

The young martial artists listened intently, their expressions focused. Luu's account of the day's events was significant, attracting numerous martial Kings and martial Emperors to support him. One of the young martial artists inquired about Luu's ability to detect the false transformation, and Guan Chang, who had been listening, was surprised that his line was taken.

Luu explained that, although the disguise of the false transformation was seamless, he felt an innate sense that something was wrong. This could be attributed to a martial artist's sixth sense or the effect of his Pichan Luckstone, which increases luck and good fortune. Luu's victory resulted from his instincts and the treasure's effect.

The young martial artists were captivated by Luu's story, admiring his intelligence, courage, and decisiveness. Guan Ching, eager to join in the praise, marveled at Luu's ability to defeat a powerful foreign adversary at such a young age. The group envisioned a future where Luu's achievements would surpass even the martial saints. This admiration marked the beginning of Luu's growing legend among the young martial artists.

Looking around at the crowd, he said seriously to me, "This is nothing at all, but I hope that in the future, you guys will be able to do the same. Today's Diaa, as well as the entire human community, can be described as stormy. It's not too much to say that it's in danger, just waiting for us to grow up. In the future, we will help the building to fall and save the world, like me, becoming great Heroes who save the world."
When one little kid heard this, he was a bit excited, and all of them were immersed in a marvelous atmosphere of doing great things together in the future. The power of example and infection is infinite.
Originally, this group of second-generation ancestors, it is impossible to have such a great ambition. Since following the S side of Luu, such words have been said more than once or twice. Gradually, they remembered, gradually infected, and gradually more and more. A great goal even though they don't know how to do it yet or what that would really mean, it doesn't stop in their minds. One more seat of becoming a hero just waiting to take root and sprout.
Later, in Chapter 61, the object of the mission took the initiative to send it to the door. Stage Four: Quest recognition of 100 companions, obtaining a top-quality Heavenly and Earthly Wonder. Current progress: 81 out of 100. Progress has increased again, and we are only 19 people away from completion, with more than half the time remaining. Should be done. Lou, you weren't sure. After all, with this kind of quest, the further back you go, the slower the progress becomes. If it was stuck at 99 out of 100, Luu's mind would collapse.
Despite having completed the first three stages of the quest, the fourth stage of the quest rewards was the main event: absolute Heaven and Earth wonders. It's unimaginable what kind of goodies will be available. The mid-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure alone, the pishy luck suppression Stone, had helped you to easily turn danger into safety in times of Crisis.
Previously, he was still thinking that his current age was too young. Even if he brushed more rewards and gathered more wool, he could only use it when he grew up. But this attack directly changed Luu's view. Such treasures are plentiful. Luu took another look at the main quest. At this stage, please try to reconnect with her after 22 years of absence. Mission reward: R dust sword technique. The task is simple and can be easily accomplished by knowing who the other person is, but only if you know who it is.
Luu turned his head to look at Yaning next to him and opened his mouth to ask, "Have you completed the task I gave you this morning?" When Yug Guing heard this, a look of shame appeared on his face. "It's not finished yet, but there's already some progress."
When Lou You heard this, he smiled and said, "There's no need to rush. Don't have too much pressure. I can see that you've tried your hardest to do it and haven't been lazy in groping for fish nor have you failed to take your orders to heart. And that's enough. After all, it is still a child. The ability to do things a little worse is also very normal. This point can be understood, and those few little girls since can be by you, Ya fans, family history certainly not bad. Want to investigate must be a little difficult."
Yaning was worried about being scolded, but when he saw that Lou You not only didn't scold himself but comforted himself instead, he was immediately moved and quickly said, "Just for these few days, I promised to complete the task."
Luu smiled and patted Yanching's shoulder. "I'm optimistic about you."
After the banquet was over, Lou You touched his stomach. Since he had started cultivating, his meal size was obviously much larger, and from time to time, he would feel hungry. It had been a good while since I'd eaten a lot at this party and had some juice, and I was actually feeling hungry again.
Generally speaking, at this stage, ordinary food is already difficult to satisfy the body's needs. Ordinary martial artists would take Chi and blood potions as a way to replenish the nutrients their bodies needed. Those with slightly better families, on the other hand, will eat foods that contain Chi and blood.
Luu had not eaten those before because he had not yet cultivated his body. It was too fragile, and oversupplementation would not only not be beneficial but would cause all sorts of problems in his body. He's clearly stepped into it now. This was something that Bayu Ya obviously hadn't considered. It wasn't that it was negligent, but normally, it takes a long time of cultivation before one steps into the stage of needing food supplements.
In other families, children start practicing from the age of 3 weeks and usually don't need special dietary supplements until they are five or 6 years old. Even for those who are gifted and talented, it is only at the age of four that they begin to take dietary supplements. However, Lou You, from the beginning of cultivation to now, full of not even a few days, actually needs dietary supplements. It is really too fast. Cannot think of normal thinking like this.
Luu took out a lollipop from his pocket, tore off the wrapping, and stuffed it into his mouth, using the sugar to fight off his hunger a little bit before he went to find By Yuyo and told her about this matter. Without walking for long, Lou You saw a little guy with crocheted hair, probably about Lou You's age, maybe slightly older than him. At the moment, looking around carefully, observing the surroundings, giving off a sense of stealing that was very heavy.

Lu walked over and gently patted the little guy's shoulder. The little guy yelped and turned around violently, his body unsteady, and he sat on the ground in a crouch. Only then did Lu see her appearance. The little one looked more delicate than a doll, with a rosy face and dark, deep eyes that flashed with curiosity as he looked up at Lu. "What's your name? Who is your family? Why are you here?" Although the little guy was cute, Lu didn't care much as she asked nonchalantly. 

It seemed that the little guy was startled by the fall, or perhaps Lu's tone was too harsh, because he just stared at Lu with interest. At this moment, he even wrinkled his nose and started to cry out. "Oh wow," he opened his mouth to cry, which seemed to be a special ability of children. Tears rolled down his face like beans, as if he had really encountered something extremely sad. Seeing the little guy crying, Lu opened his mouth in dismay. "What are you crying for? I was just casually asking."

Lu had never encountered a child who cried so much. The children he had dealt with were generally much older, and had never encountered such an unreasonable one who cried so easily. "I'm not being mean, don't cry," he said, but the little guy just continued to cry. Lu felt a little panicked and quickly took a lollipop from his mouth and stuffed it into the little guy's. Surprisingly, the little guy who was crying uncontrollably stopped crying the next second. As if it was raining, his face changed quickly. She shivered, holding the lollipop, and looked at Lu with big, watery eyes. "My name is Luu. What is your name?"

Lu was afraid of this guy. His tone was coaxing, softer than a whisper. The little girl, Riverside Snow, spoke with some crying in her voice. Lu felt that this name was familiar, and a thought came to mind. This was the name the mother had mentioned just then. The system suddenly appeared with a prompt: "Reestablish contact with him. Mission accomplished." Lu blinked in surprise. "This is too sudden. I was thinking that I might have been counted by this system, causing the main quest to get stuck, but I didn't expect it to be completed so quickly, and it's still the subject of the mission. Who's coming forward?"

Lu glanced at the system prompt and then at the little girl with interest. Was this the fiancé he had been waiting for in the future? Chapter 62: Let Me Bully a Child. Lu felt a pleased smile as he surveyed the scene, even giggling. "This guy, he's not going to be a cutie, right? Come to think of it, waiting for yourself for 22 years in the future isn't stupid enough." Lu realized that she wasn't a little cutie and smiled. He saw Bayyo looking at him with a serious face, and next to her was a stunningly beautiful woman. Jangan looked like a savior and hurriedly ran over, grasping the corner of the beautiful woman's clothes and hiding behind her, only revealing a head to look at Lu as if he had done something terrible.

Lu wiped his feet and was about to run away, but Bayyo grabbed him back. "How did you make someone cry?" Bayyo asked with a furrowed brow. "I don't know why. I just asked her her name and she started crying," Lu said hurriedly. "You think I'm a cutie pie when you ask people their names and they cry," Bayyo said with some amusement. "Really?" Lu said hurriedly. "Ask her if you don't believe me," Bayyo turned her head to look at Jiang Bangu and asked, "Did he bully you?"

Jiang Bangu first nodded and then shook her head. "He didn't do it on purpose. I was startled and accidentally fell. I told you, I even gave her my candy," Lu said, perking up. "That's because I misunderstood you," Bayyo turned her head to look at Lu, and her tone slightly eased up before introducing him. However, Lu had long known that the identity of this Jiang Bangu. Even as she was invited to the residence of the Marshall Saint, it was estimated that By Yuyo moved the idea of the two families of children getting to know each other in advance. But anyway, it was a little too early, wasn't it? "Oh my mother, why are you in more of a hurry than I am?" Lu glanced at By Yuyo with complicated eyes. This look made By Yuyo feel a little funny. She rubbed Lu's head hard. "What kind of look are you giving, right, Mom? I feel like I'm a bit underfed lately."

Lu remembered something and told By Yuyo about it. "Can't get enough to eat," By Yuyo froze for a moment.

And quickly reacted, understanding what Luu was talking about. Ever since I started practicing cultivation, my stomach gets hungry very quickly. At first, I was able to alleviate it by eating more, but lately, I've had this feeling that eating ordinary meals doesn't seem to be able to alleviate my hunger anymore. Luu nodded and spoke. Hearing this, not only was Bayu Ya surprised, even the beautiful woman next to her was also surprised. The only one who still didn't understand what this meant was Jang Bangu. "Let me take a look," Bayu Ya grabbed Luu's arm and released her spiritual power, feeling it carefully. "Why can't you get enough to eat? Is this sickness?" Jang D-shu, who was looking at her own mother, asked with some curiosity. The beautiful woman replied gently, "It's not that he's sick, but that he has begun to cultivate. That's why he feels underfed. Ordinary food can't satisfy his body's needs." "Then why don't I have this feeling?" Giang Bangu asked strangely. "I've recently started practicing as well." The beautiful woman frowned, unable to say anything. She couldn't say that he was a genius among geniuses. How could you compare such words? After thinking for half a day, the beautiful woman spoke, "He's more special." The little girl was also simple and didn't think much about it. She nodded her head and continued to look at Luu. After a long time, the look on Bayu Ya's face could be described as both shocked and happy. Happy was Luu's rapid progress; shocked was that the progress was too fast. This was only a few days of cultivation. It had only been a few days since he practiced, and he was already at this level. "Mom, how's it going?" Luu looked up and asked. "Although I don't know much about the sword and martial arts way, your current stage of physical strength is already almost considered to be in the middle of the first Realm. So it's normal to feel like eating doesn't quench your hunger," Bayu Ya slowly said. "Only in the middle of the first realm?" This was Luu's first reaction, and without much thought, he blurted it out. Bayu Ya couldn't help but say, "What do you mean, only in the middle of the first realm? You've only been practicing for a few days. This is already at the middle of the first realm. To be honest, I didn't even expect you to progress so quickly. Before, I was negligent in your nutrition." Luu nodded. To be honest, he wasn't surprised by this rate of progress. With the Dao Embryo Dan and the Dragon Tiger Golden Dan, coupled with the sword pool on Master's side, cultivating so painstakingly for a few days before reaching the middle stage of the first realm wasn't really fast. After all, it was only pre-cultivation, and the difficulty was already low. This is not a fast pass; it only means that the Hang is not big enough, the strength is not enough, it also needs to be increased. Just as Luu was thinking this, a system prompt suddenly appeared before his eyes. Seeing the panel prompt, Luu's face couldn't help but look a little odd. "This is really speak of the devil, speak of the devil. This system is too factious." On the system panel, the text slowly emerged: "You have managed to establish contact with her whom you have not seen for 22 years, but you know deep down that you owe her too much to make up for in just a few words. After so many years of not seeing her, her face is still so cold and beautiful, it's as if the years haven't left half a trace on her body." Luu looked at the words in front of him and then glanced at Ride Snow. Because she had just cried, there was some snot sucked in, which felt a little uncomfortable, so she wiped it with the skirt of the beautiful woman next to her. The beautiful woman immediately exploded and couldn't help but pinch the cheeks of this mischievous little girl. Luu looked cold and beautiful. Although he knew that the system was 40 years ahead of schedule, the contrast was too great to resist laughing. The text was still floating on the system panel: "You looked at her, the guilt in your heart overflowing, but she didn't seem to care. She explained to you a bit so that you don't make a fool out of yourself. These 22 years, she wasn't waiting for you; she just didn't want to talk about marriage, so she used you as a front and then focused on cultivating. She told you not to feel guilty and not to take this to heart, and you seem to agree with that and let go a little. It's at this point that you suddenly react to the question of why, if she really didn't care, she could say these 22 years off the top of her head. You vaguely realize that it's not that simple. You know that she specializes in martial arts. Next, please challenge her and prove that you are no longer the scrapper you once were. Please defeat her with honor. Convince her. Mission reward: Red Dust Sword Heart." "What the hell kind of mission is this? Making me bully kids?" Chapter 63. "How can a martial artist's thing be called a fight?" To be honest, this mission was a bit different from what was expected. Luu had thought that the system mission might be to get Jang Bi Anu's forgiveness, get her to accept himself, or even complete a date with her or something like that. After all, it's a dove's 22-year engagement, and the tasks associated with her should follow that direction. Who knew that the system really didn't follow the rules at all and even...

Here is the text with improvements to the English while maintaining the original meaning:

Luu asked him to have a proper duel with Jiang Bang-u, but even beating her to a pulp, he couldn't spit out the bitter taste of old blood. He knew it wasn't the system's fault. This system released tasks according to the standards of 40 years later. After 40 years, meeting with Jiang Bang-u again and meeting friends with a martial arts skill that was supposed to be the basic operation of a martial artist couldn't be more normal if Luu could defeat her in a dignified manner. It would naturally convince her, and the otherwise frosty relationship would ease. But it was 40 years ago; Jiang Bang-u was just a little kid who couldn't move without crying, and she was still scared of him. She still needed her mom's protection. Yeah, Luu had good reason to doubt that if he really laid his hands on her, mom would just whip his ass. This was what to do with this situation.

The bullet: he'd take the blame for being bitter about the snow on the river. The main thing to realize was that this was the main quest. If it was a side quest, it could be put off for a while, but this was the main quest, so there was no way around it. And if you didn't complete it, the quest progress would be stuck. Luu was originally worried that there was no way to find the girl who had waited for him for 22 years, but as a result, now that he had just found it, he had to get on and defeat it. And to be honest, he was a little embarrassed by the way he hadn't taken a close look at the rewards from the last mission.

L you thought like this and scanned the details on the system panel. Red Dust sword technique: rank seventh, quality perfect, type battle technique. Effects: A sword technique that can affect the opponent's emotions, and after practicing it to the highest level, it can drag the opponent into its own fantasy world and then kill the opponent silently. Description: It is rumored to be from the hands of the ancient Red Dust sword Immortal, only the great is not too high, so the authenticity is doubtful. But it is undeniable that this sword skill is very good, even beginners can learn and use it, and it is one of the few high-grade moves that can be used even in low Realms. So it may be used as a gift to pass on to future generations.

The Red Dust sword technique: Red Dust sword technique introductory. Looking at the detailed text on the panel, Luu could clearly feel that he had initially grasped the true meaning of this Red Dust sword technique, but unfortunately, it was only an introduction, and it still needed Luu to slowly familiarize himself with it and gradually master it before he could step by step move towards his great success. Needless to say, the reward was slightly disappointing, since it was after all a low-difficulty mission. It only needed to re-establish contact with Jiang Bang-u. Even if the mission was completed, such a simple mission, it was impossible to have too high a reward.

The second quest is also interesting: defeat Jiang Bang-u, and you'll get Red Dust sword heart. Red Dust sword heart – from the sound of the name alone, it seemed to have some connection to the Red Dust sword technique that was rewarded in the previous quest. Perhaps after retaining the Red Dust sword heart, the Red Dust sword technique would go from introductory to grand completion. It has to be said it's quite possible because this task if placed 40 years later could not be less difficult. Jiang Bang-u had devoted herself to martial arts for so many years, and her strength was definitely not to be underestimated. Even though Luu had surged forward in a short period of time, it was ultimately too short of a period of time and too much time had been wasted earlier. 40 years later, this Riverside snow would definitely be a formidable enemy. Trying to beat her squarely is difficult, but alas, this is not 40 years later.

Lu you thought like this and then looked at this shivering lollipop little girl. The sugar seemed to have finished, and he bit the stick just in time to feel Luu's scrutinizing gaze. Keenly aware of the danger, the little girl hastily hid behind the beautiful woman. Luu grinned. This little girl, her sense of smell was quite sharp, but is that all it takes to escape my clutches? Not at all. Luu's heart let out an evil laugh, but his face was full of innocence as he glanced at Bayu Yao and then at the beautiful woman. And opened his mouth to ask, "Mom, Auntie, can I take her to play?" Saying so, Lu you pointed at the snow by the river. Hearing Lu you say this, that beautiful woman's face immediately showed a smile. She hastily grabbed Jiang Bang-u behind her and tenderly said, "And take you to play, it he has a lot of toys. Oh, go over there."

Little children were still very naive. And when Jiang Bang-u heard this, she hesitated for a moment but still walked over. "Let's go," Luu said with a smile. Well, the little girl nodded, though she was a little wary. How old are you, Luu asked casually? Four. Ah, but even so, you have to call me brother. You hear me? Luu opened his mouth. Why shouldn't it be the younger brother? Jiang Bang-u stared with white eyes, and there seemed to be some defiance in her eyes, possibly because it couldn't be according to age. Luu explained, not.

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

To mention, even those children who are five or six, seven or eight, or even as old as 10 years old, all have to call me "Big Brother." Jiang Bangu asked with some surprise when he heard this, surely it must be true. Have you ever heard of the great summer hero, Liu Yong? He asked, as if he had heard of it before. Jiang Bangu obviously had some impression of him. I'm the leader of this circle, and everyone has to call me "Brother" and can't be an exception, Lu. You said seriously, otherwise, it would be a mess. The minority obeys the majority. Do you know? Jiang Bangu was persuaded. Have you started practicing martial arts, Lu? You seemed like you had. Lung Bangu answered honestly. How's the progress? My teacher at home says it's okay and praises me for being a genius. Hehe, so powerful! I've also recently started practicing martial arts. I've only been practicing for a few days, but I've been at it for a month or two. You should be good by now, right? That's natural. Why don't we cut a deal? No, why, mom said no to fighting. It's called sparring with friends, playing martial arts. How can you call it fighting like this? That's natural. Does that mean you're scared? You've been practicing for more than a month, and you're still afraid, right? Lu asked this, but it was just a simple provocation. Once again, it had an effect, and the little girl's eyes widened in disbelief. Of course, I'm not afraid! Just don't let me beat you to tears, and then go to complain to my mom.

Chapter 64: Cutting and Pointing

Of course, I'm not going to sue. But since you said so, if you lose later, you can't sue either. How about it, Luu? At that moment, Jang Bangu should have vaguely felt that something was off. Is not said, "Why not come over to play? Let's chat." However, she had been practicing martial arts for a month or two, and even her teacher praised her for being a genius and making rapid progress. She shouldn't lose to Liu, right? Not only was Liu younger than her, but he had only been practicing martial arts for a few days, whereas she had been at it for a month or two. That advantage is mine, I won't sue whether I win or lose. Jiang Bangu nodded and agreed readily. Hearing this, Luu smiled and nodded, although it was a bit suspicious of bullying a child. But there was no way around it. It was the task of the system, and it could only be accomplished to the best of my ability. Come on, Luu waved his hand, and his footsteps quickened a bit. Good grief! Jung Deua followed Luu and arrived at his room in a short while, standing on the soft mat, the duo officially began to spar in a test of might at that moment. The Riverside of the Snow, apparently, did not realize the seriousness of the matter. A small pose looked like a decent but also something really worthy of the name of Genius. Then Luu used only one move to take her down to the ground. Ha! Because Luu did not dare to use force, so lying on the ground, Jang Bangu did not feel the pain. She just felt a little bit unbelievable. Their movements so rapid was quickly knocked down again by Riverside snow, clearly unconvinced and climbed to his feet in three or five seconds but in no more than three or five seconds it was on the ground again! I lost again! Jang B Shu who was lying on the ground, was somewhat unable to accept this fact. How did I lose so quickly? What is this? She sat up rapidly and looked at Luu in disbelief. Why is it that every time I see you make a move, I lose? Why do I need to ask? Because the gap is too big, Luu saw Jang Bangu still unconvinced and did not see the task completion tip. I know the trouble. The thinking of children, adults are elusive. The system requires me to make her convinced. If not convinced, even if the number of times I win, I couldn't really beat this little girl violently until she was convinced, right? If I really did that, Luu's ass would definitely suffer and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to turn it into four flaps because I'm awesome aren't you convinced? Luu opened his mouth and asked, not convinced. Jang Bangu stared, thinking to herself, "I'm a genius too, how could this happen? Then, let me give you some pointers. Attack over here. I will only defend and not make any moves. Let's see if you can break my defense." Luu thought about it and opened his mouth. Good hearing these words, Jang Bangu once again saw the hope of victory and hurriedly arranged her stance and attacked again. Luu is very easy to parry. Catch a moment of moves, Cang Bangu even did not realize the gap. Her heart cannot help but sigh. This is too slow. No, it should be too stubborn. The characteristic of stubbornness of children, even if they hit the South Wall, they will not turn back. They have to hit their heads. Luu narrowed his eyes and commented directly. Your punching is unrefined. Your hooks are weak. Your footwork is loose. Your reactions are slow, and none of your movements are decent. You still want to beat me with this? What kind of dream is that? Again and again, when the stubborn Jang Banger heard this, her eyes reddened.

Gritted her teeth and attacked once more, punching and leg-sweeping, but Palm was too slow and the leg sweep was too crooked. "What did your teacher teach you?" Luu asked, his voice laced with contempt. "Your hands and feet must move together. Only in this way can you maximize your combat power and be more agile in changing styles and moves."

Racking fists and stomping bellies, Jiang Bangu's movements were too slow. "Move your arms and legs in unison," Luu instructed. "Lift your arms and send your hips to generate force. Reach the outside of your arms and heels, move quickly and vigorously, follow your legs with force, and focus on your mind and energy."

Once again, Jiang Bangu was being pointed out by Luu in such a top-down manner, and with contempt. Jiang Bangu's eyes became even redder, tears were swirling in her eyes, but after a long time they still didn't fall down. She held them back, raw with emotion.

Jiang Bangu gritted his teeth and attacked again, but instead of racking the fists and stomping the stomach, he kicked the head and slams the ears in the face of Giang Bi Anu. Luu was motionless, easily defending himself while continuing to point and say, "No, no, no. How many times have I said the hands and feet should move in unison? Why can't you do it too, you stupid fool? Listen carefully. Move your hands and feet at the same time. Turn your waist and hips to generate force. The Force reaches the center of your palm and the heels of your feet move quickly and vigorously, accurately and powerfully. Concentrate on your mind, energy, and strength."

Finally, a bit of a look of understanding crossed Luu's face. "Good," he said. "Another move."

Lu you smiled, it seemed that Jiang Bangu had finally grasped the tricks that Luu had been teaching him, and this move was struck with more than double the strength than before. Kicked over, Giang Bi Anu was still a little worried about it. "If Wu you injured would not be good," she thought, even if he does not tell his parents the injury can still be seen. But this guy's mouth is so poisonous, so she let him see their own power was also good.

Which no, after kicking over Jiang Bangu, she was confused by the feeling of this kick. It was as if kicking a piece of iron plate. Not only did it fail to hurt the other party, but she also felt that her own foot surface was shattered.

"Ow," Jiang Bangu fell to the ground in pain, and the tears that were still welling up came out at once. "Lu, you no still crying? I didn't even do it. Can I be blamed for the pain of the rebound?"

There's no way around it, kids obviously don't make sense, Luu thought to himself. He squatted down and thought for a moment. "Don't cry," he said. "If anyone bullies you in the future, you can report my name. Hearing this, Jiang Bangu's cries were noticeably smaller. Seeing that this move was useful, Lu you continued, "If the other party still dares to bully you, I'll personally step in and help you get a statement back."

Jiang Bian's tears gradually stopped as she looked at Luu. "Luu," she said, her voice small but filled with gratitude. Luu nodded, and Riverside Snow also nodded, but her feet seemed to be injured and she still couldn't help but cover her feet.

Seeing this scene, Luu said, "Then, let me see." He took off his shoes in three tries and, sure enough, he was injured. Luu reached out and pinched his foot, the pain was so intense that Jiang Ban couldn't help but scream out and almost cried once again. Fortunately, the bones were not broken. Luu opened his mouth and said, "It's just a small injury. I'll give you a rub of medicine. It'll be fine soon. I just happen to have medicine on my side."

Jiang Biang Shu with tears in her eyes agreed. Again, Jiang Bian's small hand that resembled a white jade carving was grasped by Luu, and he gently rubbed the ointment. The cheeks of Jiangan who was grasped by her feet were slightly red, seemingly a bit shy, she subconsciously drew away from her paws but couldn't pull them out.

"Don't move," Luu said without lifting his head. Jiang Bian's voice was small but she really didn't move anymore, allowing Luu to rub the medicine on herself. As the ointment was spread evenly, the slightest bit of coolness came through and the pain was definitely much less severe.

"It doesn't hurt anymore," Giang Bi Ana said with some surprise. "This ointment is very useful," Luu said as a matter of course. "Previously every time I was beaten and my ass blossomed so many times, I relied on this ointment to recover quickly, otherwise it's really hard to live this life."

Jiangan looked at Luu who was applying medicine to himself and couldn't help but open her mouth to ask, "Obviously you're younger than me, why are you so powerful?" Luu laughed and said, "That's of course because I'm open. Opened up what do you mean?" Jiang Bangu tilted her head in some confusion. It means I'm the genius of geniuses, born extraordinary, naturally very powerful. Luu said after some thought. "That's right," hearing this, Jiangan suddenly figured out something. "No wonder so many people call you big brother. So it's because you're so powerful that's why they call you big brother. Yes, in fact, in the beginning, they didn't know that I was so powerful, only because of my status as the son of the Marshall saint, but later they realized that I was very powerful and they sincerely called me big brother."

Big Brother Lou said casually as he finished rubbing the ointment and put his paw down, "It will recover after a while. This medicine is very effective." Jang Bian Schwen nodded, and the gaze that looked at Lou again carried some admiration in it. At the same time, the system's Quest prompt appeared: "This task of violently beating up kids is finally sort of done."

When Lou saw this, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief and hurriedly looked over. "You managed to defeat Edge Snow and convince her. Mission accomplished. The reward, Red Dust Sword Heart, has been issued." It was basically the same as what Lou had guessed. The Red Dust Sword Heart and the Red Dust Sword technique of this Quest reward couldn't be dissociated from each other. The two are closely related.

In that instant, Lou had a realization. "What's the red dust? The world, the mundane world bustling with the lives of ordinary people." A picture flashed before his eyes. As the saying goes, "Small hidden in the wild, big hidden in the city." The creator of this sword skill was hidden in this mundane world of red dust, living the most ordinary life. The ordinary people are busy as the sun rises, the sun sets, and rests, and the cycle repeats itself.

Lou didn't know how long it took, but he finally had an epiphany. Like the title letter on the Chintang River, he realized that he was himself. That day, he finally understood what red dust was, what life was, what people were. Returning to the basic is a big trick. From this, the Red Dust Sword Heart was born. With this Red Dust Sword Heart, he pioneered the Red Dust Sword technique. Since then, he gradually broke out into great fame and was called the Red Dust Sword Immortal.

So, this Red Dust Sword technique was really created by the Red Dust Sword Immortal, but it was created when he wasn't that strong. Lou couldn't help but think so as he felt all of this. "What's a fairy? The mountain man is an immortal traveling among the green clouds. Stay away from the world of red dust and mundanity. Do not get involved in right and wrong, cause and effect, and do not ask about the affairs of the world." But this is obviously not what Lou is pursuing. He is the son of the Marshall Saint. The burden and responsibility on his body do not allow him to escape like this. Therefore, the Red Dust Sword Immortal's Red Dust Sword Heart was quite suitable for him. Again, this is a path that suits him.

Lou could clearly feel that with the appearance of this Red Dust Sword Heart, the strength of his spiritual power had obviously increased by more than a little bit. Lou couldn't say what this Red Dust Sword Heart actually belonged to. Like a sense of enlightenment or is it like a tost heart? It seems to be not the same in any case. After having this Red Dust Sword Heart, Lou will then comprehend the Red Dust Sword skill, and it will be a matter of pushing the boat into the water.

The system did not directly feed the Red Dust Sword technique like a duck to Lou, forcing the proficiency of the Red Dust Sword technique to a great success. But it gave the traceability to give him this sword heart that senses the red dust. There's no doubt about it. It's because even if one cultivated the Red Dust Sword skill to a high level, one might not be able to comprehend the Red Dust Sword Heart. However, after possessing the Red Dust Sword Heart, cultivating the Red Dust Sword technique to a high level was nearly a matter of time.

"What's wrong with you, Jangan?" Jangan couldn't help but ask when she saw Lou dazed. She didn't know if it was an illusion or what, but she felt as if Lou was a bit different. But nothing seemed to have changed. When Lou heard this, he raised his head and glanced at Jang Bian Guan and said with a smile, "I was just thinking about things. By the way, I have a lot of toys over here. Do you want to play?"

When Jangan Schwen heard this, her eyes lit up, and she nodded. In the corner of Lou's room, a variety of toys like a small mountain pile up. After all, the family conditions are placed here by Yu Yu, who is even more unconditionally favorable to Lou. These toys were already too childish for him anyway.

"Really, as if she had heard something incredible," Jang Bian Guan asked with wide eyes, "Are you really willing to give it to me?" Lou nodded. "Thank you," Jang Bian Guan was very touched and said she had initially regarded Lou as a bad guy. But she didn't expect him to be so generous that he would even give away his own toys. "It's amazing that there are such nice people in this world." Jang Bian Guan immediately played happily, and so on. When leaving, Jang Bian Guan was not polite. Her hands were full of toys, and her arm was also clamped three.

The four toys' faces shone with extraordinary bright smiles. The beautiful woman asked her to return the toy, but she responded vigorously, "I was given this by Brother Luu." The beautiful woman felt a little amused and asked, "He's younger than you, why do you call him brother?" Giang Bang thought for a moment and replied seriously, "Because he's more powerful."

Hearing this, the beautiful woman couldn't help but look at Bayu Yao's face-to-face. Chapter 66: A new main quest unconsciously began. The night was already late, and the little girl and her mother went home. After washing up, Luu also lay down on the bed, contemplating the day's events.

The ability of that false transformation race was indeed formidable. If used at an unusual time, it would really make people defenseless. But when he grows up, that little trick won't be a threat. As for the little girl, Jang Bangu, although she was quite cute, Luu had no interest in her. After all, her age was just too young, and he was not a pervert.

The system's mainline quest, which had just ended, did not immediately issue a new one. The system probably didn't expect him to defeat Jang Bangu so quickly. Bayu Yao suddenly asked, "What do you think of Jiang Bangu?" Hearing this question, Luu snapped back from his thoughts and said with a speechless face, "Mom, you're in too much of a hurry. You didn't bring this up earlier."

BYU Yao smiled and said shyly, "If you weren't interested in her, you wouldn't have given her a gift. Although she's quite cute, she's just too small." Luu said, "She's still a year older than you." BYU Yao was somewhat speechless and asked, "That's too small?" Luu insisted on his opinion.

So, how big is big enough for you to like it? BYU Ya asked with some amusement. Well, I think her mom is just fine, Luu thought of that voluptuous and moving beautiful woman who seemed like a fruit that had been completely ripened, delicate and green, and hooked people's heartstrings. Between the knitted brows and the Smile, BYU Yao felt her hand itching a bit.

This brat didn't have a single decent word, not to beat him up was really sorry for his words. Luu was shocked to realize that something was wrong and hastily raised his head. "I'm just kidding," he said. H kidding, right? Luu thought, seeing that his mom seemed to be serious. He was a bit surprised and nodded.

"All right," he said. Then, Bayu Ya set Luu down and gave him some more time to get ready before she opened her mouth and asked, "Are you done?" Luu didn't say anything and nodded with a serious expression, "Good, I'm coming."

Bayu Ya took a step forward and rushed her Palm with one hand. Just a palm, swift as thunder, and powerful like a landslide. Luu could clearly feel a sense of powerlessness arise from the bottom of his heart when he faced this Palm, as if no matter how he avoided, he was doomed to be hit by a palm. It would be better to just give up the struggle and come to a relief. This is potential, Luu thought, not thinking that just a casual Palm could be so powerful.

This is the Great Master, or in the case of suppression of cultivation, not seriously. A strong person who could cultivate to The Grandmaster realm would not be easy to deal with. Previously, Luu had piloted an S-Class Airship and blasted a great Master head-on, but only by virtue of the airship's advantage. If he really wanted to fight head-on, he would have died 10,000 times over.

Many thoughts flashed by, and Luu's body did not stop the momentum, though powerful, it didn't knock him out completely. In that 100th of a second instant, he predicted the direction of the attack, extreme dodging, and dodging, narrowly avoiding getting hit. This dodge just now was really not a coincidence, Bayu Ya smiled and said, "Not bad."

Improved English Text:

A close call, you really dodged it. However, don't be complacent. He knew the old master had released a significant amount of water, more than just a little bit. Almost a sea's worth of water. Lu You rightfully maintained his stance and didn't pursue. He even withdrew his force and strengthened his realm. Isn't it normal to dodge? Bayu Yya was momentarily speechless as she listened to his words. This little guy sometimes goes wildly out of bounds and other times underestimates himself. Does he think his palm can just be dodged even if he releases a sea? That palm isn't fake. Not to mention, even Second or Third Realm martial artists might not avoid it. It's good to have high expectations of oneself. Yuya didn't argue this point and smiled, saying, "Now that you know the gap, it's even more important for you to cultivate well." Lu You nodded vigorously.

Bayu Yuyo touched Lu You's head, but in her heart, she couldn't help but feel emotional. How long has it been? He seems to have grown up more since then. As age passes, time always feels like it flies faster and faster. It wasn't long ago when he was still so little. Now, he holds the ambition of the clouds. For a moment, Bayu Yya didn't know whether to wish for him to grow up slower or faster. Lu You, on the other hand, frowned, thinking about his cultivation plan for tomorrow. Today's progress was slower due to the delayed cultivation process. He hadn't soaked in the sword pool and only cultivated at home. He decided to soak longer tomorrow to make up for the missing nutrients. Although Lu You's home had a similar nutrient pool, it didn't match the one on Master's side, which was specifically built for martial arts.

As Lu You pondered, a prompt suddenly appeared in his mind: "Mission coming up." Lu You was delighted and carefully checked the light screen. A line of text then slowly emerged: "After fighting with her whom you haven't seen for 22 years, you managed to defeat her and change her mind about you. However, this is not enough. As the son of the Marshall Saint, your reputation can't be confined within the human race alone. More importantly, you must let the thousands of foreign races hear your name and make them tremble. Please go to the battlefield to fight, go deep into the secret realm to intrude and suppress thousands of alien Geniuses with your natural talent, and gain 1 billion points of reputation among their communities. Mission reward: Taiu Defective Method Pill."

Lu You couldn't help but point at himself, his tiny face filled with dismay. He called out for his mother, confused by this system mission. The long single-camera coding was finally over, and they had their debut. It wasn't easy, and the readers were greatly appreciated. The book would be released three times a day for convenience. If the author received more gifts, they would increase the release frequency. Let's work together.

In Chapter 67, building an unparalleled achievement and establishing the reputation of their human race was a great task. Lu You couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the text on the panel. The difficulty of this mission was too high for him to accomplish at his current stage. They were asking him, a three-year-old, to conquer the Sands, go deep into the secret realm, and shock thousands of alien races with his great talent. It was like sending a baby to face the Tang priests and disciples. Lu You wondered if this little cutie was the system. Hindsight made him realize something was wrong. However, thinking about it further, if it was for himself 40 years later, this task wasn't an exaggeration. Lu You had received numerous system rewards, truly transforming him. Although conquering the Sands and intruding the secret realm were extremely dangerous, and even the slightest carelessness could lead to death or disappearance, true martial arts Powerhouses rose from mountains of corpses and seas of blood. Even those with the strongest natural talent had to face countless hardships and dangers to grind their way to success.

When you know there's a tiger on the mountain, you're going to the Tiger's Mountain. If you don't even have that kind of guts, how can you become a top-notch Powerhouse? So, as difficult as this task is, there's really nothing wrong with it. When you think about it, only the task for his current self was clearly a bit over the top. He couldn't help but let out a sigh before glancing at the quest reward.
Mission reward: TYU Defra of Method Pill. Seeing this reward, Luu raised his eyebrows. The name of this thing alone tells you it's extraordinary - an absolute Treasure of treasures. Nah, the difficulty of this mission is just too high. What's to be done about this? If you can't finish this main quest, then there's no way to do a new main quest afterward. Does that mean it's going to get stuck here, and that's annoying? What should be broken thinking about what when by Yu Ya saw Luu with his head lowered and somewhat depressed, she couldn't help but be a little curious as to what was going through his tiny head.
Luu froze and raised his head to look at his mom, Bayu Ya, who was standing in front of him, looking at him with a gentle face. Luu didn't know how to explain it. It took him a while to figure out what to say. If he said it outright - to go to the battlefield, to go to the secret realm, and to shock thousands of foreigners - mom would either think he was joking or that he was crazy. He was really too young now, far from growing up and venturing to those places surrounded by strong enemies. It was either joking with his own life or joking with the lives of others.
At that time, among those foreign races, the press would not circulate his mighty name but would find him ridiculous. It was after thinking about this point that Luu clearly knew that this could not be said to his old mom. And by Yu Ya, saluu didn't say anything. She didn't urge him but smiled faintly, rubbed his hair, and said softly, "You're good enough now. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. You have to remember I'll always stand behind you, and there's also your dad. So don't feel like you're not trying hard enough, hard not strong enough, or anything. You've already worked hard enough, and compared to Geniuses of the same age, you're pretty strong too, aren't you?"
Hearing this, Luu froze and subconsciously nodded. By Yu Ya's continued words, a smile finally appeared on his face. I understand. Thank you for clearing up my confusion. Even though Bayu Ya didn't know what was troubling Luu, these words still enlightened him. He was just a three-year-old child, and it was already very counterintuitive for him to be able to achieve what he was doing now. So there was no need to stress too much.
Even if you can't do the main quests, you can still do the side quests. Of course, this didn't mean that Luu gave up on this and simply lay flat in place. It's just not as stressful as it was in the beginning. As mom said, it's useless to think too much. Eating well, sleeping well, practicing well, and having fun is better than anything else.
Turning to the next day, Luu first went to a cabinet to watch politics. He saw a group of national pillar Pillars quarrel. They didn't seem happy. In the afternoon, he practiced seriously, and in the evening, he studied The Art of War in military Affairs. During this time, Luu suddenly thought of something and looked up to ask Master, "When do you think I will be able to get out of the mountain?"
When he learned this Art of War military Jaia Wuan, he glanced at Luu and directly saw through his mind. Faintly asking, "What do you want, Luu?" Luu directly stood up and replied with a serious face, "I want to lead my troops into battle, win successive battles, plow through the land, and defeat thousands of foreign races. Drinking horses from the vast sea, sealing the wolf, building an unparalleled feat, and establishing a great reputation for my human race in this world." There were also these idioms, and although the source was somewhat ancient, it didn't prevent Xiao Wuan from understanding the meaning.
He looked at Luu in shock and couldn't help but open his mouth and for a moment, he was speechless. To be honest, Jawanan had originally thought that Luu had said that even if he broke the sky, he only wanted to go to the battlefield to experience fighting. Who would have thought that his ambition would be so great? It's only been a few days since you learned the military Art of War, and you're thinking of doing something big like this. In fact, Luu was not to be blamed for being a fool and thinking too much. Rather, he was looking for a crack at that outrageous task. Since personal strength could not be rapidly improved, he had to find another way.

In a short period of time, through the mastery of The Art of War and commanding the army to win great victories on the battlefield, one could also gain a hefty reputation. However, it was clear that he was still overthinking things. Xiao Yuan commented unflinchingly, "Trying to make such a big deal with your current three-legged command is tantamount to bringing yourself and your soldiers to their deaths." Luu didn't care and nodded, saying, "Master, of course I know this. That's why I'm asking you, when will I be able to leave the mountain to learn this military Art of War?" Xiao Wuan glanced at him and pointed to the side, "Defeat me on this sandbox." Luu, instead of being discouraged, his eyes lit up, and he said, "Let's play another game. Don't be afraid that the boss is hard to beat; be afraid that the boss doesn't light up the blood bar. As long as the blood bar is lit up, that means you can fight through it." Chapter 68: How to Lure the Master into the Ship of Thieves

Xiao Wuan looked at Luu with some surprise. "Just a short one-day time, and not seeing you will feel like you've lost a limb, or is it because of yesterday's attack or the 10,000 Swords Pavilion's words?" Xiao Wuan didn't think much of it and nodded. "The words of the party, I'm not joking. If you can defeat me on the sand table, even without experiencing actual combat and still at the stage of talking on paper, you would still be considered to have the ability to command a team. It's absolute confidence in my own strength." Luu was far from trying to win against him; the facts proved that it was indeed the case. Even though Luu was courageous and became more and more courageous the more he lost, the huge gap could not be erased. Not long after, Luu was once again defeated. "Master, you are too powerful," Luu lamented. "It was just a sand table simulation game, and I lost so dryly. If it were a real battlefield, the space to play would only be greater, and the advantage would be more obvious, and the gap would be further widened. Want to play another round?" Jawan narrowed his eyes at Luu and asked, "Do you need me to point out your mistakes?" Xiao Wuan suddenly asked. Hearing this, Luu said without thinking, "Of course, I need it." Xiao Wuan nodded slightly, then waved his hand to reset the virtual battlefield and refresh the terrain randomly. "Let's begin." A moment later, when you want, opened his mouth to reprimand, "Don't think about soldiering up right off the bat; it's the most foolish decision. Even if you have a huge gap between you and me, don't give up on a frontal battlefield engagement." Jawan swept a glance at the sand table, even with the fog of war, he still saw through Luu's thoughts. He smiled contemptuously and continued nonchalantly, "Fighting head-on in a dignified manner has a very good effect on improving your commanding ability. Don't run away from a head-on duel." When Luu heard this, he was inevitably a bit dumbfounded and couldn't help but wonder if Master had turned on God's perspective. How did he know so clearly? Was it so obvious that one's movements were so obvious? Xiao Wuan glanced at Luu and said indifferently, "Your movements are so obvious. You've attempted several risky strikes, and each time you've had a good effect. Do you really think that I won't be on guard? What a dumbass. Can't you even tell when you've been fooled?" When Luu heard this, he was a bit embarrassed. He really thought that every time he divided his troops and ventured out, he had good results. It was only his failure to follow up and command that caused him to be passive all the time. So it turned out that he had fallen into a trap right from the start. Next, he was criticized even more unmercifully. "What the hell are you doing with this parade command? The time, place, and timing are all wrong. You are really great. I've never seen such a great person today. Really an eye-opener. Again, do you want to divide and surround me? Do you want to look at your base camp? It's already leaking a huge hole. I just need to attack straight in. How are you going to defend? Are you stupid? You can even make such a low-level mistake. This is why you're still making small moves when you're stretched to the limit on the battlefield. You're thinking of making a surprise move. Do you really think it's that easy? Childish fellow. I've said it all. Don't run away from frontal battles. How do you see it again? Your ideas are really too simple. Don't write your tactics directly on the surface. You need to do the real in the imaginary, the real in the imaginary, hide your ideas completely. Don't put them completely on the surface. With a commander like you going into battle, you'll be seen through to the bottom. Also, I'll tell you one more thing. Since ancient times, the vast majority of strange soldiers and strange moves or choices are made with the big picture in mind, not something you can just use right off the bat. Take back those casual thoughts of yours under the guidance of one sentence after another." To be honest, Luu was a little red. He was staring at the sand table, anxious and angry.

There was nothing he could do about his master at this moment. He finally understood how Jang Bangu had felt when confronted with his instructions earlier. "Is this the price of growth?" Luu let out a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. Then, he turned his master's instructions, one by one, into motivation and sustenance. Unconsciously, the night was late, so Luu simply stayed by his master's side, thinking about the things on the sand table even as he slept. Today was a bad day for being yelled at, but it was also one of the most improved. "I also wonder," he mused, "according to this progress, when will I defeat my master and have the ability to command an army?" The question arose: even if he had the ability, his mom and dad would never let him go to war. Letting a fledgling kid go to war and become a general or something was not child's play; it was crazier than going to the cabinet. "Unless I could take my master with me," he thought. "In this way, no matter whether it is Dad or Mom or the army under his command, there is nothing to say. After all, the Hall of the former Marshall General of Dashia as a backer—who dares to disobey? Who has a problem with that?" It was a bit foxy, but he had to say it worked. However, his master would certainly not agree easily, and it was a challenge to lure him onto the "ship of thieves."

Just as Luu was pondering these questions, Xiao Jing, who was asleep on the side, suddenly spoke, "Big Brother, you know, Dad is so fierce and keeps lecturing you. Don't you feel scared?" Xiao Jing couldn't help but ask. Just now, Luu and Xiao Wuan had fought against each other. Xiao Jing was on the side, listening to his own father's various reprimands for a while. They were all a little shivering, fearing that they would be caught in the crossfire. Who knew that Luu was like a nobody, still playful after the end, and even had a post-game replay with his old man? This made Xiao Jing very surprised. This question he had held back for a long time and at this moment he finally couldn't help but open his mouth.

When Luu heard this, he smiled and said, "Your old man is just a knife mouth and tofu heart. Let him curse a few words. If not for seeing him so old and a little bit poor, I would have retorted back. I don't want to get on his bad side, you know? If I wanted to argue with him, he wouldn't be able to beat me. He didn't even beat me in the previous fights." Xiao Jing's answer left him somewhat speechless, but on second thought, it seemed true. Luu suddenly remembered something and opened his mouth to ask, "By the way, why didn't you come over to the party yesterday?" "Because I thought Dad was in a bit of a strange mood, so I thought I'd stay home with him," Xiao Jing said truthfully. "In that case, then tomorrow I plan to organize another one. Do you want to come to my house?" Luu asked casually. "Come!" Xiao Jing immediately nodded without the slightest hesitation.



Chapter 692: Cracks

The following evening, Marshall Saints' Residence, Yao Guang Pavilion. After three decades of drinking, Luu suddenly sighed. Yu Guan Ching, who was on the side, immediately looked over and hurriedly opened his mouth to ask, "Big Brother, today all the brothers have gathered together to speak freely and happily. Why is Big Brother sighing? Is there something on your mind?" "Yeah," Luu nodded and shook his head again. "It's hard... difficult." Yaning immediately widened his eyes and then directly stood up and said loudly, "We are all great Sing J! As the saying goes, many hands make light work. If we work together, what can't be accomplished?"

The sound of this yelling was so loud that inside Yao Guang Pavilion, the gazes of all the people all looked over, and even the voices of the conversation stopped. Hearing this and feeling the gazes of the crowd, Luu thought for a moment and said, "Since everyone wants to know, then I'll talk about it."

Luu's idea was simple. Since the main quest could not be completed for the time being, the side quests could be done. The fourth stage of the quest was now at 81 out of 100, and as soon as it was completed, the absolute best Heaven and Earth wonders would be obtained. Although the more you get to the back, the more difficult it is to complete the quest progress, but compared to that counterintuitive main quest, this side quest was a lot more approachable.

Listening to Luu's words, the Yao Guang Pavilion quieted down some more as everyone quietly listened to him. These days, down the line, Luu had gradually built up his prestige among this group of people. He looked at the crowd and slowly opened his mouth, "Everyone should know that the me of today has gained a little bit of fame in Diaa and even in the entire human race, but I'm still viewed by others... so I try to prove myself from time to time. I first went to the cabinet to participate in politics and discuss state affairs, and the cabinet members praised me for acting decisively and thinking carefully. One of them was astonished and under my leadership, I solved the critical situation of the Hellstar battlefield. Then I worshipped the former Marshall of Great SI, a peak Marshall Emperor, as my master, and I practice diligently every day while also learning The Art of War. My master praised me for my great talent, saying that I often used the military with a lot of strange moves and that I was a rare general..."

Here is the revised text with improved English:

Bragging about himself, Luu was met with a mixture of admiration and awe from the people present. It was as if he was able to fool them easily with his words, which were laced with a balance of truth and falsehood. Whether he was talking about politics or the mysterious matter of the Hing, his words were largely true, albeit mixed with a dash of fantasy. Even the adults who overheard him were beguiled, especially those who had a basic understanding of what he was saying. However, Xiao Jing, his face a picture of subtlety, popped out with a remark that seemed like a slight rebuke, but was not. Xiao Jing did not push the matter further, and Luu continued to speak in a boastful tone, claiming that he had even piloted a spaceship and blasted a group of foreign aliens to near death two days ago. "Tell that to those foreigners," he said, "that I'm not just some random seventh realm Grandmaster who thinks he's above the law."

Xiao Jing couldn't help but be curious about Luu's claims, wondering if there was any truth to what he was saying. He glanced at his big brother, who seemed unfazed by Luu's declarations. Luu continued to speak, saying that although he had accomplished a great deal, he felt that it was far from enough. He wanted to make a big impact and have his reputation acknowledged by the foreigners, so that they would tremble with anxiety at the mere mention of his name. However, Luu admitted that he was stumped for ideas, and his companions, a group of children, offered a range of poorly conceived plans to help him achieve his goal. They suggested that they all use their family powers to create a massive spaceship fleet and participate in a battle against the foreigners in Luu's name.

The children's suggestions were met with a mixture of excitement and skepticism, but some of their ideas were more feasible than others. For example, the idea of pooling their family resources to create a massive fleet and fighting in Luu's name was a plan that could potentially work, if done correctly. This was especially true since their family forces were not to be underestimated, and if they were able to work together, they would be a force to be reckoned with. It was likely that their parents would see investing in this endeavor as a solid business move, rather than just a wild goose chase.

Luu seemed pleased with the suggestions, but then someone asked him if he had ever heard of the Reincarnation Tower, a mysterious place that was said to be located in a secret realm that only opened once a century. Luu was intrigued by the question, and the person asking him, Chuang, began to explain the legend of the Reincarnation Tower in detail. According to Chuang, the Reincarnation Tower was a massive structure that was part of a complex system of wormholes that crisscrossed the galaxy. The Tower was said to have nine floors, and each floor was a stage in a "breakout" game, where the goal was to clear the floors faster than others. The rewards for achieving this goal would be substantial, and would be worth the effort.

Luu's eyes lit up as he listened to Chuang's explanation, and he asked more questions about the Reincarnation Tower and its secrets. The story of the Reincarnation Tower had a draw to it that Luu couldn't resist, and he became increasingly fascinated by the possibilities it presented.

The ninth realm martial emperor can continue to be used and be very powerful, of course, if it's the same ranking, the stronger Realms are definitely better than the weaker ones. According to legend, the reincarnation Tower left behind by an ancient Powerhouse was specifically designed to screen airs, but so far, an unknown number of years have passed, and no one has been able to become the reincarnation Tower Lord. There's still more than a month to go before the opening of The Reincarnation Tower this time. If big brother can enter it and break into the rankings, he'll definitely be able to shake the universe and tell all those foreign races to calm down. Lu, you listen to these words, nodded slightly. I have to say, these two plans are very good. It's all about strength in numbers. Three stinking AIDS are better than any opponent. Lu had no expectations of this. Who thought he had really found two cracks for him?

Chapter 70, Volume to the extreme, luu didn't make a decision in a hurry but first asked some things about The Reincarnation Tower, and there were quite a few people who knew about the legend of this reincarnation Tower. For example, the reason why luu's old man, Lu Chong, was able to break through to the 10th realm to become a marshall Saint had something to do with this reincarnation Tower. Again, in the past, Lu Chong walked to the peak of the ninth realm but was left on the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, which was precisely because of this that he was able to find the direction of the road ahead, and at the same time, he also obtained a supreme treasure to rely on. In that time, Lu Chong managed to kill his way to first place, which was the first time in the history of the human race. Obviously, it was extremely difficult to make a name for oneself in The Reincarnation Tower, and the difficulty was even more outrageous, especially in the lower Realms of The Reincarnation Tower. This was an undifferentiated competition facing countless starfields and countless races. The low realm Geniuses of the human race were too many to count, not to mention the countless civilized groups in the universe. Luu was still very confident in himself, after all, he was the strongest. How could the other one realm be compared to him, even if they were Perfection of the 1st cm realm, even if they were stronger and had more special abilities? Even if they were allowed to have one hand, they would be able to push right through it horizontally. But soon, when luu consulted Yuya about this matter, he realized that he had thought too simply. Bayu yuya glanced at him and said, "Although breaking into the reincarnation Tower doesn't have any life and death dangers, you can indeed give it a try, but trying to break into the top rankings is difficult, very difficult, and almost impossible."

Didn't say I'd take first place, either. Can I take the top 10? Lou, as Yuya continued, you seem to be thinking about this matter too easily. You'd be considered awesome if you could get the top 10,000. Yuya smiled and shook her head. "The first 10,000 when luu heard this, he couldn't help but be a bit dumbfounded thinking that his mom was also looking down on him too much, but rightly so. She didn't quite understand his current strength. Yuya naturally saw that luu was unconvinced and immediately explained, 'It's not that I'm looking down on you; if you were to compete with a normal first realm, you would naturally be able to win easily. But what if the other party is not a normal first realm?'"

Luu was slightly stunned and asked in a somewhat strange manner, "What do you mean on the path of martial arts? The first realm trains the skin and flesh. The second realm forges the sinus and bones. The third realm refines the visceral organs. The fourth realm replaces the blood. The fifth realm casts the golden body. At the step of casting the golden body at the fifth realm, one can choose to destroy the foundation and re-cultivate. Walk the path of cultivation again." Bayu yuya looked at luu and patiently explained the cultivation methods of the other foreign races. May differ somewhat from our human race's martial arts, but overall, there is not much of a difference. They can also retrace their cultivation path, destroying the foundation and recultivate. It can still be played like this when Lu.

Luu heard this and couldn't help but be a bit dumbfounded and immediately realized something. Means right. Originally, destroying the foundation and re-cultivated was a second chance for those whose foundations were too poor, as well as those who chose the wrong path. Ever since someone accidentally discovered that recultivated the first realm could also allow them to enter the first realm reincarnation Tower, the situation was immediately different. Bay yuyo nodded and continued, "When faced with the opportunity of The Reincarnation Tower, many fifth realm martial artists would choose to destroy their foundations and recultivate, just to enter the first realm reincarnation Tower."

The fourth realm of martial arts masters has lived a prosperous life, but the fifth realm, the realm of the golden body, is both powerful and rare. An ordinary university martial arts teacher, however, surpasses this realm in terms of benefits and other advantages. Becoming a five realm golden body martial artist is extremely challenging for an ordinary person. At this realm, one is already considered the backbone of the human race. To destroy the foundation and recultivate is not a small price to pay, and the audacity is not common among ordinary people.

The resources required to cultivate all the way to the fifth realm are substantial, and breaking through to this realm again after recultivation is even more difficult. The road to retraining is generally more difficult than the first time, which is why it's so difficult for an ordinary person to achieve the top ranking in The Reincarnation Tower, as Yuio explained slowly. Luu frowned, but admitted that Yuio was right. Even though it's difficult, one must try if one doesn't go to war, how can one know that one is not as good as those who are recultivated?

These people are desperate, Lu said with emotion, because The Reincarnation Tower only comes out once in a hundred years. Even the first place winner of The Reincarnation Tower of the first realm can obtain treasures that will be treasured by Marshall Emperor realm powerhouses. Compared to such rewards, destroying one's foundation and recultivating seems like a small price to pay.

Yuio continued, almost all of the people who chose to destroy their foundations and recultivate were unable to obtain the rewards because there are simply too many people who think the same way as them. When everyone rolls together, the environment becomes worse. Lu nodded, these people were still harming others and themselves in the end. I believe that they could all understand this.

However, the temptation of the most precious treasure is strong, Yu nodded. The order in which the reincarnation Tower opens is from the lower realm to the higher realm, and so even if these people don't get the opportunity at the first realm reincarnation Tower, they can still break through to the second realm, the third realm, or even the fourth realm, and then continue to enter it to try to obtain treasures.

Luu listened to his old mother's account and summarized only one word: volume. It's too difficult to roll. He was originally thinking that with his enlightened strength in The Reincarnation Tower, he wouldn't only be able to get the top rankings and get the treasures, but he could also spread his reputation and complete the system's main quest. Now it seems that things are not simple, the difficulty is really exaggerated, but under such a high level of difficulty and such a voluminous environment, if Luu could still kill his way out, the gold content would need no further explanation. Definitely easy to complete the main quest, thinking of this, Luu's eyes became bright as he raised his head and said, "I'm going to participate in this reincarnation Tower trial and I'm also going to rank at the top. I want to let the 10,000 races of the universe know that the son of the Marshall saint has an unlimited future."

When Bayu Yao heard this, she was speechless for a moment. She had already detailed the difficulties involved, just because she didn't want to hurt Luu's Pride. Who knows he's still so confident. Yu was silent for a long time, then nodded, "All right, you cheer." Luu listened to this somewhat perfunctory words knowing that the old mother actually does not think highly of himself. After all, the low realm trial of The Reincarnation Tower is really too difficult, even if he is amazingly talented, but only just started to cultivate, wanting to be at the top of the list is difficult, difficult, difficult. But the more underappreciated you are, the more opportunity you have to prove yourself. Chapter 71 special training program turning to the next day, Luu told his master about his intention to break into The Reincarnation Tower after Xiao. When Yuan heard this, he just nodded and didn't change his expression as if this was some rare and trivial matter. Do you think I can get a top ranking, Lou couldn't help but ask. Of course, under normal circumstances, the top 200, no, the top 100, can be fought for, but trying to get the top 30 or even the top 10 is basically impossible, Xiao Wan Yuan said indifferently. This rating from the master was obviously quite a bit higher than mom's, but not too high, obviously with regards to Luu's strength, Master knew more and naturally evaluated more accurately. Lu then said the news that he heard yesterday on his mom's side that many of the five realm golden body martial artists would destroy their foundations and rebuild them without speaking of virtues to compete with them, the one realm children. I certainly knew to that point, xia wanan nodded, then said disdainfully, but so what do you just think that those fifth realm golden body Marshall Masters will be very powerful if they were truly confident, they wouldn't have chosen to destroy their foundations nor would they have come to compete with you. Wouldn't they have simply waited for the opening of the five rounds reincarnation Tower to put it bluntly, they don't have that confidence. It's only then that they thought of destroying their foundations and recultivated to compete with you.

Upon hearing this, Luu couldn't help but be taken aback. He hadn't realized that his master's perspective on the matter was diametrically opposed to his mother's. "Of course, I'm not afraid," Luu hastily replied, "but I'm not content with just making it into the top 100. I want to take first place." Xia Wanyuan wasn't surprised by Luu's ambition. He nodded and continued, "The first place is indeed difficult to attain. Although you possess innate sword intent and are born with an innate sword mind, you must understand that the vast universe has countless communities, and the number of competitors in the first realm is undoubtedly the largest. Any minuscule difference can create a gap of nearly ten million places. Strength, substance, talent, awareness, skill, and luck - all of them are missing in order to break into the forefront. To be honest, you making it into the top 100 is already a result of my overestimation. As for you wanting to get the number one spot, it will be very, very difficult, but it's not impossible."

As he spoke, Xia Wanyuan slowly lowered his head and gazed into Luu's eyes, then softly asked, "Do you need me to help you?" For some reason, Luu inexplicably shivered upon hearing these words. What instantly came to his mind was the devil's murmur. If he agreed, in the next period of time, Luu would absolutely not want to feel good. All kinds of hellish training, the intensity pulled to full, but there was no way back for him. If he missed the opportunity of the Reincarnation Tower, Luu would have to cultivate to at least the sixth realm before his old parents would release him to go out and make a name for himself. By that time, he would be able to make some name for himself, thus completing the system's mainline mission. How much time would this take? How much of the system's wool would be lost?

With this thought, Luu looked at his master with a firm gaze. "What should I do if I really want to break into first place?" he asked. Xia Wanyuan replied indifferently, "First, I'll make a special training plan for you. I'll polish you to the first realm's great circle, then improve your all-round skills. After that, there's still combat awareness and even marshal will to be honed. In short, time is tight, and the task is heavy. You won't want to go home, let alone think about having fun. Not a moment to stop now. Do you still have that realization?" Luu didn't hesitate and nodded once again. "Please help me, master."

An inexplicable smile appeared on Xia Wanyuan's face as he slowly said, "Then don't regret it. Even if you do, I won't let you go back." Luu gulped and nodded. "Very well." Xia Wanyuan nodded and touched Luu's head. "You can contact your family now." Luu opened his mouth, knowing that time was naturally tight with only a little over a month to prepare. He called his mom on a communication video and told her about it. Yu Ya was very torn after hearing this news. To be honest, she really didn't want to agree. A month was just too long, and Luu was still so young. There was really no need to fight so hard. There was a long future ahead, so why rush it? With Luu's status, he didn't need the little resources in the Reincarnation Tower at all. His old man was a martial arts saint. What good things couldn't he get? But since this was Luu's choice, and he wanted to make an effort to break through and prove himself, she could only choose to support it.

After getting his mom's permission, Luu breathed a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that his mom would not agree. It would be awkward if she was dead set against it. Afterward, he talked about it with his buddies in the Dasha Heroes group. In the next month's time, he planned to cultivate in seclusion and attack the first place in the Reincarnation Tower to establish the prestige of his human race. The crowd in the group was all a buzz when they found out about it, and one after another expressed their support. Yesterday, after Chuyang said this matter, although they remembered it in their hearts, no one thought that Luu was so resolute and really determined to rush the barrier for the human race to fight for fame straight away. It was closed for over a month when Luu notified this. He unexpectedly found that the progress bar of the fourth stage of the quest had increased by another three points, becoming 84 out of 100. There was a backstabber in this group. Luu had thought that all the groupies of Heroes of Dasha had already recognized him. Who knew that there were actually omissions?

When Luu said this, Yaning immediately sent a private message over. "Big Brother, since you're in seclusion, I'm also going to be in seclusion. I'm also going to break into the Reincarnation Tower with big brother." Luu couldn't help but be stunned, then he replied, "Share together." Yaning quickly replied back, "That's right. The task that big brother gave me earlier, I've completed it successfully. I found the information of those four girls. I'll pass it over right now." For girls, Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows, then quickly reacted. So it turned out that this matter was still being handled by Yaning.

Leu looked at the four messages from the little girls and couldn't help but cry and laugh. Although it was no longer necessary, he still replied with a "good job." In the meantime, the Cheu family's Xuang, who had just finished training and was resting, looked at the message in the group and raised an eyebrow, a smile playing on his lips. "Good for you. I will also be in seclusion next. Let's have a match when I come out. I've been preparing for 3 years for this reincarnation Tower, forcing myself to break through realms, just waiting for this one chance. Chapter 72: The Wind Rises, and the clouds surge, deepening the depths of the deep and infinite universe. A terrifying black hole, with a diameter of 1.2 trillion kilometers, was constantly twisting and tearing. 1.2 trillion kilometers may not be intuitively comprehensible, but it can be clearly felt by changing the unit of distance to 1/8 of a light-year. The mass of this massive black hole is equivalent to 4 trillion suns, which is larger than all the planets of the Milky Way Galaxy combined. However, it was such a terrifying celestial body that was actually twisting, collapsing, and tearing at this moment. As if there was something continuously drilling out the energy fluctuations generated by the tearing of the terrifying black hole, ripples spread across tens of thousands of starfields. At the same time, an invisible passageway, spanning a despairing distance from the astronomical distance, was slowly congealing. That's a wormhole, the only passageway across the long cosmic distances for almost all civilized communities. At this stage, almost all wormholes in the universe are naturally formed. No group of civilizations could build a wormhole, not even the Twisted Evil God who spread Terror everywhere. But at this moment, that one wormhole, passing by like a spider's web, was filled with tens of thousands of civilized communities. In front of such terrifying greatness, even Marshall St. L changing could only sigh in awe.

At this moment, in the starry sky, Lu Ching's face was complex as he watched the black hole change in the distance. After a hundred years, he once again felt his insignificance. He couldn't see through it, even if he broke through to the Marshall Saint realm. Lu Chang Shang said softly, "Mighty and powerful people from the ancient era, their era was mostly before the birth of this observable universe. Today, the Big Bang gives birth to everything, and the Big Break of the universe silences everything. It's a cycle. The Tower of reincarnation, by that name, I wonder how many incarnations it has gone through, and what exactly is its purpose? Is the purpose of putting up the nine reincarnation Towers really just to look for an heir? Now that I've broken through to the 10th realm, I want to explore it again, but I can't even do it anymore. It's rejecting me. Interesting. There are quite a few unsolved mysteries in the entire universe, and this reincarnation Tower is one of them."

Just then, Lu changing suddenly sensed something and looked up in the cold starry sky. One after another, an alien Powerhouse appeared, coming here to observe the appearance of The Reincarnation Tower. The octopus-shaped alien Powerhouse, with six eyes, looked at Lu chang ching in unison and greeted him in human language. Lu Chong xong, however, didn't bother to talk to these guys and, with a turn, directly disappeared into the boundless starry sky. The octopus-shaped alien Powerhouse muttered, "Rude guy. He's only just broken through the limit realm and still has a long lifespan, so he's arrogant as hell." The spirit form of a ball of light and mist spoke, its own mist flickering brightly and darkly. "He will understand later on that he is not omnipotent. In that last battle, the human race was almost wiped out, and it was only by luck that they managed to produce a tenth realm. A huge planet suddenly appeared and issued its own voice. When the next time comes, they won't be so lucky. If he is willing to distort himself, he can still break the limits of his life and live as we do." The octopus-shaped alien Powerhouse smiled and said, "But in that case, would he still be the human race's hero?" Countless stars away, Lu changing took a step here as he turned back to take a distant look at the evil gods Caz Ora, God Crum laav, and star God Corsair. Their strength is equal to the 10th realm. Unlike those ordinary ninth realm transformed evil gods who used to be alive in the 10th realm, these totally depraved old monsters are disgusting and tricky. Even if you break through to the 10th realm, your lifespan is limited, and if you want to continue to live, you have to become a god. The price is a complete distortion of itself and the need for massive life sacrifices. It started out as a massacre sacrifice, except that this was highly susceptible to resistance. Then they began to utilize wars vigorously, promoting intercommunal warfare as a way to achieve alternative sacrifices. Gradually, these evil gods, who were simply trying to survive, used this practice to draw the entire universe into the war with the endless hatred intertwined. Everyone killed and dyed, and even if all of these damned guys fell, the war couldn't be stopped anymore, no matter what. This time, for the Reincarnation Tower, our human race must contend, whether it's a supreme treasure of the lower realms or the hope of breaking through to the 10th realm in the higher realm. One has to grasp both. Any reincarnation tower that can squeeze into the top 100,000 is...

Amidst a vast universe inhabited by tens of thousands of civilized communities, the human race gained prominence due to Li Chang's appearance. As the human race expanded rapidly, it attracted hostility. Even without expansion, the presence of a 10rm Powerhouse would still garner attention, considering the rarity of such beings.

In the human race, even across the entire universe, their strength was significant. With only a thousand inhabited planets, their collective power couldn't be underestimated. The human race's population exceeded 3 trillion, and it continued to grow. Numerous prodigies and demons were abundant, comparable to the number of CP crossing a river.

Despite being relatively inconspicuous in the grand scheme of the universe, the human race's potential was immense. Breaking into the top 100,000 of The Reincarnation Tower was considered a remarkable achievement, worthy of cultivation. Those ranking in the top 1,000 or 500 were community leaders and the epitome of geniuses, sought after by major powers.

Even if this ranking didn't provide benefits in The Reincarnation Tower, it could lead to countless opportunities for cultivation by major powers. This was the reason many fifth-realm martial artists attempted to break into The Reincarnation Tower, even if it meant destroying their foundations and retraining.

The top 100 or even the top 30 or 10 were unimaginable feats, with groups of Martial Emperors vying for the chance to become personal disciples. Li Chang Xang, once a marshal emperor, had taken in such a disciple, who became a successful marshal emperor herself.

As the huge black hole continued to tear apart space, the fluctuation of The Reincarnation Tower's opening spread, and countless wormholes formed. In just one night, the majority of civilized communities, including the human race, learned of the imminent opening of The Reincarnation Tower.

Tens of thousands of civilized groups, countless lives, and astronomical celestial Pride all went into a frenzy. The once-in-a-century madness event was about to begin once more.

At Blue Star, the great summer imperial capital star, countless geniuses gathered annually. Blue Star University, one of the leading institutions, accepted only the supreme geniuses among them. However, when news of The Reincarnation Tower reached them, students already planned to destroy their foundations and retrain.

The reason was simple: even among the same geniuses, there were gaps. Some were the strongest their planet had ever seen, unmatched and uncomparable. However, upon arriving at Blue Star University with confidence, they discovered they were almost at the bottom. The pride of their small place was reduced to a stepping stone for others.

Not only at Blue Star University but also in other slightly inferior universities, such as the Grandia Martial Arts Academy, Tien Wu Academy, and Star Martial Arts University, many students chose to retrace their cultivation path. The opportunity to break into The Reincarnation Tower was too rare, happening only once in a hundred years.

If they managed to rank in the top 100, Marshall Kings would vie for them, and for the top 30, not only Marshall Kings but also Marshall Emperors would fight for them. The cultivation resources they could obtain were incomparable to what they had now.

In addition to these geniuses who took the path of cultivation again, there were also many first-realm martial artists who suppressed their realms for 3 to 5 years or even 10 or more. They forced their realm to stay at the first realm, cultivating to the peak and great circle. This would have an impact on their subsequent cultivation, but it was all worth it to break into The Reincarnation Tower's top rankings.

This wasn't exclusive to the human race; other alien races employed similar methods. The collective pursuit of breaking into The Reincarnation Tower's top rankings led to a surge in cultivation efforts across the universe. Even Luu, who faced many obstacles according to his Master's words, found breaking into the top 100 challenging. However, the determination to succeed was stronger than ever.

The greater the challenge, the more motivated Luu became. After killing his way to the front, he could easily become famous throughout the universe. This filled Luu with motivation, and he began a month-long training from hell. Compared to others, what Luu lacked was not talent or qualifications; what he lacked was simply time. If the Reincarnation Tower were to open a year later, with his condition, killing his way into the top 10 would be much simpler. However, he was now only just starting to cultivate. This was also the reason why Bayyo did not look favorably on Luu. His cultivation time was too short. If he hadn't worshipped Xiaan Yuan, he wouldn't have even started practicing yet.
Because of this, neither Lu Chang Chang nor Bayyo had spoken to him about the news about the imminent opening of The Reincarnation Tower. After all, as the Marshall Saint's only son, he didn't lack the resources to cultivate, nor did he lack a Marshal Emperor Master, nor did he lack secret treasures. There was no need for Luu to be like those people who would break into The Reincarnation Tower at all costs. So, this Reincarnation Tower originally didn't have much to do with him until that mission came along. It was only then that Luu decided to make a break for it.
So much so that Lu Chang Chang froze when he returned home and heard the news. By Yuyo couldn't help but complain to him, "Little Luu is capricious and fooling around, and he, Xiaan Yuan, as a master, doesn't know how to stop it. Instead, he follows him around and customizes a special training program for him. Luu hasn't come home for several days now and I won't be able to see him for the next month."
When Lu Chang Shang heard these words, he just smiled and asked back, "Then, why did you agree to it in the first place?"
By Yuyo, who was asked rhetorically, was suddenly speechless and only said after a long time, "I just miss him. The child will grow up eventually. He's my son, and since he's going to break into The Reincarnation Tower, he'll have to get good grades. His master gave him special training. There's no problem."
Lu Chang Shang smiled faintly and said with some anticipation, "Let's just see how high he can fly this time."
Hearing this, By Yuyo wanted to speak but after a long while, she still nodded in a Flash. 15 days had passed. In Jaia's Wuan's Mansion, 10,000 Swords Pavilion, in the middle position, Luu sat on the futon. In this position, he felt like a tree in a Category 18 typhoon, swaying wildly, as if he was going to be uprooted in the next second. However, practicing here could be half the battle.
These days, Luu's schedule was Straight Up full, and he could no longer squeeze in a bit of time for realm cultivation, secret technique learning, combat awareness development, martial arts fighting skill training, and even that heartless Shia. When you could even, the time he spent sleeping was taken up. He used black hole meditation thoughts instead of sleep to not only replenish his sleep but also to grow his Marshal will.
Cultivate, cultivate, cultivate for 24 hours a day. Even the time he spent eating and drinking was spent practicing. There wasn't a single moment to spare. Luu felt like he was going crazy. He felt that he was not a human being but a cultivation machine. Even Xiao Jing suffered. He was dragged along with Luu and followed the cultivation together. During these days, Xiao Jing was tortured beyond recognition, but even so, he still gritted his teeth and persevered. He wants to prove himself too.
Luu couldn't help but find the master and say, "Wanting to be fast is not good. So intense cultivation is not good. To rest appropriately, ah, take a breath or not."
As a result, Jaia Wuan only glanced at him and said, "You're a marshall Saint? L you could only reply, 'No.' Jauanan said rightfully since you're not a marshall Saint, then listen to me. And it's not like we've been practicing like this all the time. It's just a month of special training. Do you know what special training means? Don't want to give me lazy."
What else could Luu say? Xia Wuan walked in from the side door. He looked at Luu and said indifferently, "You cannot need to cultivate today."
When Luu heard this, his heart was immediately delighted, but he immediately realized that things were definitely not that simple with his teacher's nature. He would never give him a day off. As expected, Xia Wanan continued, "You go and break into the Tower of Trials, then bring me back a first place."
The Tower of Trials? What did this have to do with The Reincarnation Tower? Hearing this, Luu hurriedly asked, "Then, if I get the rankings, won't I be crowding out other people's spots?"
Jauan glanced at him and said unflinchingly, "Do you think breaking into the Reincarnation Tower is a family game? What's the point of a bunch of Canon fodder going in? My opinion is that there are still too many spots right now."

And even half less wouldn't have any effect. Chapter 74: The Heat Is On

In fact, this audition had begun half a month ago. However, at that time, Fish and Dragons were a mixed bag of good and bad performers, and the intensity of the trial was too low. Therefore, Xiaoyuan Yuan had never even considered allowing Luu to compete. It wasn't until now, when the selection tournament had entered its second half and the competition had become intense, that he intended to let Luu go down to test the depths of the water. In fact, this wasn't just Xiaowuan's idea; many people had this idea. Even if they didn't need to obtain a Reincarnation Tower slot, they still plugged in to get an early warm-up. There was no doubt that this would crowd out some civilian martial artists, making it slightly unfair. But there is no such thing as absolute fairness in this world outside the universe, where even the weak and strong could not defeat those powerful children who had cut in. Even if you were lucky enough to go to the Reincarnation Tower, it wouldn't be much use. The original purpose of conducting selection trials in advance was to screen out true geniuses, and it was a normal situation for those with slightly lesser qualifications to be eliminated. Therefore, officials for such behavior simply turned a blind eye, considering it acceptable. These people who cut in line but only managed to get a fraction of a nine-cow's worth of slots understood the general situation. He couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. What a powerful class, what special treatment. Oh, I'm the biggest powerhouse of all, that's okay. But does Teacher mean that he wants me to take first place in Blue Star? He couldn't help but ask. Xiaowuan Yuan nodded. "It's up to your efforts in these ten days or so to take first place in the Blue Star under pressure." Luu nodded. If it was just a first-realm martial artist competing, it wouldn't be a problem for him to take first place. But this time, there were many former fifth-realm powerhouses among the participants, including many geniuses from Blue Star University and perverts who had suppressed their realms for more than ten years. The thing to know was that he had cultivated for a full month, not even a month. Even if he were to turn on his power, it would take time to grow. If you were really blindly confident and thought there was no enemy, you were really underestimating the heroes of this world. Even though this half month of cultivation had already allowed Luu to grow quite a bit, if he could get first place in the Blue Star, he would be able to secure the top spot. The difficulty of this could be very exaggerated. It was right to have pressure. To Luu's surprise, Xiaoyuan Yuan didn't mock his lack of confidence but calmly said, "Blue Star is the Great Summer Imperial Star, a place where countless geniuses gather. Many of them were able to defy the Sixth Realm Patriarch ARS when they were in the Fifth Realm, but even so, they all chose to destroy their foundations and recultivate. The difficulty is conceivable. Although I can look down on them, you absolutely can't look down on them or you'll be at a great disadvantage. However, you shouldn't have too much pressure. Forge ahead and fight recklessly. It's good if you can get the first place. If you can't get it, there's nothing you can do anyway. There's still more than half a month of time left, and you can continue to cultivate." Hearing this, Luu nodded heavily. "Good." Before entering the Tower of Trials, Luu finally gained a bit of rest time and couldn't help but let out a long sigh of relief. Xiao Jing, who was on the side, was like a dead dog, paralyzed on the ground, not even wanting to move. Luu also sat on the ground and opened his communication device, glancing at the message. In these fifteen days of seclusion, he had received many messages. There were parents and friends from the Dashia Heroes Group, even the Riverside Snow Jiang Bangu, who had obviously heard about Luu's closed-door cultivation and was preparing to break into the Reincarnation Tower, leaving a message to cheer him on. Luu replied one by one. Then, glancing at the messages from the Great Summer Heroes Group, there were no shortage of messages. At his own Luu took a general look and saw that this group of kid brothers was discussing the news of the Tower of Trials and asked Luu if he wanted to participate. Luu didn't think much about it and immediately said, "Of course, I want to participate." The moment Luu spoke, the originally quiet group instantly heated up. "Who is this boss? Is he out? Big Brother has finally spoken! Big Brother, I miss you so much! It feels like I haven't seen you for so many days. A day's absence separates three autumns; it feels like a lifetime has passed. Big Brother, how's your closed-door cultivation going? Big Brother was very powerful before, and this time when he's out of the gate, he's definitely even more powerful. But the difficulty of this trial is very high. Those geniuses from Blue Star University retracing their cultivation paths is simply a descending blow. Big Brother has to be careful. Are you going to join the Tower of Trials midway? I'm going to participate as well. Go and meet Big Brother Lu." Luu looked at the constantly refreshing messages and smiled slightly, continuing to reply, "My master wants me to come back with a Blue Star number one."

When these words were spoken, there was no doubt that it was like a huge stone thrown into a calm lake, instantly stirring up a thousand waves. The big guys understood Lu U's character; what the big brother says is law. If you don't have the confidence, you wouldn't dare say that. "Boss is mighty! Big Brother, for sure, can boss this. Blue Star number one is definitely ours!" I must watch this trial, just waiting for Big Brother to perform.

Lu U looked at the constantly scrolling messages and glanced at the progress of the fourth stage of the quest. With this confidence boost from Fong, the quest progress increased by another two points. It's currently at 86 out of 100. It's only 14 points left, however, the further back you go, the harder it gets. The point is, time is running out for the mission. At first, this side quest had a one-month deadline. Now, this month is all that remains. Under normal circumstances, it's basically impossible to complete it. However, next, Lu U participated in the Tower of Trials to test the depths of the Blue Star Celestial Pride. As long as he performed well, he might be able to complete this side quest. The reward for the fourth stage of the quest is the absolute best Heaven and Earth wonders. Once he obtained this treasure, when the time came, Lu U would undoubtedly be more certain when he went to break into The Reincarnation Tower again. So it seemed that this trial, the importance of which was self-evident, had to be played well.

Soon, the news that the Marshall Saint's only son had left the gate and participated in the Tower of Trials went viral in the circles of the Great Seas' top echelons. Even some Marshall Emperors were startled and came over to pay attention with interest. With the attention of these bigwigs, the One Realm Selection Tournament, which was originally very hot, was even more rapidly elevated at this moment, gradually coming to an unprecedented level. Of course, although the news of Lu U's participation had spread in the high-level circle, nothing was known outside the high-level circle. Even many great Masters were at a loss about this. It was just a trial selection for the first realm; why would so many Marshall Emperors be concerned? Out of curiosity, they too began to pay attention.



Chapter 75: Where did this child come from? Why does he look familiar?

With the attention of one Marshal Emperor after another, the winds of the outside world rose, and the heat of the trial became more and more exaggerated. Some people who originally didn't intend to participate, when they saw how lively it was, were instantly moved and one by one they all plugged in to participate in this trial.

"Marshall Saint's only son, I've heard that he's extremely talented, more than a demon. Let me try his success. Let's see if he's as Heaven-defying as the rumors say."

"He's only three years old, how far can he go against the heavens?"

"When I was in the fifth realm, even the Patriarchs were no match for me. I don't believe that I can't beat a three-year-old."

"After retracing my cultivation path, haha, you guys are going to bully kids. That's not very nice."

"That is, you participate, I participate."

"The original Tower of Trials of average difficulty has directly turned into the Little Reincarnation Tower. All going to a fish fry. I'll come along for the ride. I'll come, I'll come too."

"I've heard that this son of a Marshall Saint who worships a peak Marshall Emperor as his teacher. I'm afraid it's not simple. I just happened to see if it lives up to its name."

The Cheu family, after Chuong saw this news, his eyes revealed some surprise. "Having the guts, I didn't expect you to participate in this selection trial." Xuang said softly. "In that case, I will also participate. Let's see if we can engage you a little early." Saying so, Chuang's eyes were filled with anticipation. As a matter of fact, not only Chu Yang, there were quite a few more such people in the Great Summer Heroes group. Each and every one of them was the son of a Marshall Emperor, and their natural talent was even more Supreme. If they were placed outside, they could be called the dragon in Phoenix among men with thousands of favorites. But if they were placed in Heroes of the Grand, they were just a mediocre sand sculpture group. They have their own little minds. This time, the Tower of Trials is the opportunity.

Meanwhile, in the virtual world's oversized Plaza, there was a huge countdown right above it: 23 minutes and 9 seconds. 7 minutes had passed. The advanced preparation time is half an hour. If you are late for the future, you will automatically lose the opportunity to try out. At this moment, nearly a million people had gathered in...

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

Meanwhile, the oversized square was still growing in number at this very moment, and luu several people were in the High Altitude Supreme VIP room, surrounded by all kinds of equipment. The walls and floors of the room could be set to transparent, allowing them to clearly see the scene below. Luu and Xiao Jing were slightly surprised as they looked at the growing number of people below. After all, it was still the second half of the trial, and it was hard to imagine how many people would be in the addition round. As the countdown ticked down, the trial would soon begin. Soon, a light screen appeared in front of luu's eyes with a line of text displayed on it: "You are about to be teleported to the Tower of Trials. Do you accept?" There were three options below: "Accept," "Reject," and "Temporarily put on hold until the next match." Luu didn't hesitate and directly clicked "Accept." The light screen then changed, and the text on it read: "We are randomly matching opponents in battle maps. Please be patient." The matching time was fast, just a few seconds. Luu felt a blur in front of his eyes, and the scene around him had changed. This ruined street was filled with smoke, burning flames everywhere, and wailing sounds were coming from everywhere, as if it was a hell on earth. One by one, hideous-faced, slow-moving Heaven Fury corpses wandered aimlessly through the streets. At the same time, text prompts continued to appear before luu's eyes. "You have been teleported to the fourth level of the Tower of Trials, War Zone 3. The name of the theater is Purgatory Town. The total number of players in this theater is 10,000. The battle will start in 300 seconds. At this stage, players are invincible, so please be patient and wait for other players to join in." The rules of Purgatory Town were as follows: "Kill an ordinary Heaven Fury corpse and gain one point. Kill a Sky Fiend corpse (Elite) and gain 10 points. Kill a Heavenly Fury corpse (Kingmaker) and receive 100 points. For killing a player, half of the player's points will be awarded, or 10 points if that player has less than 20 points." The total time of the trial was 60 minutes, and after the trial was over, the players with the top 50 points would be promoted to the next level of the Tower of Trials. 

Meanwhile, with his knowledge of advanced virtual games, the setup in front of him was not unfamiliar. This was the latest technology from Blue Star, which could only temporarily recreate a virtual world, but not the virtual universe. Dasha had long mastered the quantum communication technology, but the massive amount of computation required for the virtual universe and the quantum communication technology at this stage still had its limitations. The virtual world could only replicate the seventh realm, and for the time being, it couldn't simulate the rule power, which meant that even if a Marshall Emperor with powerful abilities arrived in the virtual world, the maximum strength he could exert was at most at the seventh realm level. In short, there was still a lot of room for progress in human technology. However, there was no problem in providing a group of first-ranked martial artists with a trial ground. As luu was thinking about these things, not far away, a young man in his 20s or 30s, with an expression of surprise on his face, pointed at luu and couldn't help but open his mouth and say, "Where did this kid come from? Is this a place where people can come?" If it wasn't for the fact that luu's body was surrounded by a faint glow and was in an invincible state, he would have almost thought that this kid was an NPC. "I'm a participant, ah," luu said with a naive face, looking at the young man in front of him and asking, 'How about you, Uncle? You're so old, how come you're still in the first realm?' 

This old man immediately blushed with embarrassment and coughed. 'I was a fifth-ranked golden body martial artist before this,' he said, '...this is a retracing of the path of cultivation.' If so, then, Uncle, you have a big advantage," luu said with a nod. "No, there's no advantage anymore, because at this stage, everyone else is basically in the same situation as me. On the contrary, kids like you are few and far between. How did you get here?" the man asked with some curiosity. 'Me...,' luu said with a smile, 'I was allowed to come by arrangement with my family.' That's when a thought suddenly popped into the man's mind. "Ah, that's at least 10 points."

Here is the improved text:

Isn't that a score for nothing? Can a kid that big resist with his sword, which is taller than the others? It's hilarious to see him surrounded by malice. Luu seemed oblivious to them, continuing to observe his surroundings as the countdown to the battle ticked by, minute by minute. The men leaned in unison, all wanting to take the 10 points for nothing. However, some people noticed that something was off, and they felt that this matter was not as simple as it seemed. They found Luu to be inexplicably familiar, and they hastily retreated, not wanting to get involved in this muddy water. No one bothered to stop them, and the place of trial was already cruel to the extreme, with nothing but boredom and leisure time ahead for doled-out justice. This was also a virtual world, so it was perfectly fine to die. As time passed, more and more people surrounded Luu, staring at him as if he was mere prey. Each one had eyes of gold, fair play, and warned, "Don't mess this up. Whoever gets to him first gets it." These people had begun to communicate completely, treating Luu as a meal on a plate. They even had the uncle who had spoken to Luu earlier among them, who looked at Luu greedily and secretly thought to himself, "You don't blame me. This place of trial is meant for the weakest to be crushed by the strongest. You'd better die under me." Time passed by second after second, and there were only 10 seconds left before the Invincible state was about to end. They had completely surrounded Luu, and now they couldn't even leave if they wanted to. It was only then that Luu turned around, and from his waist, a sword emerged that was longer than the others. He slowly pulled it out and smiled at the crowd. "You guys want to challenge me? It's quite smart of you to know that you can't give it away one by one. So, you choose to go together." Hearing these words, the atmosphere which was still tense, instantly became strange. The faces of the crowd were in shock, never dreaming that Luu would say such words. Someone couldn't help but let out a laugh, followed by hahahaha, wild laughter that was so much so that their stomachs began to hurt. "This little kid is so funny," someone said. Luu looked at the group laughing, tilted his head in confusion, and wondered, "What's so funny about it? Don't they recognize themselves yet?" Yes, it should be compared to the good boy image of his last TV appearance. Luu, who had been practicing for a month, was like a different person. He slowly pulled the long sword from his waist and looked around at the people surrounding him. A brief count brought the total to 13, meaning 130 points. 10 seconds flew by, and the invincibility was about to disappear. The youth standing at the front condescendingly looked down at Luu and grinned. "Although I don't know where you got your confidence, I still have to tell you that this trial land is not a place for you to play around. Since you're the son of a powerful man, stay in your own home and watch the show." After these words, someone took the lead, not wanting to chat and grab points. This person quickly rushed to Luu's body and didn't hesitate to swing his sword. However, the knife did not hit Luu but cut directly on the ground. Luu didn't know when he had disappeared, leaving the attackers bewildered.

Ha, the Man's eyes widened, and he was just about to raise his head to look for someone when he suddenly felt his head sink. A pair of feet stepped on his head, and Luu stood on this man's head, looking down at the remaining 12. When these people saw this scene, they raised their heads, dismay written all over their faces. It wasn't until this moment that they finally realized that things weren't simple – yet it was obviously too late to realize that something was wrong. Luu just stepped on it, and the head of the man under his feet was immediately stepped into his chest cavity, and the man was dead. This was the power of the natural dragon and tiger – even if these people had once been fifth realm Martial Masters that was only once, and having retraced the path of cultivation, they had lost the vast majority of their power, retaining only a strong sense of combat and martial will. These people were naturally crushed on all fronts when facing ordinary first realm Martial artists. But unfortunately, they had met Luu. If he was a peak fifth realm recultivated with the Dharma body remaining, it might still allow Luu to be a bit more cautious. However, these people were just ordinary fifth realm, and it was no match for Luu. For example, this person at Luu's feet had been eliminated for no apparent reason, without even being able to use his own bottom card. Luu jumped up high, and along with the man falling to the ground with a loud crash, he swung his sword down, slicing off another man's head. This person also knew that it was not good; his scalp was tingling, and he just wanted to resist, but suddenly his complexion was in a trance, and the movement of his hand slowed down by half a beat. In the next instant, a head flew high in the air. This is the Red Dust sword technique, and the moment the sword is discharged, it can affect the opponent's mental state to a certain extent.

Even if one had once been in the fifth realm, and their willpower was strong enough to resist being drawn into the illusion, they could still be momentarily entranced in a life and death battle. This instant was enough to alter the course of the battlefield. Lu, wandering above the tip of the blade, frantically reaped lives; in the blink of an eye, 13 people had died, their corpses falling at his feet. Lu's body and sword remained unstained by even half a drop of blood, as if nothing had happened. He calmly looked at the older man who had approached him at the beginning and asked with a smile, "What were you thinking? Did you have to come over to give away points, just like them?"

The older man looked at the scene in front of him with his jaw dropped. He stared blankly at Lu and an image suddenly flashed through his mind. "You are...you turned out to be you," he finally remembered why he thought the kid looked so familiar. He was actually the only son of the Marshall Saint, Blue Lu. It was a shame that it was too late to think about it now, as the last head rolled to the ground.

The Marshal artists watching from afar each looked at each other with horror in their eyes. Fortunately, they had sensed that something was wrong and did not want to take risks for this one head, retreating in advance. Otherwise, they all would have died under the sword of this child. But where in the world did this monster come from? This was too scary.

Suddenly, they felt Lu's gaze sweeping over them, and one by one, their faces stiffened and their scalps tingled. Then, without the slightest hesitation, they turned around and ran.

This chapter is a bounty plus chapter 77, Celestial Being. Jang Bangu sat in the arms of the beautiful woman, probing at the TV program and chirping. The beautiful woman touched Jang Bangu's head and explained, "Although this is the second half of the trial selection, the number of participants is still as high as more than 2 million. There are more than 200 war zones, and there are countless battles occurring at every moment. Even if the TV station has a lot of guides, there's no way to cut to the footage that you want. Wait until the later stages of the finals, and you should have the footage you want."

Despite what she said, the beautiful woman actually didn't think much of Lu. Even if he had a high level of talent, his age was a hard fact, and his cultivation time was too short. How could he compare to those who had recultivated at the fifth realm? What's more, among the contestants this time, there are also some peaks of the fifth realm who still have a portion of their Dharma bodies remaining.

Just as she was thinking this, she suddenly heard the little girl exclaim, "It's coming! It's coming! Brother Lu's picture!" Hearing this, the beautiful woman froze for a moment and hurriedly looked up at the picture on the screen. Then, she saw a killing scene that was like art, and in just a split second, more than a dozen people were beheaded one after another. "What a fast sword," the beautiful woman's pupils shrunk slightly, and she couldn't help but open her mouth, unable to believe her eyes for a moment.

In the middle of the screen, Lu's tiny figure formed an extremely sharp contrast with the dozen or so corpses that had fallen successively. Because it was a trial Battlefield and not an ordinary virtual game, after the players were eliminated, their broken bodies were still lying on the ground and did not disappear immediately. This bloody scene made the beautiful woman a little worried that her daughter was feeling uncomfortable. But as a result, she looked down and saw that Jang Bangu was applauding excitedly with her eyes glowing. "Brother Lu is really great!" the American woman said, realizing that she was the one who was overthinking it.

In the meantime, the host in charge of the commentary had an excited look on his face and shouted with an exuberant expression, "The picture of this battle is from the absolute Heavenly pride of Battle Zone 3, and I believe that many of the viewers in the screen should have already guessed his identity. The greatest hero in the history of mankind, the only son of the 10 realms Marshall Saint, Lu, look! He easily eliminated 13 opponents. This is already the second half of the genius selection tournament, and those who have fallen without exception are all fifth realm heavy cultivators. Yet, under Lu's sword, they were actually no match at all. They couldn't even resist a single move. The battle ended one-sidedly. I really can't believe my eyes. It is said that this Marshall Saint's only son has been cultivating for less than a month. Is this a genius? No, genius is simply not enough to describe him. He's only 3 years old. It's too terrifying. I can only say that it's worthy of being the Marshall Saint's only son. This is truly Heavenly. With this kind of talent and this kind of strength, the future is bound to be unlimited. Talking too far, let's go back to the trial Battlefield. After eliminating 13 people at the current stage of the third Battlefield, Lu's points ranking ranked first. A ranking then appeared in the upper right corner of the screen, ranging from the 1st to the 20th place, with the ranks behind it shifting almost every minute.

Every second, except for the first, Luu was leading by a moment, as steady as a mountain. This was normal, after all. One could only gain 100 points by killing a Heaven's Fury Corpse King that possessed third-order strength. A normal Heaven's Fury Corpse mini-monster was even only worth one point. In a short period of time, it would be hard for anyone to surpass Luu.

As the host in charge of the commentary made this impassioned announcement, it directly caused a furor. Not many people knew about it because Jia Wuan had made up his mind on the spur of the moment to allow Luu to participate. At this moment, when the news of the Marshall Saint's only son participating in the Tower of Trials spread, the already extremely hot broadcast of the Tower of Trials was directly adding fuel to the fire. Even those ordinary people who didn't care about this selection match were a bit unable to calm down after hearing this news.

"Marshall Saint's only son, how old is he to go to the Tower of Trials? Yeah, I remember it's only three years old, right? Going to the Tower of Trials isn't that giving it away. That's right, even if his talent is great, it's impossible for him to compare to those who are heavily cultivated at the fifth realm, right?" That was their first reaction when they heard the news.

However, soon after realizing that Luu had killed 13 people in a single moment, each one of them widened their eyes and exclaimed, "Truly worthy of being the son of a Marshall Saint." There were some, however, whose first thought was, "Fake race, definitely a fake match. As much as I hate to say it, it's a fake match. It seems impossible to explain it away except as a fake match. That's right, those people are fifth realm heavy cultivators, or 13 of them, and they can't beat a three-year-old child. What kind of joke is that? Going up there and giving away 13 heads is this not even an act. This is too fake."

As the news spread, Luu's stunning performance was immediately labeled as a fake match by a group of conspiracy theorists. Even though they hadn't even bothered to look at it, their inherent self-consciousness allowed them to directly decide that it was a fake match. "After all, it's just too fake. What kind of three-year-old child can defeat a fifth realm heavy cultivator? Even if he was gifted and extraordinary, it was already remarkable that he was able to defeat a fifth realm heavy cultivator. But he had killed 13 of them as soon as he came up. Was that not false? Even if he is the son of the Marshall Saint, it can't be that great, can it?"

Conspiracy theories spread very quickly. Just for a while, all kinds of questioning voices could be said to rise and fall, especially in these years, the polarization of the upper and lower classes. These people were already dissatisfied, and at this moment, it was even more direct to take advantage of the issue. While they certainly didn't dare to question the Marshall Saint and belittle him, the son of the Marshall Saint wasn't a Marshall Saint. So this kind of fake match behavior was simply discrediting the Marshall Saint. They even justified their actions, saying it was to defend the honor of the Marshall Saint. For the powerful special class to engage in this kind of tawdry maneuver was simply an insult to their intelligence.

But soon, when this reached the ears of the spectators who had been watching the entire match, these people were instantly displeased and began to retort, "Fake race, what kind of joke is that? You didn't watch the game. You just opened your mouth, didn't you? Isn't it a bit much to call this a fake game when you guys haven't even watched the game yet? Yeah, why don't you at least go online and search the live clips before you comment, true or false? Look at the heart. Have a number. If even did not see it, put here to bring rhythm. That is either stupid or bad. But anyone who went to see the game wouldn't have said that. To be honest, if I hadn't watched this match and suddenly heard this news, I'm afraid I'd be of the same mind as you guys. However, after I watched the whole thing, I can only sigh with emotion that he deserves to be the only son of the Marshall Saint. I also think he's ridiculously strong. But once I think about being the son of a martial Saint, everything makes sense."

After being rebutted, the conspiracy theorists struck back with, "Here comes the water army. Here comes the water army. So soon, don't insult my intelligence." For a while, the two sides could be said to be arguing and quarreling. But also, for this trial of the Tower of the selection of the war, it added another heat.

Chapter 78: "I'm not targeting anyone. I mean everyone here is trash." In this era, the blue star, as the great summer Imperial Star, had a total population of roughly 20 billion. As the saying goes, people come in all shapes and sizes. In a 100, not to mention this huge base of 20 billion people, there are almost all types of people with huge numbers of people. Even the silliest of topics can get many responses online. Some so-called pacifists even condemn the heroes who defended the human race online, saying that they were war criminals and that the other alien races in the universe were peace-loving and had only been invaded by the humans. So they were forced to fight back. These people call for humans to return the planet and make peace with the Fai so that there will be no more wars or deaths in the future.

Even such stupid statements garner numerous fans and are considered unassailable truths. Not to mention Luu's amazing performance, which has sparked controversy, questions, and even accusations of fakery from conspiracy theorists. When refuted, these individuals insist they are right. The internet is abuzz with noise, and the heat of this controversy continues to rise. Currently, there are close to 10 billion viewers who have watched the game consecutively, with a staggering 5 billion watching online simultaneously.

It is important to note that this was only a preliminary battle for the Tower of Trials and not the Tower of Reincarnation, where all races compete. Yet, as more viewers tuned in, the broadcast team was shocked by the unprecedented level of excitement. The Marshall Saint's son, Lu U, is the reason for this heat. His fame requires no introduction and is considered a household name in the human community across a thousand living planets. As the only son of the Marshall Saint, he is the subject of much attention, but is rarely seen in public. His appearance in the Tower of Trials has caused a significant increase in concern and excitement.

The guides, responsible for the broadcast, quickly realized the core reason for the high level of heat - Lu U's presence. They unanimously decided to cut to War Zone 3 to capture Luu's footage. At the moment, Luu was standing on the roof of a 12-story building, looking down on the scene below with a disdainful demeanor. This condescending posture, combined with his tender face and small body, formed a striking contrast. The audience could feel Luu's disdainful attitude through the screen, as if none of the contestants in this battle zone were worth his attention.

The viewers were excited and frantically launched pop-ups, praising Luu's proud look. Meanwhile, the camera shifted to the scene below, where the flames of the surrounding ruins continued to burn. Ten minutes had passed, and players had been hunting around to kill the Heavenly Fury corpses for points. However, the Heavenly Fury corpses fought back, and under the organization of the Heavenly Fury corpse King, the Heavenly Fury corpse tide was unleashed. Players were scattered and could only be whisked around like lost dogs. Some players realized that they needed to take care of the Heavenly Fury corpse King, but due to the constraints of the rules, they didn't dare to give their backs to others.

Amidst players attempting to unite proving impossible, they resorted to infighting while evading the Heaven's Fury corpses. The players' side hadn't even united, but the Heavenly Fiend Corpse King intervened, as the Heavenly Fiend corpses were inefficient. The Sky Fiend Corpse King, resembling a small mountain, moved swiftly, causing the ground to tremble. As a third-ranked monster, he nearly overpowered all players in one-sided kills.

Some players, resurrected from the dead as fifth-realm heavy cultivators, fought back despite their inability to defeat the third-order strength Sky Fiend Corpse King. They had their own strategies, but their desperate strikes only enraged the Sky Fiend Corpse King further.

When the berserk Heavenly Fiend Corpse King roared, players panicked and fled. Luu, however, remained unfazed. He casually drew his long sword as the audience watched in disbelief. The Sky Fiend Corpse King, in a berserk state close to the peak of the third rank, was almost invincible on the battlefield.

Defying expectations, Luu didn't retreat but instead drew his sword. The audience reacted with shock, anticipation, admiration, and excitement. Some questioned his sanity, while others praised his courage.

In a flash, Luu leapt towards the Sky Fiend Corpse King, displaying a sword power that surpassed the standardized weapon he held. The Heavenly Fiend Corpse King realized the danger and tried to resist, but Luu's speed and sword technique were too fast. He executed a sword move taught by Sword Emperor Jaan Yuan, decapitating the Sky Fiend Corpse King in an instant.

Despite the initial one-sided advantage, the battle ended with Luu's unexpected victory.

In this scene, as Luu decapitated the Heavenly Fury Corpse King's head with a single sword stroke, all the viewers were left stunned. Each one of them had their mouths wide open, as if they could fit an apple. Even those who were aware of Luu's power beforehand had not expected him to be able to do this. The impact of this image was simply too great, causing them to be speechless.
The audience, who were full of doubts about Luu at this moment, could no longer believe their eyes. In the moment Luu jumped down, they even thought that the Heavenly Fury Corpse King would swallow this child in one mouthful. However, they never dreamed that Luu would be able to solve the Heavenly Fury Corpse King with a single sword off the charts. This is outrageous.
This kind of feeling, as if the atmosphere is tense, like a boss level in a game. The boss's blood bar makes people scalp numb, the value makes people dumbfounded, but the result is suddenly rushed out. Alv, one small character, a flat A, a will almost full blood. The boss is now at the second level. This is absolutely open to hang it.
These people subconsciously wanted to question it, yet Luu's speed, sword Chi, sword momentum, and that terrifying sword just now were definitely not something that could be explained by the simple word cheating. To cross over and kill a third-order Heavenly Fiend Corpse came with the posture of the first realm, this kind of celestial posture was enough to make everyone gasp in awe and be convinced.
In this moment, the previous rumors of a fake match turned directly into a joke, a special operation for the powerful, a fake race to fool people. I just can't help but blush a little when I think of all the things that were once said and those viewers who had retorted for Luu after the sword chop immediately got on their mouths and asked those people to come out and continue to face each other. Let's see if you guys can continue to bark. Bark again to hear ah no doubt deleting posts, playing dead, slipping, and kneeling. How would anyone dare to continue the thread? Slightly tougher, mouth immediately be group ridiculed. Not a little power to fight back and then scolded to drop small pearls in front of the TV screen.
The little chubby Pin Yun applauded excitedly, then proudly exclaimed, "My big brother is also too powerful. It really deserves to be my big brother." The middle-aged man on the side couldn't help but glance at this little guy when he heard this.
No how amazing Luu's play is has nothing to do with you. Why are you so proud of me? The little chubby Pin Yun Li, however, did not feel embarrassed at all and turned his head to look at the middle-aged man and asked, "Dad, my big brother is awesome, right? It's awesome!"
Shinon nodded and praised, "To be able to perfectly use the extreme luminescent sword likee with the stance of the first realm, this kind of talent, this kind of qualification is truly breathtaking. Extreme Lumen sword light, what is that?" The little tubby froze for a moment and hurriedly asked Shin Yong, "Shin Yong, what is that?"
Shin Yong explained, "Jiao sword Emperor set of famous stunts. The luminescent sword light is just one of them. Even though it's an introductory move, it's really a bit of an exaggeration for a first-realm martial artist to be able to learn it. I really didn't expect Lou won's son's sword talent to be so powerful. No wonder the sword Emperor Xiao, who had been silent for so long, couldn't help himself and directly accepted him as his disciple. With this kind of Sword talent, it wouldn't be too much to say that it's astonishing."
Shen Yunai seldom heard his dad praising others so much. His eyes widened as he asked once again, "Then, will Big Brother be able to get first place in the Tower of Trials?" Shin Yun thought for a moment and said, "This kind of strength, if placed in the past, taking the first place is simply not too easy. But he put the word out and drew a lot of people to the table. The fierce competition for the top 10 of the Tower of Trials this time around is I'm afraid unprecedented. So, it's still an open question as to what the outcome will be."
I really didn't expect that the little Tower of Trials would be so exciting, interesting, and interesting. Shin Yunai subconsciously nodded as he listened to his father's words, then glanced at the heroes of the Granda group along with Luu's sword. The group had completely exploded at this moment. Countless messages are being frantically refreshed.
Chapter 80: First in the Three Regions - Celestial Pride gathered in the heroes of dashia chat group. A group of sand sculptured groupies were so excited after seeing the broadcast, as with the little fat Pin Yun Li. One is proud and honored at this moment. The messages were constantly refreshing, but in an instant, the chat messages were already $9.99 plus. Good lord, it's more lively than New Year's Eve.

The following people started copying and pasting again. Many copied messages were followed by a new phrase: "This era belongs to Big Brother." Good lord, it's back on repeat, again and again and again. Shin Yun Li saw this and couldn't help but be a little speechless. These people are repeaters, unable to discuss properly. I said, how, just a moment of effort, directly dry to 999 plus. Feelings came like this. Soon after, Shin Yun Li flipped to the latest chat message and someone posted, "Boss, this sword is really too cool." The result was a series of identical messages immediately below. When Shin Yun Li saw this, he wanted to stand up and shout, "Stop being a repeater, let's all have a good discussion." His fingers slipped, accidentally copied and pasted, and then sent it out, also becoming a happy repeater.

Marshall Saints' residence. Lu Chang Chang had a rare free moment to go home. At the moment, Bay Yuya was sitting in front of the TV watching the live broadcast of the Tower of Trials. When she saw that Luu had successively killed 133 people and ranked first in the three regions, surprise was written all over her face. Little Luu is actually so powerful, Bay Yuya said with great surprise, then couldn't help but glance at Lu Chang Chang. As a result, Lu Chang Chang just nodded with a calm face, as if it was a matter of course. Bay Yuya froze, feeling as if she was making a fuss. However, soon after, when Luu swung out his luminescent sword and killed the third-ranked monster with a single stroke, Bay Yuya once again widened her eyes and couldn't help but sigh in awe. Little Luu, this is too powerful. This time, this performance is enough to call it amazing. With the posture of the first realm, he chopped off the head of a third-ranked monster with a single sword, ending the battle in an instant. Such a performance was one of only a handful, even in the entire human race. Moreover, those people had either purposely suppressed their Realms or had retraced their cultivation paths at the peak of the fifth realm. But Luu was the only one who, after only a month of cultivation, had already made it this far. This made Bay Yuya and all others completely not expecting her son to display such a world-unrivalled appearance. Bay Yuya couldn't help but take another look at Lu Chang Chang, and it turned out that his expression was still calm, only a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. A look of relief, Bay Yuya thought, Little Luu has only been practicing for a month and he killed a third-order monster with one sword. Aren't you surprised? Not at all. It seems as if he already knew this. How many other things are these two hiding from each other? Bay Yuya felt a little strange. Previously, it was obviously her who had been accompanying Luu all the time, while Lu Chang Chang could only come back almost once a month. So how did it turn out that he knew Luu better than she did? You've known this for a long time, Bay Yuya couldn't help but ask. No, Lu Chang Chang asked a little strangely, You already knew that Luu was so powerful, yet you didn't tell me. Were you planning to see my scared silly expression? Bay Yuya couldn't help but complain. When Lu Chang Chang heard this, he smiled and shook his head. Of course not. I didn't realize previously that he was already this powerful. Then you're not surprised either, Bay Yuya couldn't help but say. He is my Lu Chang Chang son, isn't it normal to have such a skill? Lu Chang Chang said so with a proud expression on his face. Bay Yuya froze when she heard these words taken for granted. After a long while, she said, In that case, it seems that I'm the only one who doesn't have much confidence in him. Bay Yuya thought of half a month ago when little Luu had told her that he was going to participate in this reincarnation Tower trial and that he was going to top the list. I want the 10,000 races of the universe to know that the son of a Marshall Saint has an unlimited future, she had felt at that time. Bay Yuya thought that the little guy was too blindly confident, but it was not good to continue to fight, so she perfunctorily passed with a sentence of cheer. Who would have thought that Luu would have traveled to this height without even realizing it? No wonder he was able to put out that bravado. What's wrong? Lu Chang Chang saw the change in Bay Yuya's complexion and hurriedly asked. Bay Yuya then talked about what happened before. When Lu Chang Chang heard these words, the smile on his face grew a little whiter. Yes, yes, yes, so true, truly the Grandeur Rises. I want to compete with the god of Heaven, A Genius of the 10,000 Clans. So, he is my Lu Chang Chang son. The 60-minute battle was over quickly, with one 753 points. Luu easily placed first and advanced directly to the final stage. More than 200 War zones, 10,000 people in each war zone, and only 50 people advanced. So, the war zone for the finals was also almost at 10,000 people. Compared to the uneventfulness of the third battle zone, the Battle Zone of the finals would be extremely intense. At that time, more than 200 War zones, all the top Geniuses gathered together. There was no doubt that these 10,000 or so people were the true top Geniuses of Blue Star.

The battle, just thinking about it, made one's blood boil. The final of the Tower of Trials was in 30 minutes, but Luu was already looking forward to it. As he exited War Zone 3, Luu glanced at the system panel in the virtual world. The system could also be seen; Fong had quite a few highlight moments in the third battlefield, and with his special status, he should be captured by the camera and broadcasted. Doing so might be possible to gain some recognition and increase the progress bar for the fourth stage of the quest. Thinking so, Luu hastened to take a look. Sure enough, the current mission progress was 95/100, with only five points of progress missing. If Luu completed this fourth stage of the ultimate quest, he would be able to obtain the absolute best Heaven and Earth wonders. He had to say, it wasn't easy. He had been grinding away for almost a month before and after, and there was finally hope that it would be accomplished soon.

Luu left the third battle zone and returned to the VIP room where Xiao Wuan was. Xiao Jing had already returned here and looked at Luu with an adoring face as he hurriedly said, "Big brother, you're back!"

Luu nodded and then asked, "How are you doing?"

"He he he," Xiao Jing laughed and hurriedly said, "Not as good as big brother's first place. I'm 49th, barely advancing to the finals."

"Not bad," Luu was a bit surprised to be honest. He hadn't really expected Xiao Jing to be able to advance after all, it was now the second half of the Tower of Trials, and the intensity was very considerable. It was easy for him, but not so easy for Xiao Jing. The fact that he was able to fight his way out of such a situation was proof of his strength. But on second thought, it was right. After all, he was the son of the Marshall Emperor; his talent was already considered top-notch compared to normal people, and these days of hellish training, Xiao Jing also gritted his teeth and stuck to it, naturally growing a lot.

"Needless to say, I just had better luck," Xiao Jing said with some embarrassment. It wasn't just his strength that allowed him to advance; it was also somewhat related to his luck. Without the last wave of pickups, it would have been impossible to advance.

"Luck is also part of strength," Luu said without thinking. "Although I say so, with a strength like mine, once I enter the final battlefield, I'll be cannon fodder." Xiao Jing said with a bitter smile.

"Don't think too much. The finals start in half an hour. Take a good rest and adjust your condition first," Luu shook his head.

"Good," Xiao Jing nodded.

Master Luu turned his head to look at Xiao Wuan and smiled as he opened his mouth to ask, "How did I do just now?"

Xiao Wuan, who was on the side, still had a calm face. When he heard this, he just nodded and said, "It's not bad." This evaluation was rather reluctant, after all, in his opinion, this match was nothing more than a small test. With Luu's strength, it was simply too stable to be true, and basically, there would be no accidents.

Luu raised an eyebrow and couldn't help but ask, "Didn't Master see me use the extreme luminescent sword light?"

"You've been practicing hard for 15 days, and you can use the sword. Is it very impressive?" Xiao Wuan glanced at him.

Luu skimmed his lips. Fine, he also knew that Master had never been a knife-mouth tofu heart, and it was simply not too difficult to get him to compliment him into his face. "So it looks like it's just a matter of getting to the final battlefield and putting on a good show."

Luu sat down on the sofa to rest and casually read the news on the internet. With the end of this battle in the Tower of Trials and the imminent final stage, the heat was at an all-time high, and discussion threads could be seen everywhere. The most numerous of them were naturally posts about Marshall Saint's only son, Luu. He killed the third-rank monsters with a single sword, and the ease with which he traveled throughout was considered by many to be the champion seed for the final of this Tower of Trials. Many netizens marveling and praising in all kinds of ways, simply wanting to praise Luu to the sky.

Luu then glanced at the Heroes of the Great Summer chat group. Naturally, there is no need to say more in the group. A group of sand sculpture groupmates madly repeating words of praise, constantly blowing Luu's rainbow farts as if the champion of the Tower of Trials is already his bag. In general, however, the sand sculpture groupmates blew too much. Not to mention the first of the human race, even the first of the universe came. It was as if that reincarnation Tower had all become Luu's exclusive stage with all sorts of supreme rewards that had been booked in advance. Nice guy Luu did not dare to open the champagne in advance. Sand sculpture friends to help him open.

Seeing this, Luu couldn't help but shake his head. The current him was under pressure to take the number one spot in the human race, let alone the number one spot in the universe. Instead of being swept away by the pomp and circumstance, he came to his senses at once. "If you are really blind to everything, then you underestimate the heroes of the world."

Luu returned to his senses and hurriedly searched the internet for the...

Here is the improved English text, maintaining the original meaning without additions or shortenings:

Information he needed, however, was readily available because there are over 200 battlefields, but only one shot of the broadcast basically every shot is a very colorful battle. Then, the wizened host categorized the players expected to win the title from these shots, and Luu is one of them. The reason for picking him is simple. Even though he was very young and had only been cultivating for a short while, lacking the advantage of a Dharma body, he had already mastered Emperor Jian's extreme luminescent sword light, and his battle prowess could be considered extraordinary. So, he had a certain probability of winning the title. When Luu saw this, he couldn't help but be a little surprised. He didn't expect this categorized nison to actually know about the extreme luminescent sword light. It had to be said that no matter if it was physical insight or visual insight, it was very good. Luu nodded and hurriedly looked at the other players who were expected to win the championship. In a situation where the strengths were equal, obtaining intelligence information was quite crucial. Other than him, those who were expected to win the championship were basically all Dharma body powerhouses. A Dharma body is the higher state of the golden body after the fifth realm. Powerhouse, after casting the golden body, has finished, and the next step is their own martial arts method, which is melted into the golden body, thus forming the Dharma body. Any Dharma body Powerhouse was in existence at the peak of the fifth Rank and it was expected to condense its Dharma phase and break through the sixth rank to become a patriarch Powerhouse. Of course, after they retraced the path of cultivation, their golden bodies were completely shattered, and their Dharma bodies became broken, and they could only utilize a very small portion of their original strength. However, even with a broken Dharma body in the first realm, it was basically an existence that walked horizontally. Luu carefully looked at these people's information, silently memorizing their names, looks, Dharma attributes, and special abilities. Jong Donga Jing Xi Xiaojin Zongi Wu Hong Jaa Jun Siai Shuang Xuang. Why do you still see the name of an acquaintance? Luu unexpectedly raised an eyebrow. It has a detailed description of the information. The Chu family had produced three Marshall Emperors. Shu Yangang, as the only son of the Chu family's contemporary family head, was very talented, and for the sake of this reincarnation Tower, he had forcibly suppressed his realm for three or four years. Although his performance in the battle just now wasn't exactly eye-catching, he easily Advanced to the first place, and both his strength and underlying strength should not be underestimated. Therefore, he was judged to be seated for the championship. Luu couldn't help but smile when he saw this. Luu was looking forward to touching him on the battlefield of the finals. Time passed quickly, and the break was only 30 minutes. It passed in a flash. The final battle of the Tower of Trials was about to begin. When the competition reached this stage, it was already not only the locals of Blue Star who were paying attention; even people from other planets were also paying attention. After all, compared to the high-quality duel in the Blue Star Tower of Trials, their home planet selection trial was not worth mentioning at all. Gradually, the heat of this final was no longer limited to the Blue Star. It began to expand to the entire Grand Seat and even the entire human Community. Even people from other countries also cast their eyes over. Under the countless gazes of anticipation, the finals of the Tower of Trials officially began.

Chapter 82: Final Battlefield

I found you a curtain of light appeared before Luu's eyes. "You are about to be teleported to the final Battlefield of the Tower of Trials. Do you accept?" This time, there are only two choices: "down" to accept, or "rejected". Luu did not hesitate and directly tapped "accept". This time, there was no buffering or waiting. Luu was directly transported to the final Battlefield with a flash in front of his eyes. So fast, Luu was a little surprised, and immediately looked around. It was an icy wasteland with clouds shrouding the large mountains in the distance, surrounded by bushes and piles of rocks everywhere. It's deserted and uninhabited. The wind was howling more than a little. The sky was dripping with a bit of snow, and the temperature was around zero. In the distant clouds, a group of large white birds could be vaguely seen flying around their circumference. They were even surrounded by Electric Light. At a glance, it was clear that they were not mortal creatures. At the same time, text prompts appeared before Luu's eyes. "You have been teleported to the fifth level of the Tower of Trials. The first battle Zone is the Northern Wastes. The name of the theater is the Northern Wastes. The total number of players in this theater is 13,150. The battle will begin in 300 seconds. And at this stage, the player is invincible. The rules of the Northern Wastes are as follows: Kill a Rock Thunderbird and receive 50 points. Kill a Rock Thunderbird King and gain 1,000 points. If you kill a player, you will receive half of that player's points. If that player has less than 20 points, you will automatically receive 10 points. Players may choose to abstain and simply exit the final Battlefield. Abstaining will result in a loss of 50% of their current points. It is important to note that within a certain amount of time of a battle with a player, it is not possible to choose to forfeit. The total duration of the trial is 3 hours. Please enjoy the hunt and kill." The final stage, as opposed to before, has an additional rule: "forfeit". However, you can't abstain from fighting a player for a certain amount of time or or else.

It was impossible not to fight and then abstain, leaving the other player without any points. The officials had obviously taken this into account after Luu finished reading the rules. He looked up again and a number of people appeared around him one after another. When these people saw Luu, their faces changed and without the slightest hesitation, they turned around and ran. Luu couldn't help but laugh, wondering if he was that scary. But why did everyone seem so frightened when they looked at him? While some people feared him, others didn't. These people, mostly the sons and daughters of powerful nobles, had inserted themselves into the Tower of Trials to test Luu's depths and see how accomplished the son of the Marshall Saint was.

They had been participants in this Tower of Trials, hoping to see if Luu was as heaven-defying as the rumors had claimed. Each one of them had demonstrated extraordinary strength, able to battle against Zone Master powerhouses and even defeat some Zone Masters, but now had chosen to re-cultivate their path to get the top places in The Reincarnation Tower and obtain the Supreme treasure. For them, joining the Tower of Trials was just a way to have some fun. Now, having teleported here one by one, they were like travelers, wandering around, looking for a target with no hint of pressure at all. As time passed, their invincibility soon came to an end.

Many players looked around, all pondering this question: Was it a hunt, or was it killing? The Rock Thunderbird flew too high to fly, and without a long-range weapon, it could only stare for a moment, suggesting that this level was encouraging players to fight each other. Just when players were thinking this, the mutation was sudden. Amidst the clouds, the flock of Rock Thunderbirds spotted the humans and without the slightest hesitation, they swooped down. They swooped down extremely fast, almost at the speed of sound. Only once they got a little closer did the players realize how huge it was, with a pair of wings spread out, more than 10 ft wide and covering the sky. As they swooped down unstopably, almost all the players panicked, trying to escape.

A realm can't be any faster than the speed of sound. Hiding on top of the Wilderness, there was no cover, just a bunch of low bushes and nowhere to hide. All the players were gripped by fear, tightly clutching their weapons in their hands. Soon after, when the Rock Thunderbird swooped down, it simply grabbed the player with a light grip, as casually as an eagle would grasp a chicken. The players struggled and waved their weapons in their hands, trying to cut off the cloth of the Rock Thunderbird, but their efforts were futile.

As a result, when the Rock Thunderbird's claws cut into their weapons, the sound was like iron striking another iron, and sparks flew everywhere. Cutting off the claws and leaving behind tracks was barely possible. Apparently, the claws were the hardest part of the Rock Thunderbird. Each of the captured players had a stunned face, their eyes filled with disbelief. They realized that the final field of the Tower of Trials was certainly very difficult, but they still didn't expect it to be this challenging. It's just an ordinary Rock Thunderbird, but it had the strength of a third-ranked monster. Put into front of them, it was a boss presence of the finals, and it was a glitch.

If that Rock Thunderbird King were no more than a fourth or fifth rank, you'd say it's not too outrageous, but that's not the case here. The blue stars Tower of Trials was said to have been modeled after The Reincarnation Tower, with a difficulty level lower than that of The Reincarnation Tower, but this was only the fifth floor of the Tower of Trials. It was this challenging. What about the sixth and seventh floors behind it, and what about the eighth floor, the ninth floor? That's unimaginable. The Tower of Reincarnation is going to be harder than the Tower of Trials, after all.

These players realized this one by one, and they resigned themselves to their fate helplessly, closing their eyes and giving up their struggle. Some players even chose to abstain on the spot, directly withdrawing from the final battlefield. At this moment, the Rock Thunderbird swooped down, causing further reductions on the list. Since there weren't many Rock Thunderbirds, most players escaped as a result. Of course, there were also players who, using their own strength, directly decimated the swooping Rock Thunderbirds. Luu, for example, the moment he dodged that claw, simply raised his hand and sliced off the rock Thunderbird's head with a single stroke of his sword. The strength of that rock Thunderbird was nothing more than an ordinary third stage, which was tricky for others but not a problem for Luu.

As the Rock Thunderbirds finished catching the wave of people, they disappeared into the clouds, seemingly returning to the top of the mountain. As for those players taken, be they dead or alive, it was still unknown. But it was clear that the odds were stacked against them. Here's what happened next,

Will those Rock Thunderbirds return after they've captured this group? The outcome is evident, and their reappearance is inevitable. The remaining players, not taking any risks, were acutely aware of one necessity; they had to amass enough points before the Rock Thunderbird's return. This way, even if they perished at that moment, they could still secure a respectable ranking. From there, they would be able to obtain a ticket to The Reincarnation Tower. What follows could be quite tragic.

Suddenly, Luu sensed something and raised his eyebrows. At that very moment, a 3-meter tall giant descended from the sky like a meteorite, striking the ground with a resounding crash. Complex inscriptions could be faintly discerned on its body, and its skin, covering its entire form, was akin to steel, glowing with a metallic luster. It was unmistakably a Dharma body Powerhouse. He looked up at Luu, who was not far away, and grinned wildly, his voice brimming with excitement as he spoke, "I Found You, Luu, the Marshall Saint's only son!"

Luu responded with some surprise, "It's you, Luu."

Before the finals began, Luu had seen a list detailing the players expected to win the championship. The total number of people was about ten, all top-notch experts. It was said that some people were there specifically for him, just to gauge how much he, the son of the Marshall Saint, truly weighed. For example, this was the case with the strong man in front of him, who was more than 3 meters tall. His name was Jang Donga. He was once at the pinnacle of the fifth realm, just one step away from breaking through the sixth realm to become a patriarch. It was said that even the Dharma phase was on the verge of congealing. However, he chose to retrace his path of cultivation, which was quite surprising.

Jong Donga looked at Luu and asked with some surprise, "You know me?" Luu nodded, "Of course, I know you. You are at the peak of the fifth realm, fully condensing your Dharma body and already mastering a portion of the Dharma phase. I didn't expect that even you have retraced your cultivation path."

Scared, Jong Donga stared at Luu and said with a smile, "That's right, I did. I bullied the small with the big. However, you are the son of a Marshall Saint after all. So, let me test your accomplishments and see how much you weigh. Although this is an unfair battle, you have to understand that there is no fairness in this universe in the first place. If you can't even get past me, how can you defeat the outer race Geniuses? If you're afraid of this, I advise you to never go to The Reincarnation Tower to disgrace yourself and discredit Lord Marshall Saint." Speaking of this, Jang Dong gazai carried some fervor in them, and it was clear that he was an admirer of the Marshall Saint.

Luu didn't get angry when he heard these words. He looked up at this big guy and said with a smile, "You know what I've heard a very accurate comment about you fifth realm heavy cultivators?" Jong Donga subconsciously asked, "What other comment is there on this bullying, bullying unfair competition?" The evaluation is straightforward. "You fifth realm heavy cultivators are nothing but a bunch of trash," Luu said seriously.

Hearing these words, Jung Donga first froze, his face instantly becoming a bit odd as he narrowed his eyes and looked at Luu. "What did you say?" Luu laughed and continued, "If you guys weren't wastes, then you wouldn't have chosen to destroy the Foundation. Wouldn't you just wait for the opening of the five Realms reincarnation Tower? To put it bluntly, it's still a lack of self-confidence that makes you want to focus on the path of cultivation. And you still want to dominate with that little insignificant Advantage. A truly strong person would choose to destroy their foundation and recultivate. So, you're just a bunch of losers. Facing a punk like you and actually thinking I'd be afraid? Haha, you're quite the Joker."

Jung Donga had wanted to tease Luu, but he didn't want to. Instead, every word was a heartbreaker. As the saying goes, a lie never hurts the truth is the quick sword. If one truly had an invincible heart, who would choose to retrace the path of cultivation? Listen to these words. Jung Dong's eyes widened, and his brain buzzed. He wanted to retort, but he didn't know how or where to retort. This comment was a top-down comment, mostly from the mouth of a powerful person, and associating it with Luu's identity could it be said in this instant. His metallic-colored skin, which was already like steel, was actually starting to turn red with warmth. Ah, Dash Jong donga was furious and stumped the ground violently, causing the Earth to crack as he pointed at Luu and said angrily, "Originally, I wanted to be merciful, but now you've angered me."

In the meantime, the invisible live camera in the sky broadcast the scene in its entirety. The group of guides who could be said to have been paying attention to Luu the entire time immediately gave the camera a shot. After seeing him decapitate The Rock Thunderbird's head at the moment, someone runs over to challenge it. Much less miss this heavy hitter, a powerful man of the Dharma body fighting the only son of the Marshall Saint. The host's voice was impassioned after killing.

The rock Thunderbird, Luu, encountered his first formidable adversary, the points leader of Battle Zone 17, the Dharma body Powerhouse, Jung Donga. The seated player was expected to win the championship and came straight at Luu without any hesitation. At this moment, the camera focused on Jong Donga. His tall stature, steel-colored skin, perfectly proportioned muscles, and tattered Dharma inscriptions all attested to his toughness. When he appeared on stage, he was like a meteorite falling to the ground, making all the spectators' hearts tremble. Although the realm was a realm, the strength, however, was not a realm.

Subsequently, the conversation between the two was also a battle of wits. In Jang Donga's words, "If this is fear, then do not go to The Reincarnation Tower to disgrace." This angered many people, but they did not know how to refute him. After all, Jung-dong Pavilion was indeed very strong, even Jiang Banga couldn't help but speak up, "Cousin Donga is also too overbearing. Why did he specifically come over to target brother Luu?" The beautiful woman on the side smiled and said, "But there is some truth in what he said, which makes sense."

Jang Banga bristled on the other side, and the little fat Pier Ch Yun couldn't help but clench his fists when he saw the scene. Jang Dong was strong, a powerful son of a powerful man who was one round older than them. This kind of strength oppression was truly astonishing. But isn't that bullying a child? It's so unfair.

When Bayu Ya saw this scene, she couldn't help but furrow her brows and said with some dissatisfaction, "This young family brat, why is he even engaging in targeting Lu Chang Shing?" Lu Chong Shong didn't care either. "The Tower of Trials is meant to kill each other. It's normal to have targeting." Just then, Luu spoke. The question he threw out was not only curious to Jang Donga but even the countless viewers in front of the screen were also a bit curious. "An accurate assessment, what's that?"

Soon after, Luu gave his answer. Waste Jang Banga froze, little fat Pin Yi froze, even Bayu Ya froze. Almost all of the audience froze. No one expected that Luu would give such a comment. Next, Luu even gave an explanation in an unflinching tone. Along with each of Luu's words, JN Dong's expression changed. When Luu finished speaking, his entire body was furious, and the red temperature was visible to the naked eye. All the audience couldn't help but laugh out loud at the scene.

Haha, he was in a hurry. When Bayu Ya saw this scene, she couldn't help but smile and say, "This little mouth laboring, he's really good at talking. Just a few words and he's pissed off Jong Donga like this." Lu Chong Shong, who was on the side, was stunned when he heard these words. He saw the shadow of Xiaan Yuan. Was he the one who taught Luu like this? How damaging.

Chapter 84: Arguing with a small child like Luu, it was really a shame to win the argument, and even more shame to lose it. At this moment, Jang Donga had already regretted why he had to say so much nonsense. He violently stepped on the ground, and his entire body was like a cannonball, directly pressing over. Then, he raised his thick arm and smashed it. This smash was like a Heavenly fall. Luu's reaction was quick, and he violently retreated while swinging his sword. Red Dust sword technique, kill under the light of the sword. JN Donga, who was in a state of rage, had already lost his mind and spirit. At this moment, he was even in a trance, as if he could see the Marshall St. L changing, looking at him in disappointment.

"What a waste. You're already at the peak of the fifth realm, yet you don't have the slightest bit of self-confidence, and you've actually chosen to retrace your path of cultivation. The path of a martial artist never goes backward. Why are you going backwards?" When Jan Donga heard this, he was so ashamed that he couldn't wait to kill himself immediately. I, I suddenly he reacted and instantly saw through the illusion, which made him see the sword light in front of him coming straight towards his neck. What an insidious sword move, almost got hit.

Jang Donga raised his hand violently, and the sword light collided into his arm. At first, there was a crisp sound, followed by an unpleasant sound of Zera. Under this sword, a bone-deep gash appeared on Jang Dong's arm. If he is chopped to the neck, he is eliminated. What a powerful sword. It can actually pierce my mind. Jong Donga laughed instead of being angry. His arm muscles continued to wriggle and quickly stop the flow of blood. Immediately afterward, the tattered inscriptions on his huge body blossomed with a shimmering light, and his entire Aura went to the next level. Luu could clearly feel that those tattered inscriptions were continuously strengthening his physical body. Next, his speed will soar, and his attacks will be stronger.

Boom! Jung Donga slammed on the ground and directly disappeared in place. Luu raised his head. Only Jang Donga appeared in mid-air like the rock Thunderbird from earlier and swooped towards Luu. It was an attack from the sky. Luu's face became grave in the face of D Jang Dong's attack. He did not retreat, let alone flee, but slowly raised the sword in his hand. The sword was like an abyss. The sword intent surged wildly, and the sword Chi was rampant, very different from the luminescent sword light.

This sword, personally passed down by Sword Emperor Xia Wanan, was named Extreme Demon Punisher. It was meant to suppress evil with evil, to punish the devil with the devil. It was more evil than evil, more devilish than the devil. Before the sword was even unsheathed, Jang Donga had sensed its treachery. He felt a chill run down his spine, but it was too late to turn back.

His eyes were glued to Luu's sword as he shouted, "Kill!" He couldn't believe it. He, a peak fifth realm heavy cultivator, was unable to defeat this little doll. The moment he charged down, Luu swung the sword backward, releasing countless sword lights that cut into Jang Donga's body like a raging storm.

Arms were slashed, thighs were pierced, chests were sliced open. In an instant, Jang Donga was almost unrecognizable, drenched in his own blood. However, his physical body defense was extremely strong, and with the help of the Dharma body inscription, he was able to resist the Extreme Demon Punisher.

Luu was not surprised. His own Extreme Demon Punishment was not yet perfect, lacking in power. He had planned to kill Jang Donga with the Wild Storm of Sword Light, but Jang Donga's strike was faster than he had anticipated. Luu quickly retreated, dodging the attack.

The ground shook as a huge pit was smashed open, debris flying everywhere. Jang Donga stared in disbelief, his eyes wide open. "You're a sword martial artist. If you fail in a single strike, you'll disappear a thousand miles away. You think I'm like you, a reckless barbarian?" Luu said in disbelief.

Despite his young age, Luu had the power of the natural dragon and tiger, but he couldn't fully play it out against these muscular barbarians. Jang Donga was speechless, his body covered in blood, unable to control his muscles to completely block the attack. The sure-fire strike was dodged by Luu at an extremely fast speed, making Jang Donga's heart sink. Could it be that he was going to lose to this little doll?

Before the match, Jang Donga had boasted to his friends, "I heard that he's extremely talented, more than a demon. Let me try him out and see what he's made of. Let's see if he's as heaven-defying as the rumors say." But now, as he saw the crowd approaching, he regretted his words.

Several peak fifth realm heavy cultivators had come to snipe Luu, including Jing Xi, Shia Jein, Zongi Wu Hong, and Jun Siai. They were all champions and seeds, but in their eyes, the champion of the Tower of Trials and the rankings were nothing. Their sole purpose was to test the depths of Luu, the Marshall Saint's only son.

When they saw Jang Donga's wretched appearance, they were surprised and couldn't help but taunt him. "Brother Donga, do you want some help? Why are you in such a sorry state? Could it be that you're going to lose? Didn't you say it's good to bully children? How come you're being bullied by a kid?"

Jang Donga's face turned even uglier as he heard their taunts. He opened his mouth to speak, but Luu, who was not far away, spoke first. Luu looked at them with concern and waved his hand, saying, "Don't make noise and don't make trouble. First come, first served. Line up one by one. Of course, if you can't wait, you can all go together."

The faces of these few people were quite wonderful. They hadn't really thought that Luu would be even wilder than them, asking them to come together. But although Luu said so, they still had some self-respect. It was originally a big bully bullying the weak, and how could it be good to go together? If they did go together, it would really disgrace their families.

Luu saw that they had no intention of going together, so he stopped talking nonsense and raised his hand to strike.

The sword pull unveiled Luman's sword, light as a breeze, as it sliced through its path. Jong Donga, lacking significant battle spirit, struggled to resist the formidable foe after being struck by the sword. His massive body slowly crumbled. Witnessing the sword's power firsthand, the remaining few individuals' pupils dilated, as none had anticipated Luu's advancements and mastery of the sword.

Luu, however, raised his long sword and bellowed, signaling the start of the next chapter (85). The battle between Jan Donga and Luu could be described as exhilarating, with extreme power on one side and a sharp sword on the other. Yet, Luu emerged as the superior fighter, bringing Jiangdong down to size. If Jiangdong were still at the peak of the fifth realm, Luu's swords wouldn't have even dented his defense, let alone killed him. However, Luu had destroyed his golden body and retraced his cultivation path, placing him at the peak of the first realm. As a result, both his attack and defense had significantly decreased, which is why Luu needed only three swords to kill him.

These three swords, however, were not ordinary. Each was a killing move, draining almost half of Luu's chi after three consecutive strikes. It must be said that Jiangdong Pavilion was indeed a formidable opponent. A peak fifth realm heavy cultivation was truly extraordinary. Facing such a strong adversary head-on allows one to discover their own shortcomings. Luu vaguely understood the true purpose of his Master allowing him to participate in the Tower of Trials. Bitter cultivation, even with high talent and fast progress, is like a castle on the sand, appearing bright and shiny but easily shattered by the waves. The only way to apply learned knowledge in actual combat is by continuously fighting strong opponents.

Luu held his breath, adjusted his breathing rate using a breathing method to recover quickly. He also planned to fight in the next battle while maintaining the breathing method. It was challenging, but it was a lifetime away if one didn't try. Luu's eyes blazed with battle spirit, and his face looked at the distant few individuals with anticipation. The men were momentarily confused, as were the countless viewers in front of the screen.

Riverside Snow applauded excitedly, while the beautiful woman beside her was stunned, almost dropping her jaw in shock. Jiangdong was the top seedling of their Jung family, excelling in both strength and talent. This time, as he retraced his cultivation path, his goal was clear: to break into the top VI of the one realm reincarnation Tower and obtain a supreme treasure. Who would have thought that he would fall into Luu's hands? This was too much for a three-year-old. She called him the demon of all demons. The beautiful woman was incredulous until she heard the next sentence.

Jiang Banua then reacted, hastily dialing Jiang Donga to communicate. Comforting her cousin, Donga, she sighed, realizing that Jiang Donga surprisingly lost just like that. The beautiful woman couldn't help but sigh. Meanwhile, Jiang Donga, who had exited the virtual reality Warehouse, was confused. He had been confident in breaking into the Reincarnation Tower but lost to a young child. He accepted a communication call from Jiang Banua, freezing at the sight of it.

Jiang Banua asked if everything was alright, and Jiang Donga responded, "Don't be discouraged, little one." Jiang Banua's watery voice came through, comforting Jiang Donga's heart. Even his young cousin Jiang Banua had come to console him. He needed to pull himself together. As he was thinking this, Jiang Banua continued, "Brother Luu is so powerful. It's normal that you can't beat him. It's not that you're too weak; it's that he's too strong. In the end, don't get too discouraged. Keep up the good work."

Jiang Donga, from the Jiangdong Pavilion, was infuriated and anxious, unable to retort because Luu truly was stronger. He questioned, "What do you mean it's normal that I can't beat him? He's just a three-year-old kid who's only been practicing for a month. Isn't losing to him embarrassing enough, and I should still be at peace with it?" Jiang Banua remained calm, and Jiang Donga ended the call, feeling frustrated. Jiang Banua then looked at her mother and triumphantly stated, "I comforted my cousin. He should feel much better now."

When the beautiful woman heard this, she was speechless for a moment. It was like adding insult to injury, rubbing salt in the wound, and doubling down on the storm. Schwear was so sweet, but in the end, the beautiful woman still said so. She looked up at the TV again, and at that moment, the second battle had already been fought on the virtual Battlefield in the Northern Wasteland.
When those few heard Luu's words, they all understood that this kid was using them as a sword-sharpening stone. After a short silence, the man at the head slowly walked out. Luu looked over and immediately recognized this person - Zoni Wu of the Zong family. This was an Ecto martial artist, a combination of ecto and martial artist. There were many tactics that could be used in a variety of ways, and they were defensible, even if one retakes the road of cultivation. All kinds of supernatural means had long been greatly discounted, not as good as before, but also not to be underestimated.
At this moment, Zoni Wu looked at Luu and spoke, "I originally didn't approve of them bullying children, but since you're so strong, so strong that you defeated Jang Donga, then this isn't bullying children." Saying so, Zongi Wu cupped his fists in a martial salute and said, "Seriously, in my Zong family, Zongi Wu, please teach me more."
When his opponent was so polite, Luu you also opposed a sword salute, please also teach me. I will not show any mercy." Zonu raised his head and said earnestly, "Please also be careful in dealing with it and don't ever blame me for bullying the small with the big."
Cut the crap, come battle! Luu you raised the sword in his hand. Yes, Zi Wu immediately pressed in, and the moment he raised his hand, it was a killing move - soul-shattering psychic Nimble attack. After retracing the path of cultivation, Zone Yu's physical body strength, as well as supernatural attacks, although it had long been much worse than before, this move had never missed, especially against these first realm martial artists. It could be said to be a 100 tries complete numerical crushing.
As expected, at this instant, Luu's eyes revealed a blank expression, and he directly stayed in place. It's over. When the other few people in the back saw this scene, they couldn't help but laugh and say, "Saying that he doesn't want to bully children, but it turns out that he's the best at bullying them. Yeah, using a spiritual thought attack on a 3-year-old, it's really him. That's the end of it. I still want to try his sword. Just how sharp it is."
While several people were chatting like this, Zongi Wu, who had gotten close with the intention of ending the fight, was suddenly beheaded by Luu with a backhanded sword. As the head spun in the sky, Zoni Wu's face was filled with dismay. "Why? Why didn't his soul-shocking spiritual thought aspect of the attack have the slightest effect? Luu is only a first realm martial artist, his age is only 3 years old, and he has only been practicing for a month. How much martial will could he condense to be completely immune to this move?"
But Fong's eyes were blank, and he was actually just tricking and pretending to be tricked. What's going on with endless confusion? Zoni Wu was eliminated as his head fell to the ground. Luu raised his head again and shouted in a clear voice, "Again next!" It was like a death wish, and there was silence all around. Everyone was silent, whether it was the distant spectators or the several powerful people lined up close by. They all looked at Luu in shock.
Not that's it. Chapter 86: Battle Cool as a Foreign Martial Artist. Zongi Wu might not be the strongest one among them, but he was definitely the one with the most means and the toughest to fight. In addition to spiritual attacks, he also had a variety of minor psychic abilities that acted as AIDS, which, when combined with his own martial arts, could be considered as a defense. However, it was such a character that was beheaded in just one round, which was really hard for them to accept.
Thinking back to a short while ago when they had agreed to come over together for a fish fry to see what this son of the Marshall Saint had become, to see if he was as Heaven-defying as the rumors had it, the mentality at that time could be described as lofty. It turned out that the fish didn't get fried but got fried by the fish instead. How long has it been? Jang Donga was eliminated. Zoni Wu was also eliminated just now. Zoni Wu's mental power attack did work, but why was Luu able to instantly storm back, or is it that it didn't work in the first place?
The former showed that Luu's reaction speed, as well as his instantaneous burst of strength, had completely crushed them. In order to easily eliminate Zoni Wu, the latter was an indication that Luu's mental strength, as well as his martial will, was even stronger than those of them who had been practicing hard for 10 or 20 years. Both the former and the latter are outrageous and very unreasonable. It makes them a little skeptical, but only Luu himself knew better.
Things are not that way. Zoni Wu's mental power attack was indeed powerful, but it had little effect on Luu. Firstly, the appearance of the red dust sword heart had significantly increased the strength of his spiritual power by more than half a point. Secondly, in the depths of his Sea of Consciousness, in the place of his innate Divine Soul, there was a Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul suppressor.

Stone sat here protecting the Sea of Consciousness and divine Soul, ensuring he was not threatened by spirit-based attacks. Zoni Wu's mental power attack was like a gentle breeze, with no discernible damage. Luu knew this was his opportunity, so he feigned being hit and, at the critical moment, backhanded Zoni Wu with a sword, chopping him down. As a sword martial artist, his advantage was clear: he was extremely fast, making close-range attacks nearly impossible to counter. When Jang Donga and Zoni Wu were eliminated one after another, these people were stunned, unable to accept that they, at the peak of the Fifth Realm after retracing their cultivation path, were defeated by a first realm puppet. This was a devastating blow to their martial arts hearts. However, Ludu called again, and the result was even more humiliating. Not engaging was worse than losing, and not even considering it was even more embarrassing. They were in a dilemma. At this moment, their hearts were already regretful. Why had they come, only to find nothing to do? They had thought of trying Luu's success, but they had become someone else's sword-sharpening stone. After a long time, one person emerged. When Luu saw this man, he immediately recognized him: Jing Xi, the Jing Family's Rising Super Genius, who had mastered a portion of the Dharma phase in the Fifth Realm, making his strength almost unfathomable. Even after retracing his cultivation path and losing most of his strength, he was still formidable. However, his calm demeanor after beheading two people showed his confidence. The stronger the enemy, the better the opportunity to sharpen oneself. At this moment, many people had gathered nearby, drawn by the battle. The virtual battlefield was a wilderness surrounded by endless land, with only distant mountains obstructing the view. The battle was so loud that it naturally attracted many people. When they gathered, they were surprised to find that this was actually a fight between the champion seated players. After observing the battle for a while, they were even more shocked to see that this group of champion seeds was actually fighting Luu in a wheel battle without any marshal virtues. It was so targeted that it was not obvious, but Luu was not afraid and became more courageous. Two had already fallen to his sword, and there would be a third, a fourth, and even a fifth. He was like the mythical Great God of the Three Altars of the Sea, Neza, the third prince, who was young but powerful. Who was he up against now? Jing Xi, the genius of the Jing Family, was actually being pressed by him. This battle left all the onlookers in awe. When Xuang saw this scene, his face was subtle, and his heart was shaken. He had joined the Tower of Trials to fight Luu, hoping to see if this leading brother was as powerful as rumored. Originally, Xuang was still very confident, having suppressed his realm for three years and polished it to Great Perfection. However, after seeing the battle with his own eyes, Xuang could not remain calm. He felt that he had no rivals in the first realm, but the question was, was this really a battle between first realm martial artists? It was not an exaggeration to say it was a battle between third and fourth realm martial artists. Xuang could clearly feel the gap between himself and them. If he really got involved, he might be defeated in an instant. Xuang looked at Luu in the distance, his heart filled with admiration for the only son of the heroes of Dashia, the Eternal Big Brother. The strength was breathtaking. The son of the Sage of Martial Arts, his name was true. Not only Xuang but also the others who came to watch the battle had similar thoughts. When this live broadcast caused even more of a stir, Luu's demonic level once again refreshed everyone's impression. As this fierce battle continued, Luu finally defeated Jing Xi, exhausting his chi. By this time, even with the breathing method, he could not replenish his strength quickly. He leaned on his sword, breathing heavily, sweat dripping from the back of his head, almost wetting his back. Another person emerged, looking at Luu and asking, "Can we come back now?" He wanted Luu to know what to do and give him a step to admit defeat and end the fight. However, Luu's eyes were bright, but he was not

The least bit afraid, he spoke again, refusing to admit defeat, begging for mercy. That wasn't his style. Even if they fought until they were exhausted and until they died, it was impossible to admit defeat. Good Xia Jee nodded and walked straight over. The situation had gotten to the point where this was already an unfair fight. Both the viewers in front of the TV and the audience in the live broadcast room felt heartbroken when they saw the scene. Many people were even filled with righteous indignation. "These people are really shameless! They don't even give him a chance to breathe. Are you really that afraid of losing? You want to wear him out by wheeling him like this?"

Jiang Bangu said angrily, "This is so unfair! The rules don't restrict such behavior."

The beautiful woman touched the little girl's head and said helplessly, "Though she also felt it was a little less than nice to be explicitly targeted like that, the rules were such that there was nothing you could say about it. Rules are rules, but they're still going too far like this."

Jiang Bangu frowned and spoke with great irritation. "It's really just a wheel war. Are these several families of boys not going a little too far?"

Bayu Ya frowned and said with some displeasure, "They are actually clearly targeting Luu. Don't you care?"

Saying so, Bayu Ya glanced at Lu Chang Chun. "No harm done." Lu Chang Shang saw the scene but his expression remained calm as he touched Bayu Ya's hand to calm her down a bit.

"A precious sword is sharpened from its edge," Lu Chang Shang said. "The only reason why they are targeting like this is because they are feeling the pressure and are afraid that they will lose too badly if Luu is given enough rest time and really eliminates them one by one. If Luu were to be eliminated, it would be a disgrace for him. This battle, even if he loses, is an honored one. Despite his defeat, it doesn't affect anything. No one will despise him for it. It's just a failure. Who hasn't failed? Even I have failed. There's no need to take it too seriously. It's just childish banter."

Bayu Ya heard these words but frowned and continued, "I see. Ah, it is you are too good to talk. Those talents don't take you as a matter of fact. This is all bullying Luu to the head."

Compared to Lu Chang Ching's rationality, Bayu Ya was a bit more emotional. No matter who he was bullying, Luu's head would not work. She just had to protect her calf.

When Li Chang Xang heard this, he didn't try to persuade him any further. Although his character was good, he wasn't a close or distant person. If Bayu Ya really wanted to target him, he wouldn't forcefully stop it.

"Big Brother!" The little chubby Pi Chai's eyes turned a little red when he saw the scene. He pointed at the TV and couldn't help but curse, "How can they target Big Brother like this?"

After speaking, he immediately went to the Heroes of the Great Summer group and condemned with righteous indignation. At this moment, there were quite a few others who had the same idea as him. The group was cursing at the moment. "These people really don't even have a face. That's it! I'm going to smash the glass in their house tonight! I'm going to pinch Mama! Even if the peak of the fifth realm retraced the path of cultivation, that's already enough bullying, and now they're even coming in wheel to combat these guys are simply being inhuman. That's right, that's right! They must be taught a lesson. Then again, there should be relatives of these guys in the group, right?"

Yes, this Great Summer Heroes chat group almost covered most of the powerful and Noble Sons and Daughters of Blue Star as well as many Supreme geniuses. So it could be said that it was full of talents and there were all kinds of people. These include relatives of Jang Donga, Jing XI Xiao, Jin Zongi, Wu Hong, Xiao Jun, and Saai. It was only after a series of ads from the group that these people were embarrassed to come forward. They immediately swore that when Jang Donga, Jing XI Xiao, Jin, and the others returned home, they would secretly put laxatives in their meals, let them poop from night to morning. This plan was immediately unanimously approved by all.

Little chubby Pi Chai, Yumi saw this message and was instantly delighted, feeling very appropriate. "Let them have such bad hearts and actually dare to target Big Brother. If we don't teach them a lesson, we really don't put our Great SE heroes in our eyes anymore!"

Shyong watched his son angry and stupidly happy, couldn't help but some curiosity. "In the end, what happened?"

Just then, a sudden change occurred. Shyong raised his head somewhat unexpectedly and looked at the TV. The moment the virtual Battlefield Northern Wasteland, just as Xiao Jin walked over, a voice suddenly appeared, "Wait!"

The people present heard this and all froze, subconsciously turning their heads to look over. The person who made the sound just now was clearly Chu Young. He ran over with big strides and crossed in front of Luu and Xiao Jin.

"Chu Young, what are you doing here?" Xiao Jin looked at Chuang and asked in a somewhat strange manner. Not to mention Xiao Jin, even Luu was surprised.

"Shuang, what am I here for?" When Chuang heard this, he smiled and said, "Is it that you guys are allowed to battle my big brother in a wheel, but I'm not allowed to make a move? If you want to defeat my..."

Big Brother stepped over my corpse. At this first hearing, Shia jeene snorted, "It's not that I don't give you face. You're not my opponent, of course." I knew Chu yangang didn't object; he just looked straight at Xioajin and continued to ask, "But so what's the good in that? I'll settle you first." 

Xiao jeene nodded indifferently. "Wait. At this moment, someone else ran over from the surrounding crowd watching the battle. It was certainly Xioajin. Add me, Xioajin said seriously. Originally, I had average strength and was afraid of coming over to help, but if it's just a matter of dragging out time, I can still do it. I'm in, big brother. I'll help you with the situation."

As it was, one after another, many more people ran over and crossed in front of Xiojen and Lü. They knew very well that if they didn't come forward at this time, they wouldn't be able to go back to the Great Summer Heroes group in the future. I'm afraid that being criticized as a coward and a scaredy-cat will be a common occurrence.

At this moment, people were coming one after another, and there were already 30 or 40 people. When the number was so large, the crowd was still working together, even if their strength was average, they shouldn't be underestimated. Shia Jin's expression, from the initial calmness, gradually turned into gravity. No matter how powerful he was, he was still a realm of one, and it was difficult to solve everyone in an instant. Moreover, the purpose of these people was clear: not to defeat him, but to stall Lü for time. When Lü recovered, it would be his time to die.

Lü looked at these people in surprise. Just then, the system appeared with a mission alert:

"Stage Four Mission. 100 Companions Recognized. Current Progress: 121 out of 100. Phase Four of the Mission Has Been Successfully Completed. Acquired the Ultimate Heaven and Earth Wonder: Tai'yu Immortal Cells."

Lü's eyes lit up with joy. He hadn't really expected that the mission would suddenly be completed at this time. Since this mission was completed, the ranking of this Tower of Trials, as well as the results, would not matter at all. Lü didn't bother to look at the specific effects of this Absolute Heaven and Earth Wonder. Anyway, it was already a done deal. It simply couldn't be any more unchangeable.

"A Wheel to—Ha! You think I'm too weak?" Lü raised his head and said loudly, "All of you, listen to my orders! Follow me into battle!"

At these words, 30 to 40 people responded in unison, "Yes!"

"What does it mean to be a human leader?" 30 to 40 people spoke in unison, chanting at the same time, and the momentum could be described as overwhelming. Even a strong person like Shia Jin's face was a bit ugly at the moment. He hadn't really expected Lü to be so unmartial to come straight to a group beating. But since they were the ones who didn't speak of martial virtues in the first place, and wheeled around Lü, they had nothing to say.

"At this moment, it's good that it's just 30 or 40 people, and their strength is very average. A group of weaklings gathered together, even if they hugged each other, couldn't affect the big picture," Shia thought this and turned his head to look at the few people behind him. "Lü has backup, doesn't he?"

A few people saw this scene and, in unison, they all took a few steps forward. One of them said, "What this means couldn't be more blunt: since you're going to gang up on us, we'll go along for the ride."

There were only 30 or 40 people in the area, and this numerical advantage couldn't affect anything yet. Seeing the movements of the few people behind him, Shia Jin instantly came to feel confident, and he smiled and said, "You called out first. Don't blame me for calling out, but you can rest assured that there will never be a siege on you—not yet. We'll just settle these people, and I'll come and fight you one-on-one."

Lü saw the opposite side's movements and wasn't surprised when he heard this. With so many people on his side, the opposite side would surely attack as well. It was almost predictable, but he had intended to make a scene. "It's just 30 or 40 people; it's not enough to make a scene," Lü said, showing his teeth and smiling.

Turning his head to look at the group of people watching the battle not far away, he asked loudly, "Who else is willing to listen to my orders? May enter my command and join me in the battle!"

When these words came out, Shia Jin's heart thumped, giving birth to an unpleasant premonition. At the same time, when these words came out, the group of people watching the battle not far away froze for a moment, obviously not expecting Lü to greet them but there was no doubt about it they were all moved.

Lü was known as the Marshall Saint's only son, and they had all heard of his genius. They had thought that there was no way that they and Lü would ever cross paths, and no one expected Lü to greet them and join him among his team. It was then that someone shouted, "I will!"

The moment these words came out, the surrounding crowd as if woke up.

In a dream-fueled frenzy, I shouted out, "I'll do it! I'll join the team!" I hastily added my name to the list, and these people couldn't wait to move forward, fearing that if they were even a fraction of a second slower, Lou wouldn't want them there. There was no restriction on teaming up in the tournament; indeed, it was tacitly authorized. As long as you were powerful enough, you could easily assemble a team. However, for the average person, such a prospect was virtually impossible. After all, there were clear rules governing team formation. For every player who beat another, they earned half of the other players' points, with a guaranteed minimum of 10 points.

This led to a reality where no one wanted to be vulnerable to others, and the consequences of a backstabbing were unthinkable. Organizing a team proved to be a daunting task, as people's loyalties were divided. No one dared bet against another player, so everyone essentially went it alone. Yet, there were exceptions to this rule. For instance, Lu still radiated an aura of authority, his strength recognized by the crowd. This earned him a call to action, and he alone had the authority to quell the petty concerns of the crowd. In that moment, more and more people flocked to join him, soon surpassing 300, then 400, and finally 500 individuals. This collective strength was terrifying, even if the individual strength of each person was average.

What's more, the sheer number of people was intimidating. Even Lu, surrounded by this considerable power, felt his heart pounding from holding together such an army. Meanwhile, Shiao Jin's face contorted in disgust as he gazed upon the scene unfolding before him. As he watched several people emerge from behind Xiaoen, walking calmly toward the battlefield, his footstep ceased, and his body stiffened in alarm.

"What's going on here?!" he exclaimed. "Are you playing games...?!" Lu glanced at Shiao Jin with disdain. "You guys can team up, but I'm the only one who can do that?!" As I spoke, Shiao Jin's associates opened their mouths in dismay, unsure of how to respond. It was true - he had teamed up first. What now?

Shiao Jin and his group were outnumbered and outmatched by over 1,600 people. While they could still ignore the disparity in numbers and use the element of stealth to suppress them, the tables had turned, and it wouldn't matter; they were still only in the first realm. Their only hope now was that, in this unusual gathering, the heart wasn't genuinely one and the same, and their cooperation wouldn't be driven by a tacit understanding. There's always a chance that, like a scattering of sand, they might not be able to fully utilize their newfound collective strength.

As Lu stood before his assembled crowd, a satisfied smile spread across his face. He examined each and every one of them and pondered the meaning of being a leader of humanity. He looked back, mentally planning his next move. Just a short while ago, I'd learned from the Master's side how to conduct an effective legion command. I'd thought that at least, in a short period, the effectiveness of such a tactic wouldn't be noticeable. Now, however, I found myself realizing that this virtual battlefield was a unique opportunity to adapt and execute my strategies on a larger scale.

The Master's words echoed in my mind as I reveled in my newfound authority. This Tower of Trials had brought me to this moment, and I was determined to make the most of it. As I looked out at the people before me, a sense of pride swelled within me. Unbeknownst to everyone, it was also the starting point of my glorious rise to the top.

In an instant, the scene spilled out onto the TV screens, causing widespread astonishment. Behind the presenter, an auditor in front of the monitor was left aghast. He couldn't fathom that Lu had managed to gather such an enormous team in a single moment. Originally, he'd thought the scenario would unfold with three or four individuals facing off against 30-40, which wouldn't be too difficult to handle. Yet, Lu had turned the tables, amassing 500-600 people within the blink of an eye. These people weren't afraid of being swindled, nor were they troubled by potential betrayal. They sprinted ahead, unphased by the danger. It was then that the host, numb with shock, admitted, "The scene has undergone a monumental change."

These weren't ordinary circumstances. According to the rules, there was no cap on such teamwork, but Lu hadn't directly broken any rules by pulling off this coup. The anomaly was that the situation caught everyone off guard; no one had ever seen anything like it before. The hosts themselves were perplexed, to say the least, leaving both Hosts and Organizers aghast, unsure of what to do next or even if they should intervene.

In this final battle, with approximately 500 to 600 participants, it is important to note that no rule was explicitly stated to prevent such a large gathering. However, the so-called rules are often used to restrict the weak while the strong disregard them, considering them as mere guidelines.

Luu Marshall Saints, the only son of a powerful figure, is the ultimate rule in this context. Whoever dares to challenge him, whether physically or verbally, faces severe consequences.

The officials can only lament their bad luck in this situation, as they struggle to maintain order amidst the chaos. A high-level decision has been made to end this farce by granting Luu the qualification for reincarnation, thus bringing an end to this chaotic tournament.

However, for the next tournament, a restriction will be added to prevent any single team from participating. At the moment, this Northern Wilderness has become Luu's home turf, where he dominates with his exceptional skills.

The few individuals from Xia are no match for him, and they are quickly suppressed. The others are chased like frightened rabbits, whether they are a flock of Rock Thunderbirds or a team of opponents. This brutal final battlefield is being used by Luu as a leveling game.

By Yu Ya, an observer, watches this spectacle with widening eyes, shocked by Luu's invincibility. Lu Chang Chang, on the sidelines, can't help but laugh out loud, admiring Luu's talent and disregard for the rules.

Byu Ya glances at Lu Chang Chun, wondering if he wants to see Luu bullied. Lu Chang Chun responds rhetorically, denying any such intention. He reflects on his own past, when he was alone and had no support, contrasting it with Luu's current situation, where he has a powerful backer.

Jang Danga, a spectator, claps her hands in excitement, finding Luu's actions shameless. The beautiful woman next to her feels a bit amused, commenting on the double standards in play. While others have the numerical advantage, Luu uses his power to push across, making his dominance obvious.

However, Luu's ability to judge the situation is commendable. He pulls his team together at the right moment, preventing a surprise attack from the Rock Thunderbirds and allowing his team to continue their rampage across the country.

The beautiful woman can't help but smile, impressed by Luu's actions. The little fat pin Yi is even more excited, praising Luu for his brilliance. In the Dashia heroes chat group, the focus has shifted from verbal attacks on Shiao Jin to praises for Luu.

Jawanan, a spectator in a VIP box, is taken aback by Luu's actions, acknowledging that he doesn't follow the rules. However, he admires Luu's power and considers him worthy of being his son. In Jaa one yuan's opinion, Luu's death in a fierce battle and subsequent fall under the Wheel battle was still an honorable end, praised by countless viewers.

What surprises Xia wuan is Luu's determination to continue, assembling a team of 500 to 600 men. Applying the legion command techniques he had taught him, Luu dominates the battlefield, leaving no one to challenge him. It seems no one can stop this rising star.

In order to withstand Luu, they had to band together, but the question remained: who would take the lead, who would organize them, who would vouch for them, and who had the authority to do so? No one possessed that authority, even if they were compelled by circumstances to form an alliance. It was still just a disorganized group, always on the lookout for potential betrayals. How could they present a united front to the outside world, especially their opponents, who had mastered the art of Legion warfare? This led to a virtual battlefield devoid of any suspense.

Meanwhile, spectators from the Blue Star, as well as those from other countries, were left dumbfounded as they watched Luu lead a group of 500 to 600 people, pushing them all the way across and doing as he pleased. How had a promising Tower of Trials final turned into such chaos? The entire Northern Wasteland was in complete disarray. However, in a way, it was a testament to the fact that if the rules did not limit them, why should they adhere to them?

When Shia Jin's few people were eliminated, it was a disheartening experience. Things were going in the opposite direction from what they had anticipated. Initially, it was just a test of Luu's abilities and to see what he had become. No one had expected Luu to be so strong, causing them to roll over three times in a row. However, by this point, Luu had already exhausted his strength, and there was no longer any doubt about victory or defeat.

But who would have thought that someone would stand out and block Luu's path? After which, he even raised his arm and a group of people surged over. They played rogue, but Luu played rogue more than they did. The most outrageous thing was that Luu commanding these people to fight actually had the shadow of a legion combat in it. It wasn't just a disorganized group at all.

As time passed quickly, when the game was about to end, Luu got the first place without any doubt, with an absolute leading score. As for the 500 to 600 people who followed him, they were all at the top of the list. Obviously, there was an advantage to following a big team, even if you mixed it up, you could still get a decent score. One by one, they were all smiling with joy and could be quite satisfied with the result.

Even when the game was coming to an end, instead of breathing a sigh of relief, he was a little saddened that there would be no such opportunity in the future and he could not follow Luu to continue his conquest. Luu looked at the group of people and also saw the reluctance in their eyes. He stood on a big rock, raised the sword in his hand, and said loudly, "Gentlemen, you are all geniuses of the human race, the future hope of our human race. This battle is just a small trial. In the future, there are many more opportunities waiting for us. At that time, we will fight together again and raise the might of our human race. The future fights again."

Saying so, Luu raised the long sword in his hand, which could be described as heroic. Although his voice was clear and childish, none of the people present underestimated him. They all listened in, and at that moment, emotions were high, and some people's eyes were even a little red. In the next moment, everyone followed Luu, raising their weapons in their hands and responding in unison, "Fight again in the future."

When the camera recorded the scene and broadcast it, many viewers were left speechless for a while. No one expected that this group of people, based on their numbers, would be able to hold the group together and push horizontally, and towards the end, it was even able to sublimate a little bit. It was not just a case of numbering the few but a meaningful campaign for the future. The battle will continue. Nice guy, Luu. This little guy is surprisingly still a natural leader.

But there were also some uncommonly knowledgeable viewers who saw something coming. Luu is really commanding in it. He seems to have mastered the method of attacking the legion, commanding it with a sense of tension and ease, and transferring it like a man. In fact, if it wasn't for that, it wouldn't have made those 500 to 600 people convinced of Luu's command. It's just so much more alarming. Are you kidding me? A three-year-old Legion Commander, chapter 90, absolute Heaven and Earth wonders. The true Immortal cells.

When the final of the Tower of Trials ended, this dramatic final immediately caused countless people to discuss it. Before that, no one had expected that the final would deviate in a direction that no one had expected and that it would go wild and crooked all the way to the end. Logically speaking, after the trial finals had gotten into such a state, the officials must have come down to stop it, using a pair of big invisible hands to set things right. It's time to phase out and penalize to get everything back on track. Even if you had a marshal emperor standing behind you, you wouldn't show any mercy because of it.

But Luu's back was not a marshal emperor but the only marshal saint of the human race. The entire human community, a thousand living planets, and trillions of people were all being carried on someone's shoulders. Officials were so spineless, goaded into acquiescing to this farce that they were close to sliding to their knees at light speed.

To come with a wheel of war against Luu, you officials didn't even come down to stop it, instead acquiescing to the situation. The result of Luu's arms gathering the team, using their numerical advantage to fight back, requires your intervention. Do you mean my sword is not sharp enough? The officials had to back down when they were already not in a position of power. It's just that if this is the case and the farce is allowed to happen, then the NTIs will have a field day.

There were those who said that Luu was fooling around, taking a good trial selection and making it into a farce. Will he still be able to fool around like this in the Tower of Reincarnation? Absolutely not. Not in the first place, his name doesn't live up to its reputation. There were also those who condemned the officials for their inaction, going so far as to allow Luu to fool around just because he was the Marshall Saint's son. This is simply too much of a wimp, or the organizers. Some people even traced back to the root of the problem, saying that the few people who had joined forces to come over and fight Luu in a wheel-to-wheel battle were really too unreasonable. They were the ones who had caused all of this to happen.

With the official announcement that this final, regardless of the number of points all of them could obtain the qualification to break into the Tower of Reincarnation, the many voices of condemnation suddenly faded away. Subsequently, someone else broke the news about Luu's command, which was quite good and had the style of the Dashia military command. When this news came out, it immediately stole the show and caused a furor. All those who saw this news were stunned. What, the style of the Dashia military command? No kidding, he's only 3 years old. It's understandable that the talent is incomparable, and the battle process is outstanding. After all, he is the only son of the Marshall Saint, and his genes are too strong. But you're going to say he's mastered the means of legionary combat? This is really outrageous. That's not the way to blow it. What kind of three-year-old learns these things? But something horrible happened. It doesn't seem to be nonsensical. The wise men have found quite a bit of corroborating evidence for one thing. Luu's command did have an army style in it, and that was precisely why, in the face of the other teams, it was able to be as powerful, devastating, and easy to push across.

The second was Luu's Master Sword Emperor Xia Wuan, who was the former Supreme Marshall of Diaa. It seemed reasonable for a marshall Master to teach his disciples some military matters. No one would have thought that such fake news, which is outrageous at first glance, would turn out to be true. This instantly caused a frenzy of discussion among countless people and eating medicine in the meantime.

Luu, who had just finished the tournament, wanted to take a day off since he had already gotten the first place in the Tower of Trials and completed the task given by his master. It was normal to take a day off as a reward. He couldn't wait to throw a banquet now and then gather the good brothers of the Dashia herd to play music and dance together, have a good blowout and then listen to how they blew themselves up. Such a beautiful thing, just thinking about it makes me feel good.

However, Xiao Wan retorted mercilessly after hearing the request for rest. "You only took first place in the Tower of Trials by virtue of your numerical advantage and it doesn't carry much weight. Still want to rest? What a beautiful thought." Hearing this, Luu quit at that moment. What do you mean by no gold content? First is first. The officials didn't even say anything, but you're not happy about it. Master, you really want to rest? Xiao Wuan glanced at him and said, "Ah Luu, you can rest if you want to, so let's end this retreat here."

Hearing this, Luu was a bit dumbfounded, not realizing that when he wanted to rest, his master would just give up and quit. Although he was a bit reluctant, he still spoke, "Then I won't rest. Why don't you rest again?" Xia Wuan asked with a smile. The first place in the Tower of Trials is nothing at all. What I want to take is the first place in the Tower of Reincarnation, so I can't end my seclusion just yet. Luu said so, and he was still able to prioritize things. Hosting banquets, bragging, chatting, and enjoying a pleasant atmosphere was certainly comforting, but for the sake of the Reincarnation Tower, these could be put aside for the time being. After all, the difficulty of the main quest was put there. Luu didn't want to be unable to complete it himself and then stay up for a decade or so before he could finish it. That's more like it. Xia Wuan nodded slightly and said indifferently, "You only took first place in the blue star trial or with this tricky method. To be honest, the current you is not even the first of the human race. The universe is vast and boundless, with many civilized communities. There are countless Geniuses in demons with this amount of strength you have now. To get the first place in The Reincarnation Tower is just too far, too far away. I believe that you should have felt your flaws and some of your problems through this trial. If you start to slack off just because you have won, then you will never be able to reach the top."

After securing first place in the Tower of Trials, it's wiser not to attempt The Reincarnation Tower right away. It's not that the challenge is excessively difficult; it's just that there's limited time for every second to be fought for, with no room for pauses. Upon hearing this, Xiaan Yuan's speech could be considered lengthy. Luu nodded, refraining from arguing. Xiao Jing, who overheard, also remained silent and admired Luu's determination to follow his brother's footsteps, despite the difficulty.

Upon returning to the real world, Luu sighed, understanding from his master's tone that achieving first place in The Reincarnation Tower would be extremely challenging. He would need to work tirelessly without stopping for even a moment to have a glimmer of hope. It might still be an insurmountable task. Just then, Luu suddenly remembered something and checked the system panel.

Rewards for previously completed tasks were listed, including a rare Heaven and Earth treasure, the Tyu Immortal Cells. Luu almost forgot about this valuable item. The Taiu Immortal Cell, of rank ninth and excellent quality, could be worn. It would enhance the wearer's understanding and perception of the tower to a certain extent. This peculiar object originated since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, increasing the wearer's comprehension.

Luu's heart swelled with joy upon reading the item's description. It was undoubtedly a supreme treasure, even more valuable than the eighth-order treasure he had obtained earlier. Such a level of item was considered a treasure for martial Emperor-level powerhouses. The Tower of Reincarnation attracted all the universe's races, with countless Celestial Pride striving to break through and obtain the Supreme treasures. Luu hadn't even entered The Reincarnation Tower yet, but he had acquired a supreme treasure. He deserved this Heaven and Earth's most precious treasure after dedicating nearly a month to finding ways to complete the quest.

Luu carefully examined the item's detailed description and nodded thoughtfully. Upon wearing it, the item would increase the wearer's understanding of the tower, providing a simple yet powerful effect. This was crucial in the early stages of body forging, where comprehending the da wasn't necessary until the fifth realm's late stage. At this point, the golden body must be transformed into a Dharma body, requiring an understanding of the tower.

Luu realized that this treasure could compensate for his flaws to a certain extent, making enlightenment easier in the future. Although he wasn't an exceptional talent, he had practiced hard for decades before breaking through the fourth realm. This reward could be considered a lucky break for the future, but he couldn't use it immediately since he was still in the first realm, and the golden body hadn't been cast. However, he knew that this powerful Supreme treasure would be invaluable in the long run.

In order to obtain this supreme treasure, it seems a bit too much when you yourself dislike the fact that you can't use it for a while. Thinking this way, Luu couldn't help but shake his head in stoic contemplation. He glanced at the Great Summer Heroes chat group. At the moment, this group of sand sculptured groupies were discussing the banquet. In their opinion, Big Brother had taken the first place in the Tower of Trials. Such a big happy event, how could he not organize a banquet to celebrate it properly? Must have a party, singing and dancing.
Close up and hard to blow, a wave of Big Brother awe-blowing in online chat group is really nothing tangible, more like a comedian who only repeats himself. Seeing such a message, Luu couldn't help but send a "Hey" as soon as these words came out. Chuyang immediately scurried out and asked Big Brother, "Why are you sighing?"
After the trial Tower's intrusion, Shuang Toyu had been convinced. Whether it was strength or character, the Big Brother was an impeccable existence. Even the Legion Command would be a hand. Previously, Luu had often bragged about the grand Summer Marshall-in-Chief, all praising him for his military literacy and commanding ability, calling him a natural General. At that time, although Chu Yang did not refute, in his heart, he was disdainful and felt that Lu You was really too good at bragging.
Who knows that this time, the Tower of Trials let him see the original bold words, not bragging, but the truth. It was just that Lu You was really good at Legion combat command. Without a doubt, Xuang could be said to be so admired that even the last trace of arrogance had rubbed off. However, Shuang's question caused You Guan Chung, who was half a beat slower, to stare in disbelief.
"No, you are at least a Martial Emperor family. Your family has produced three Marshal Emperors in succession, and you are usually so proud that your nostrils are turned upwards and you look at people with your chin. But now, you are actually stealing the position of a dog's leg with me. You are also too shameless."
When he saw that someone picked up on it, Luu said in the group, "I saw your discussion about the banquet, but I'm sorry to tell you that there's no way the banquet can be held. This time, Yaning was one step ahead of the others and hurriedly asked Big Brother, "What happened? Why can't we hold the banquet anymore?"
Luu replied again, "As much as I'd like to throw a party and hang out with my brothers, there are more important things waiting for me. Ah, you Guan Chung immediately picked up Big Brother's words, "What is more important than a banquet with the brothers?"
Luu replied, "Go to The Reincarnation Tower and make a break for the human race. I need to continue my seclusion." Chu Yang finally grabbed the words and asked, "Big Brother, you are already the number one in Blue Star. It's not even an exaggeration to say that you're the leader of the human race. Do you still want to continue your seclusion?"
L You replied, "To be honest, this Blue Star number one of mine is nothing more than a trick to get I can't even call myself number one of the human race. I'm afraid I don't have much hope of getting a top ranking in The Reincarnation Tower. Therefore, I need to continue my seclusion."
The crowd in the group could stand in awe at these words. No one had expected Luu to work so hard after getting first place in the trial Tower. This is just awesome. One by one, they have been blowing rainbow farts down there. Yub Waning even said, "Big Brother, since Big Brother said so, I'll continue my seclusion as well."
Luu couldn't help but smile when he saw these messages. Meanwhile, Xiao Jing, who was not far away, saw this scene, but his face was somewhat subtle. Things don't seem to be like this. Ah, Big Brother wants to rest very much and wants to hold a banquet very much, but due to the pressure of Pops, he can only hold his breath. It turned out to be a different story when it came to the group. However, Xiao Jing naturally didn't dismantle Luu. If you do that, what's the difference between you and a snitching traitor? He, Xiao Jing, was not such a Villain.
At the same time, with the end of the Blue Star trial selection, Luu's fame quickly spread throughout the entire human race and then unsurprisingly to the 10,000 races of the universe as well. Chapter 92: The Prince of Man Despite the fact that the human race and the 10,000 races of the universe were at war, as the saying goes, there are no eternal friends or eternal enemies, only eternal interests. Under the pole of interests, there were actually some weak and small groups that befriended the human race, and some medium-sized groups. Groups that often traded with the human race even some powerful ethnic groups had many strong people who were desperate and secretly contacted the human groups just to obtain high benefits.
Inevitably, when these Fay were doing business with the human race, they heard about the latest hot news, the interesting story of Blue Star's Tower of Trials. Luu, the son of the Marshall Saint, fought a fierce battle against a group of Heroes. Because his opponent were too unorthodox to speak of Martial virtues and played a direct game of wheel Warfare, he became even more unorthodox. He directly raised his arm and gathered 5 to 600 people, directly crushing his opponents and crushing the entire battlefield.
When the Fay heard the news, they were surprised and asked, "That's a competition for selection to enter The Reincarnation Tower. Wouldn't it be unfair to let so many people participate?"
However, the Fay soon realized that Luu's actions were not meant to be fair. His goal was to win at all costs, and he had the power to do so. The Fay couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for Luu's determination and strength. They began to spread the news of Luu's victory throughout the universe, and soon, the Prince of Man became a legend among the 10,000 races.

Him fooling around like that doesn't matter if we don't do anything about it. The answer received was, "Who dares to care? He is the son of the Marshal Saint or the only Heir for so many years. The organizers don't want to die and dare to punish him." However, the organizers were also clear that if they didn't do anything, things would definitely get out of hand in the end. So, they waved their hands and made all over 10,000 participants qualified to go to the Wheel of Reincarnation Tower to break into the world. This is forced to hemorrhage money.

I heard that after the finals of the Tower of Trials, quite a few other participants were thankful for Luu's nonsense because they were of average strength and would have found it difficult to qualify to break into the Wheel of Reincarnation according to the original rules, which only allowed a thousand or so people. This elimination intensity can be imagined. Now, everyone is directly happy.

Fay was dumbfounded by the answer he heard. "That's okay. It definitely wouldn't have worked. Who made him the only son of the Marshal Saint? This is the Crown Prince of our human race." The human race in charge of the transaction said with emotion, "Being the son of a Marshal Saint at birth, this skill of casting is no one else's. It's really enviable."

When Dash heard this, he just nodded and didn't say anything more. The story quickly spread, but it was a completely different version. Often, if the same thing is reported selectively, you get a completely different version. This is the highest art of lying. Clearly, all the things that are said are true, but the conclusions are false. Those foreigners naturally don't want to listen to the Heavenly story of your Marshal Saint's only son, Luu, who at the age of three defeated each and every one of the five Realms of heavy cultivators. This is not to grow other people's aspirations and to destroy one's own prestige. There's no way such outrageous things can get around, much less help you make a name for yourself. So, they'd rather hear stories like this: the only son of the human Marshal Saint, Luu, who plays with the rules recklessly due to his honorable status. It was clear that he didn't need to participate in the trial selection but still cut in halfway and forced his way in. If he goes in and plays well, that's fine, but he was fooling around as soon as he came up, treating the Tower of Trials as if it was a place for him to play. Clearly, it was a one-on-one match, but he led 5 to 600 people on a rampage, stiffly trampling on the dignity of all the geniuses of all the races with his own strength. After the tournament, he also got the ranking of first in the Tower of Trials. Can this not be the first?

When the matter was about to become a big deal, after the tournament was over, they used more than 10,000 reincarnation tower slots and sent them out to the geniuses of the human race as if they were callers. These spineless human geniuses were actually grateful to him and even had to say thank you. Such a prince who did whatever he wanted, such a human race where everyone wanted to flatter him, was really degraded to the extreme. The story is still the same, but the person telling it is different, telling it from a different angle and exporting a little bit of their own opinion, making it a very different story. Such a story, however, was obviously more conducive to spreading. But it was only a matter of a few days before it spread among the 10,000 races of the universe. The story of the old man's hero and son is always so popular and enjoyable for everyone. Many of the foreign races lamented that the human Marshal Saint's worldly reputation would be ruined sooner or later in the hands of his son. Although this matter with more than 10,000 reincarnation tower slots ended perfectly, what about next time? What about countless times in the future? How many times do we have to wipe his ass before we stop? Before he really grows up, briefly, the human race has suffered a great deal with this prince. But from the perspective of the human race's opposing side, the appearance of such a living treasure over there was a joyous event. It can be a joy to watch. Without Luu's knowledge, he was already infamous by the time he was aware of the situation. It had already spread to all the races in the universe. At this point, there's no way to disprove the rumor or disinformation. Who wants to listen to you? Who will cooperate with you? These foreigners are mostly enemies of the human race and only want to see your black material. As for your clarification, it's impossible to spread the word. Actually, regarding Luu's infamy, it spread so quickly, throughout the 10,000 races of the universe in just a few days. If it was said that there weren't those alien powerhouses behind it as pushers, who would believe it? Clarification is not going to go anywhere, whether it is black or white. Only time will tell. When Luu personally went to break into the Reincarnation Tower, all the smears and black material were not broken. The only thing that was a bit

Unfortunately, this infamy did not count towards reputation value, making it impossible to complete the system's quests. However, this was understandable; the system's task was to guide him in deterring the 10,000 races from becoming a laughingstock among themselves. The most important thing at the moment was to cultivate and perfect himself before the ten days passed.

In a flash, ten days arrived. Luu sat cross-legged in the middle of the 10,000 Swords Pavilion. After a long time, he slowly opened his eyes. He felt the bottleneck, sensing himself reaching the upper limit. It was hard, hard, hard, but also extremely easy to go further. It was difficult to go further when you had already polished your current realm to perfection; it was easy to simply break through the current realm.

In the way of the sword in martial arts, there were also several small levels corresponding to the first, second, and third realms. For Luu, the threshold of stepping through the realm was nothing at all and could be crossed casually. However, his purpose was clearly not this. Once one reached the second realm, there was no way to participate in the trials of the first realm, the Reincarnation Tower. What was to be done?

With this question, Luu consulted his master, Xiao Jian. Hearing this, Jia Jian wasn't surprised and directly gave a solution. "Although you feel the bottleneck and have reached the upper limit, it's not that there aren't ways to go further. Now there are two ways: one is to continue along my path, comprehending the many sword strokes and furthering my mastery of them. The second is to realize the Dao, to try to master the law."

Luu listened attentively to his master's explanation and subconsciously said, "Going to Enlightenment to master the law? You mean..."

Jia Jian nodded and slowly said, "You should also know that after casting a golden body in the five realms, you need to condense Dharma into the golden body to form a Dharma body. There are quite a few Dharma body powerhouses that you have defeated in the Tower of Trials, and they have more or less broken inscriptions on their bodies. That is the materialization of the Dao and law. Even if it's broken, it can still bring them a lot of increase in power and is the backbone of their invincibility in the same realm. Ever since the fifth realm, whether it's the Dharma body, the Dharma phase, or the domain, as well as the rules of the eighth realm onwards, or even your old man's ten realms of proof, all of them need to travel with the Dao. These things are said to be too subtle because the levels of the lower realms are too low to have access to them yet, so naturally, they cannot empathize with them. Even if I were to say it directly or even impart it to you with my consciousness, you would still be unable to understand it, much less grasp the Dao and Dharma."

Hearing this, Luu couldn't help but ask, "Then what does master mean? What others teach won't work? This requires you to comprehend and master it yourself. However, this is really too difficult. You can't lay a good foundation, you can barely feel it, and it's hard even if you have a high level of Enlightenment."

Jia Jian shook his head and said helplessly, "What I'm talking about is just a theoretical direction. Just try it out. Never overcommit yourself. Your focus is still on my sword path. Follow my path and continue on. Although this path is equally difficult, it is at least easier than Enlightenment."

In fact, at this point, it was already 100 feet. There was no need to take the bull by the horns any further. A normal breakthrough would suffice. But if Luu wanted to break into the Reincarnation Tower and get the first of the 10,000 races, then he had to go further. Then he must take the bull by the horns.

Well, the True Immortal Cell that he had previously obtained came in handy at this time. With this supreme treasure, it became a little easier for Luu to perceive the Dao and law. Specifically, it amounted to ignoring an undeveloped physical foundation and providing a bridge that could be traveled.

Unlike what Luu had expected, he didn't have the ability to use this supreme treasure to frantically Enlighten the Dao directly without any disadvantage and travel by leaps and bounds in a single day. It was still equally difficult to realize the Dao and master the law. However, compared to before, when one could not feel it at all and could not go to Enlightenment, it was already a heaven and earth difference.

Luu began to work his way up. The whole day went by in a flash. During this whole day, Luu did not eat or drink, completely immersed in Enlightenment. At this moment, he finally understood why those masters, without moving, closed their doors for several years during which they did not eat or drink and devoted themselves to it. Enlightenment is this kind of feeling. Each minuscule improvement is extraordinarily soothing, as if the meaning of living has been proven. It's a feeling like no other. Luu was accidentally intoxicated.

Jia Jian, unable to help but furrow his brows somewhat dissatisfied with his behavior, said, "Remember, the path to Enlightenment is a difficult one. Just try it, don't overcommit yourself. Because his foundation had not yet been laid, it would be difficult for him to achieve even a high level of Enlightenment. As a result, he is actually enlightening the Dao day and night now. Is this really enlightening the Dao, I'm afraid..."

Here is a revised version of the text with improved English:

He had finally found a reason to be lazy and Xia'an couldn't believe that Lu You could actually accomplish something, given the insurmountable obstacles on the path to Marshall cultivation. The first realm conditions the skin and flesh, the second realm forges the joints and bones, the third realm refines the organs, the fourth realm replaces the blood, and the fifth realm casts the golden body. It's only after polishing the physical body to the extreme that one can touch the Dao and master the law. This was not without reason, but the culmination of the wisdom of countless predecessors who had pioneered the way of cultivation. It was absurd for Lu You to want to realize the Dao and master the law at the first realm. To Xia Wuan, it seemed like he was being too harsh on him, but this was the only way to give him a slight chance of breaking into first place in The Reincarnation Tower. Lu You's behavior left Xia Wuan a little disappointed, but he didn't stop him either. Instead, he quietly waited for Lu You to finish his seclusion.

Soon, Lu You emerged from his seclusion, his face flushed with joy, and his stomach growling with hunger. He began to Feast. Xia Wuan glanced at him and waited until he had eaten almost as much as he could before asking, "How are you enlightened?" Lu You had barely eaten an eighth of a full stomach, but he raised his head to look at his master and spoke. "My Enlightenment is not good. I've only barely realized a little bit of it after so long."

Hearing this, Xia Wuan froze, and Lu You held up his hand. "What are you looking at?" Xia Wuan glanced over and saw nothing. Lu You looked at the palm of his hand and realized that the strange writing had disappeared. He muttered to himself, "That word was still there before." 

Xia Wuan inquired, "A word? You mean an inscription?" Lu You nodded. "But it's gone." Xia Wuan said with a subtle look on his face, "Does the inscription disappear? Of course, it will disappear as long as you don't use it for a period of time. It will automatically hide itself."

Lu You tried it out, focusing his mind and mobilizing the power of the inscription, and the inscription in his hand really did emerge again, blossoming with a bit of shimmering light, proving its extraordinary nature. With the increase of this one inscription, Lu You would be much faster in both the strength of his sword and the speed of his sword, almost a qualitative leap in terms of overall strength.

Seeing this, Lu You couldn't help but be happy and quickly said, "It's really the same as what Master said." However, he remembered that when he fought those Dharma body powerhouses in the Tower of Trials before, the inscriptions on their bodies, regardless of whether they fought or died, didn't disappear -- a because theirs were just broken inscriptions, and after retracing the path of cultivation, those inscriptions were automatically destroyed.

Xia Wuan explained, "But this one of yours is a complete inscription, so naturally, you can put it away." Lu You nodded, coming to a realization. 

"How did you do it?" Xia Wuan asked in a tone that couldn't hide his dismay, as he had never thought that Lu You was not being lazy but had actually comprehended the Dao and mastered the law previously. It was a misunderstanding about him. "It's only normal to misunderstand," normally speaking, "where could one master inscriptions in one realm? This is also outrageous."

On the side, Xiao Jing, who was eating silently, was even more greatly shocked and couldn't understand. Chapter 94, "Who will leave a name that belongs to the human race enlightened?" Lu You replied, "Enlightened. Xia Wuan's face was odd. Right, Lu You smiled as he listened to Xia Wuan's words, because I'm a genius, it's not simple."

Xia Wuan had thought that Lu You sold himself short, and in the past, when Xia Wuan won, Lu You would still speak out to mock and strike a blow or two, so that he wouldn't be so inflated. But right now, he didn't really know how to retort. "It's not even a matter of Realm one Enlightenment, it's also really mastering the law successfully, condensing an inscription, and engraving it on his hand -- this is no longer something that can be described as a simple genius or demon."

After a long time, Xia Wuan nodded and spoke. "Originally, it was almost impossible for you to get first place in The Reincarnation Tower, but now, there's finally some hope, only a little hope."

Lu You asked with surprise, "When you heard this, he selected that his master was exaggerating. The Supreme treasure, the Taiyuan immortal cell, he had only comprehended this one inscription. How could anyone else have such a condition? It was basically impossible for the first realm to realize the Dao and master the law." 

Course, Xia Wuan stared at Lu You slowly nodded his head and said seriously. "The universe is vast and boundless, with countless civilized races, there are all kinds of geniuses. Even I have to admit that you, who comprehends inscriptions, are indeed a genius among geniuses nowadays. In the entire human race, among the first realm, I'm afraid no one can compare to you. You're enough to be called the first of the human race. But, just the first of the human race, if you look at the entire universe --"

The tens of thousands of civilized groups simply aren't enough for you to defeat all your opponents with a single inscription that has a sufficient basis. Any kind of monster will be born, and you can't be proud of this achievement yet. You still have to continue working hard and moving forward in order to have some hope of reaching number one in the reincarnation Tower. Hearing these words from his master and Luu nodded, I understand. It's good that you understand. Finish this meal and continue cultivating, Xiao Wuan said indifferently. Luu nodded after finishing the big meal, and Luu got up and left to continue his cultivation. Xiao Jing also hurriedly went to cultivate, leaving Xiao Yuan alone. His calm face, which was taught, looked at the direction Luu left with an odd expression on his face, as he couldn't help but mutter, "What an outrageous fellow! Mastering inscriptions at the first realm, this little guy is too outrageous. The bottom line is this guy is only three years old. This reincarnation Tower is simply not something he can break into at this age. Going to break into The Reincarnation Tower is, in itself, not a problem. It's surprising that he can really get a forward ranking. Outrageous, so outrageous." Xiao Wuan lamented repeatedly before couldn't help but ponder whether he should tell Lu Chang Shing about this news. Even Lu Chang Xing would be stunned after thinking about it. Xiao Wuan decided to hide it after The Reincarnation Tower was opened. He would naturally know it will be great to see his face again then, thinking like this, Jaia Wuan couldn't help but smile in a good mood. Time passes day by day in a flash. It was another 10 days, and this day was in the middle of the Starry Sky, the huge black hole completely tore apart, and a magnificent giant Tower appeared out of nowhere. It was clearly the rumored reincarnation Tower. At the same time, the wormholes that were like spider webs densely spread between the major star domains also completely condensed. The vast majority of civilized races were the first to receive this news. The Reincarnation Tower had opened. Punch! Countless spaceships, countless starships carrying one batch of geniuses after another spread out and vastly headed to The Reincarnation Tower. Human communities naturally are among them. The first batch of people who opened up the land had already rushed to the reincarnation Tower, and the first time they broke in, they all failed, and the one with the best score was only on the fourth floor. The higher-ups of the human Community weren't surprised by the situation but continued to send the next batch of people over. Each and every one of these people who came to the reincarnation Tower to make a break for it were geniuses and demons. One in 100,000, one in a million. However, among them, there were only a handful of people who were able to break through to the fifth floor or higher of The Reincarnation Tower and then leave their names behind. Not even one so far without exception all were eliminated. Not to mention the human Community; other ethnic groups were basically those who could come up and break through to the fifth floor. Were never rare. However, as batch after batch was sent over soon after, a Celestial Pride named Beart from the SunClan managed to break through to the fifth floor of The Reincarnation Tower. Although he was directly eliminated the moment he reached the fifth floor, he had at least left his name behind and was temporarily ranked first upon receiving this news. The great Being of the Sun Clan, the Sun God, was overjoyed and immediately spoke, "Good, very good. Our Sun tribe has temporarily contended for first place in this reincarnation Tower. Even if it's only a temporary first place, we still have to ruthlessly reward this bare heart. Reward not only him but his family as well. Transfer them to a first-class Clan. Give ShXan the first-class Medal of Honor. Find a top Emperor to be become his teacher." When the people below heard this, they hurriedly agreed. "My God, is wise at the same time." Within the Sun Clan, a small family that was not well known was directly ranked as a first-class family because of bare heart's rise. For a moment, countless honors were added to it. The Shon Clan Chief was so excited that he almost fainted. Well, well, well, bear heart is too competitive. It's not in vain for me to cultivate him at all costs. The Shon Clan Chief's face was a picture of excitement. Although he was at the King Realm, his family had risen to power because of bare heart, and this was the charm of The Reincarnation Tower. Even if it was only temporarily ranked number one, it had fought for a lot of glory for the Sun tribe. Let the Supreme Son God reward them so but, if it were quick, among the Tyin Clan, a Pride named Yun'an managed to break into the fifth level and went a little further, even though it was just a little bit. It was more than bear heart's. The Moon God of Tyen was therefore delighted and immediately rewarded Yun-an and the Ukan behind him, however this made the Sun God a little upset. If it were any other group, it would be fine to overtake them. How come it's the Tyin Community? This Tyin Community is the greatest enemy of the Sun Community belonging to the incompatibility of water and fire, two complete extremes. The hatred that the two communities had for each other was so thick that it couldn't be melted. Thus, the Sun God immediately put pressure on Shong Xan to continue to barge forward a bit and no matter what.

He was required to surpass the Tyin Clan, a battle for the honor of his pack. If he couldn't, the consequences were unavoidable, and Shong Xan's bad luck was not helping matters. Even the Shon Clan's foreign allies would have to be unlucky, as the saying goes, "Thunder and Reign are all favors of a king, not to mention a supreme god." Under such pressure, his heart, which had previously been springing to life, immediately felt an unprecedented pressure.

Meanwhile, the human race, as no one had ever broken through to the fifth floor, couldn't even leave a name if they wanted to. As a Rising group with a lot of Buzz, the human race didn't even have anyone who had entered the fifth floor, which was not good. For a moment, the entire human community was in anticipation: who would be the first to break into the fifth floor and leave a name that belongs to the human race?

Chapter 95: End of Retreat, Breaking into the Reincarnation Tower

Batch after batch of teams were sent into the Wheeling Tower, and finally, someone managed to break into the fifth floor. His name was Hong Xiao Jun. When he was in the Tower of Trials, he was originally the character with the best strength among those people, but before he could exert his original strength, he was led by Luu with 500 to 600 people and was forcefully suppressed. But at this moment, he had finally proven himself in The Reincarnation Tower. Not only did he break through to the fifth floor, but he also moved forward quite a bit and managed to leave a name that belongs to the human race.

Unfortunately, at this point, the progress of the 10,000 rac's Elites had already broken through to the sixth floor, and some were even close to the seventh layer. You've only just managed to break through to the fifth floor to leave your name behind, and you can't even catch up with someone else's tailpipe in the entire one realm reincarnation Tower ranking. The human rac's Hong xao Army was only ranked 15,781 behind Hong Xiao June, with more than 50,000,000 still ahead, and that's when the Wheeling Tower had just begun. The later it got, the fiercer the competition for The Reincarnation Tower rankings became. No one can guarantee until the last moment that they won't lose their place.

As the news of Hong Xao Army's breakthrough to the fifth level spread within the human community, there were some who were happy and some who were sad. Joy Yul, the human race is finally able to leave its name and there is finally a bit of progress, but the worry is that after all these days of hard work, only one person has temporarily broken into the fifth layer, or more than 10,000,000 this progress, this momentum is really not very good.

Although in the universe, the advantages of the human race in the lower Realms are very conspicuous, and there are even quite a few disadvantages, there is no way to compare with some naturally powerful races in the past. Every time The Reincarnation tower opened, the human Race's results were unsatisfactory, it wasn't until a few reincarnation Towers opened up behind them that they caught up, but anyway, for whatever reason, just over 10,000,000 is too much of a setback. The previous times of The Reincarnation Tower, it wasn't as bad as this, this is really unacceptable to many people.

Soon as a few days pass, the human race had hundreds of people successively break into the fifth layer, among them Hong Xiao Jun who had the fastest progress even managed to kill his way to the sixth floor. It's just a shame that as soon as you reach the sixth level, you're eliminated at the speed of light. However, the overall Place ranking is surging, 1, 9th nearly broke one 0000 th place, this is the best the human race has done so far, this cheered up many people. Killing around a thousand in one breath proved that there was still hope for the human race. It's a thousand now, after that, it might be in the top 500 or even the top 100 or 10, unfortunately, imagination is beautiful, reality is cruel.

When the Honga Army broke through to the sixth level, the large force of the universal 10,000 races two killed here as these 10,000,000 plus foreigners came to kill directly squeezing Hong xuan's ranking to five 000,000 places and in the blink of an eye another nine 000,000 places. But only half a day's time looking at Hong xuan's results again to rank 10,000,000 to the back, the competition is just too tough. Almost all the time the roster is in flux, this was something that even Hong Xiao Jun did not expect. He had gone through a lot of trouble and managed to break through to the sixth floor, and before he had time to catch his breath, his ranking had once again returned to more than 10,000,000, which was really despairing.

In the spaceship Hong Xiao Jun looked at his ranking constantly moving backward, his face became more and more ugly, he couldn't help but lament before I always heard people say that this reincarnation Tower is difficult to the extreme, but I don't have any real feeling thinking that with the strength I have after I remastered it, what can be difficult for me? I didn't expect, ah, this reincarnation Tower, it's really hard to this extent. I was thinking about taking a well-deserved break, regrouping, and taking advantage of the two remaining opportunities to break in again, and maybe have a shot at killing it in the 500s, who would have thought that the Geniuses of the 10,000 races would be this tough.

In this universe, the mere thought of being compressed to 10,000 would overwhelm me once more. As Hong Xuan spoke, Jong Donga, Jing XI, and Shia Jeene, who stood by, couldn't help but nod in agreement, their faces etched with sadness. "It's incredibly challenging," they said. "The competition in this Reincarnation Tower is far more intense than we ever imagined. How confident he was before entering the cycle, and how uncertain he is now."

Hong's Army had managed to break into the 10,000s, though it was now over 10,000 strong. However, the others could barely reach the fifth floor, and in the overall rankings, they couldn't even see the top. John Don Court was ranked at 7,600,000, Jing XI at 5,900,000, and Shia Jeene was slightly better, temporarily ranking at 360,000. This was the state of the human hordes. Hundreds of the best performers had been killed on the fifth floor, yet their rankings were dismal. The worst was said to be ranked over 186 million, eliminated upon first entering the fifth level. This meant there were currently at least 186 million on the fifth level of the Reincarnation Tower.

As for the fifth layer downwards, countless foreign races were constantly breaking through. Some foreign races had pushed through to the sixth layer with one life, while others struggled to reach the fifth layer. Every moment, every second, the rankings shifted. They truly experienced what it meant to have competition among the 10,000 races of the universe. It was incredibly intense.

Just then, Jang Donga asked, "Where's Luu? Has he come?" Upon hearing that name, several people inside the spaceship froze. Zonu thought for a moment and said, "It doesn't seem like it. I haven't heard any news of him coming over yet, so I guess he hasn't broken into the Reincarnation Tower yet."

"Is he afraid to come?" Xiaan said with a frown. "With his character, it shouldn't be." Ziu shook his head. "I don't know the specifics either. I've heard news of him, and it seems that he's in seclusion." Siabi spoke up, "Going into seclusion?" Hearing this, Jong Donga said with an odd expression, "He really does have a big heart, being able to hold back from coming over to break into the Reincarnation Tower. He's still in seclusion at his level of strength. No matter how much more he secludes himself for a while, he won't be able to improve much, right?"

Hong Xiao Jun spoke, "You can't just come up here and get defeated. You definitely need to shut down properly." Soon, the topic was skipped over. No matter what, Luu was just a three-year-old child. Should they still expect him to represent the human race and break into the Reincarnation Tower to get a top ranking? It just didn't make sense anymore. It wasn't like the geniuses of the human race were all dead. How dare they pin all their hopes on a three-year-old child? If this kind of thing were to be spread out, all the races in the universe would have to laugh their asses off.

Exactly. Although Luu was in seclusion and did not participate in the first opening teams, no one came to rush him or put pressure on him. The big guys of the human race seemed to have forgotten him, this little genius. In the meantime, on Blue Star Jia, in Yuan's mansion in the 10,000 Swords Pavilion, Luu on Le Futan slowly opened his eyes. The retreat had ended. Counting the time, it had been some days since the Reincarnation Tower had opened, and it was time for him to make a break for it.

Chapter 96: Hope for the Human Race. In fact, some days earlier, Luu knew about the news of the opening of the Reincarnation Tower. However, he wasn't in that much of a hurry to get to the openings compared to those heavenly Prides of the 10,000 races of the universe. What Luu liked the most was not natural talent, heritage, or enlightenment, but time. The time he had spent practicing was too short. Time was especially precious after he had found a way to continue getting stronger. One more inscription comprehended, the strength would be one point stronger. As of now, he had mastered a total of 13 inscriptions. It was no exaggeration to say that these 13 inscriptions had almost transformed him. The strength was a far cry from what it was back then. If the current him were to face the Jung-dong Pavilion few people from back then again, even if the opposite side were to play a Wheel battle again, he would be able to effortlessly and easily solve it.

"Have to say, this Taiu Immortal cell is really good, as expected," Luu thought. "It's worthy of being in the ninth-order Supreme treasure. I have benefited greatly from just one realm, and as the realm rises up, the gain of this enlightenment is only higher. With my current strength, I don't know how far I can break in." Luu couldn't help but ponder. These days, he had been in seclusion, knowing very little about the many things that were happening in the outside world. Even the heroes of the great Sia chat group had not been opened, so it could be said that he was fully devoted to cultivation. At the moment, he had just come out of the gate, so naturally, he had to go and find out more. Without understanding it, Luu could not help but...

He was a bit surprised when he finally understood the situation. Currently, the highest ranking a human has reached in the Wheeling Tower is 1,9, but it only lasted half a day before being pushed down to 100,000. At the moment, there are nearly a thousand humans who have broken through to the fifth floor, but their specific rankings are miserable, typically falling between hundreds of thousands and millions of names, and in some cases, even over 100 million.

Overall, the situation is not good. Despite the Reincarnation Tower opening multiple times, the human race has not had good results, especially in the lower realms. However, some people argue that there is no need to be discouraged, as the human race's advantage will become apparent in the higher level reincarnation towers.

Regardless, the inner circle of the human race is in an uproar, with some condemning the so-called geniuses for being a disgrace and not even able to make it into the top 100. Others give a more reasonable explanation, stating that the human race is not superior in the lower realms, so it is normal for them to not have good results in the first realm reincarnation towers.

Amidst the discussion, not many people mention Luu's name. He realizes that this is because they do not want to put pressure on a three-year-old by having high expectations. However, Luu has already proven his strength in the tower of trials, so he is not belittled.

The heroes of the Grand Summer chat group have pinned their hopes on Luu, believing that as long as he steps into the Reincarnation Tower, he will be able to solve any problems. As soon as Luu announces that he is coming out of the gate, the group is buzzing with excitement. They believe that Luu is the hope of the human race and that he will surely leave their name at the top of the list.

Luu smiles and replies that he is confident, but the Reincarnation Tower is harder than he imagined. He will do his best to break into the top rankings.

Xia Wuan, who is feeding the koi, asks Luu if he is planning to break in. Luu nods, stating that he cannot continue his seclusion any longer, as he does not want to fall behind schedule. The opening time of the first realm reincarnation tower is one month away, and about 10 days have passed. Luu continues to cultivate and master new inscriptions, but it is equally important for him to break into the Reincarnation Tower to adapt.

Navigating through internal challenges, finding the optimal breaking rhythm was crucial. Entering the Reincarnation Tower under a time limit could lead to disastrous consequences. Fortunately, Luu still had 20 days to break in. Xia Wanan, after feeding the fish, clapped his hands, notifying Xiao Jing to join him at the Reincarnation Tower.

Excited for this opportunity, Xiao Jing had been cultivating for this day, to enter the tower alongside his brother. As they traveled to the tower, Luu, the Marshall Saints' son, received internal information about the tower and some alien powerhouses. His authority was high, granting him access to this valuable data.

Upon reviewing the information, Luu realized the vastness and complexity of the universe. There were far more races than the commonly known 10,000, and some civilizations were isolated, unable to communicate with the rest. These communities were often imprisoned by vast vacuum zones called Cosmic Walls, which required wormholes to traverse.

In the data, Luu discovered super-geniuses from these isolated civilizations, including a lizard-headed Dhab powerhouse, Nansi Curly, and others. The Reincarnation Tower rankings showcased the incredible strength of these individuals, with Synthic of the Poseidon Clan, an unknown Starfield's civilization, in first place.

This information emphasized the immense scale of the universe and the diverse talents it harbored. Luu and Xiao Jing continued their journey to the Reincarnation Tower, now more aware of the challenges they would face.

Instantly, he felt the pressure of the universal 10,000 races, which were indeed as strong as the clouds. Even an existence like Jong Dong Pavilion had unexpectedly ranked seven six million. This was just too much. The S-Class spaceship, Polaris, was fast, and it was only about 10 hours before it arrived at the entrance to the Wormhole located in the human Colony. After entering the Wormhole and flying for another 2 hours, they finally arrived at their destination. As the ship rushed out of the Wormhole, a vast, infinite Tower leapt into view. This was The Reincarnation Tower. Xiao Jing was dumbfounded.
"That's right," Xiao Wuan said indifferently. "As a matter of fact, we're already in The Reincarnation Tower secret realm."
Xiao Wuan's words made Luu a little surprised. As he carefully perceived it, he did feel a little different, but he couldn't tell where it was different.
"That's right," Xiaan Yuan said slowly. "The great power who created The Reincarnation Tower mastered at least three great Avenues: the great da of space, the great da of life, and the great da of death. This Reincarnation Tower is extremely special. Even if the universe is broken in born and reincarnated countless times, this Reincarnation Tower, however, still stands."
Listening to Xiao Wuan's narration, Luu's heart was shaken. Even though he had already known all of this before, this time, he still couldn't help but marvel when he heard it again.
"I will bring you to the entrance of the first level of The Reincarnation Tower next," Xiao Wuan said indifferently. "It's up to you guys to see where you can break in."
The two agreed in the blink of an eye. The ship drilled into the entrance of the Wheeling Tower. Just then, a prompt suddenly appeared in front of Luu's eyes, a prompt very similar to a system panel.
"You have entered the confines of The Reincarnation Tower. Do you wish to enter the first floor and undergo the test of The Reincarnation Tower?"
Luu was slightly surprised when he looked at the prompt. Almost thinking that his system panel had popped up. Upon closer inspection, though, there were some differences. For example, the text was unfamiliar, but Luu just could read what it meant.
"Just meditate on acceptance," Xia Wuan spoke at this time.
Luu didn't think anymore about it and accepted it directly. The next moment, Luu appeared on top of a ring, not far away. Way was a rock giant that stood over 10 meters tall. His whole body stood there like a small mountain. At this moment, he looked at the little bitty man in front of him with dismay.
"How did a little doll come? Wasn't this a victory for nothing in the first round? You're really unlucky. It's not too late for you to admit defeat now, or else if you're killed by me, you'll be eliminated straight away in the ring battle on the first level. If you are killed, it would be declared that you had failed to break through the barrier, and that would be the end of it. On the contrary, if you admit defeat, you can continue to fight until you have saved up 10 wins. That's the trick to breaking in on the first level. When you meet an absolutely strong enemy, surrender decisively. If you're not careful about getting seconds, then you're just eliminated the moment you meet them."
Hearing this, Luu raised his head to observe the big guy in front of him of the Rock God race. Luu opened his mouth and asked, "Of the human race? Fire in the Rock? Your name seems a bit familiar."
Fire in the Rock grinned. Luu this name of yours, it seems a bit familiar. It's not too late for you to admit defeat now, or else if you're killed by me, you'll be eliminated straight away in the ring battle on the first level. If you are killed, it would be declared that you had failed to break through the barrier, and that would be the end of it.

Head and said, "I won't admit defeat. You can admit defeat instead. You can't beat me." Fire in The Rock was kind enough to warn him, but this little doll even got on his nerves. He even asked him to admit defeat. What a joke.

Meanwhile, the Rock God Clan was broadcasting the battle on nearly a hundred planets. Rock Central Flame, a pride of the Rock God Clan who had previously broken through to the sixth floor with the highest ranking of 812, was now regrouping and striking again. For a while, almost the entire Rock God Clan was watching his charge with fire in the Rock appearing in the ring. Tens of billions of spectators shouted in unison, "Fire in the Rock! Fire in the Rock! Fire in the Rock!" Without a doubt, he was the pride of the entire Rock God Clan. Who was he up against? As the figure slowly coalesced, the host responsible for the end of the broadcast froze, and so did the viewers of the Rock God Clan's nearly a hundred planets. What the hell? Rock Central Fire's opponent was actually a little doll. This little doll's name is Luu.

Why does the name sound familiar? The host quickly reacted, "Isn't this the Crown Prince of the human race? Hahha!" The host couldn't help but let out a bright smile and then turned to the camera with an excited face. "I didn't expect it! I didn't expect it! The hero of our Rock God Clan actually encountered in the first round. The son of the human Marshall Saint, the only son of that 10 Realm of the human race, Luu. I'm sure everyone has heard his story. In the previous human race Emperor star trial selection, he recklessly played with the rules. That was clearly a one-on-one trial, but he gathered hundreds of people and pushed across the entire Battlefield and even got the first place. Afterwards, to avoid things getting too big, the organizers gave more than 10,000,000 extra spots. It was like a handout to those geniuses of the human race. I really didn't expect that such an arrogant and domineering little guy would actually dare to come and break into The Reincarnation Tower. Could it be that he thinks this Reincarnation Tower is a trial selection for other races, and that anyone would deliberately give way to him because of his status? It has to be said, this is a battle without suspense, but it's an interesting one, all the same. Friends of the audience, please record the next footage so that we can witness how the son of the human Clan's Marshall Saint was ravaged by our genius. This video should fetch a good price.

Accompanied by the host's voice, the Rock God race spectators of nearly a hundred planets one by one became excited. Compared to the Rock God race, the human race was a newly risen and powerful group. The Rock God race could only be considered a medium group, and their overall strength was much worse. If it was abusing the geniuses of the human race, it was nothing at all. There were simply too many geniuses of the human race, and the human race didn't have an advantage in the early Realms in the first place. It wasn't something to be proud of at all. But if it was the Crown Prince of the human race, it would be a completely different story. It was a pretty interesting fight.

On the live broadcast screen, Rock Center Fire couldn't bear to abuse this little doll. He quickly admitted defeat and said, "Rock Center Fire is not my opponent at all." Seeing this scene, many of the Rock God Clan spectators burst out laughing. It's true that he's the arrogant and bossy Prince who's used to it. You're so fearless that you think everyone will give in to you. This is a battle of all the Clans, not you playing house by yourself. Hearing this, Rock Center Fire was obviously rendered speechless and directly stopped speaking. Unlike the Rock God Clan's high level of concern on the human side, no one had relayed Luu's battle yet. Not many people even knew that Luu had already come out of the gate to break into The Reincarnation Tower because he had only mentioned this matter in the heroes of the great summer group. He had rushed straight to the Reincarnation Tower, so the news hadn't spread for a while. The 100-second lead time ended quickly, and the battle had begun.

The fire in the Rock raised its huge palm and casually slapped it down, as if it were an ant. As the palm of the hand fell, it was as if a mountain peak had tumbled down, giving rise to a sense of despair that was hard to resist. L was a bit surprised and jumped back violently to avoid the slap. Boom! The slap made a loud noise as it hit the ring. The little bugs are quick to escape. Fire in The Rock grinned and continued to attack. As he ran, the ground rumbled almost like an earthquake. The difficulty of The Reincarnation Tower is really high. A random opponent is so strong, or is it because of my strength that I was matched with this kind of opponent? Luu thought like this and continued to observe Fire in The Rock's moves. With several attacks being easily dodged, Fire in The Rock became a little impatient. His eyes widened. "Damn little bug, all you can do is run away, L." Luu heard this but smiled, unmoved. A few simple observations were enough. There was no need to keep playing around. Without the slightest hesitation, he swung out.

His sword, a puman sword, flashed with light. At first, this sword was considered his killing move. If used even a little, a few times, he would run out of energy. However, this sword, lifted and relaxed, chopped away streams of light, sword intent like fire, fast to the extreme. Fire in the Rock snorted coldly and resisted hard with his powerful physical body. Sure enough, it didn't hurt at all; a scratchy attack.

Next, Fire in the Rock was still planning to attack again but was shocked to realize his body was out of command. The large head then rolled down with a loud bang. Fire in the Rock was eliminated.

After defeating his strong enemy, Luu remained expressionless, as if it were a trivial and insignificant matter, a result to be taken for granted. Meanwhile, the spectators on nearly 100 planets all stared in disbelief when they saw this scene. This one living planet at this moment seemed to be dead silent.

This chapter is a reward plus chapter 99. "How is that possible?"

As early as when Luu had dodged Fire in the Rock's attacks a few times, some spectators had sensed that something was wrong. "This Crown Prince of the human race, it seems that he is not the rumored straw man, but still has some strength. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to dodge the attack of Fire in the Rock several times. Ordinary goods would have been slapped into muchh long ago. He, on the other hand, has managed to dodge it repeatedly. That speed alone is extraordinary."

"Sure enough, rumors still can't be completely trusted. Thinking about it, it was right. At least he was the heir of a 10 realm or the only son. How could he really be a simple commodity, but not much of a threat? If it's just body agility after all, while Fire in the Rock could miss 10,000 times, he couldn't miss once. Just miss once, and it's death."

Just as all the Rock God race spectators were thinking this, Luu struck out with his sword. Just one sword chopped out. The movement of Fire in the Rock suddenly stopped, and the next thing is that the huge head rolled down with a bang. At this instant, all the Rock God race spectators were confused one by one. They all couldn't help but rub their eyes. Was that a blur or were they hallucinating? They actually saw that Fire in the Rock was killed by a sword. Is this really not a dream?

No, that's true. These Rock God clansmen for a moment could not believe their eyes, much less accept such a fact. Just now, also in the passionate commentary host at this moment opened his mouth but half a long time could not speak. His face was turned reddish purple, almost fainted on the spot. The word went up quickly.

The Supreme Being of the Rock God Clan, the Rock God, couldn't help but be furious after hearing this news. "No, the human race, Luu of the human race! He's actually this strong! Who the hell was roaring that he was an arrogant and domineering prince in the first place? Go find out for me! If we hadn't been misled by this news, Fire in the Rock definitely wouldn't have lost so badly. The human race is a powerful race. The Rock God race can't afford to mess with it for the time being, so they can only vent their anger on the person who spread the rumor in the first place."

In the meantime, when Fire in the Rock was eliminated, he returned to the spaceship he was in. Compared to the tall Stone man next to him, the 10 odd meter height of Fire in the Rock was rather small. That was his master, and likewise, his high grandfather, Rock Luo. The strength was the ninth realm, a great emperor. Rock Luo glanced at the returning Rock Central Fire with some surprise and asked strangely, "How come it's over so quickly?"

"I was eliminated," Fire in the Rock was speechless for a moment and only after a long time did he say.

"Eliminated by whom?" Rock Luo asked in surprise. "Could it be that with your defense and strength, you couldn't admit defeat in time? Did you meet the top few experts in The Reincarnation Tower rankings?"

Fire in the Rock shook his head and said helplessly, "What Master said, I naturally kept it in my heart. If I encountered those top-ranked experts, I would never go up to challenge them without any self-importance but rather decisively chose to surrender and save the victories. But the opponent this time, I simply couldn't imagine that he had such strength. The speed of his moves was just too fast. I didn't even react and was eliminated. Who is he?"

Rock Luo asked with some curiosity. "Who has such an ability? Seems to be a human fellow who seems to be very young in age, and his name is Luu," Fire in the Rock replied.

"Human race Luu?" Hearing this name, Rock Luo was puzzled for a moment and quickly remembered. "Could it be him?"

"You know, Master?" Fire in the Rock hurriedly inquired.

Rock Luo nodded and slowly said, "You should have heard of his reputation before. The only son of the human Marshall Saint. So it's him."

Fire in the Rock's eyes widened before he reacted. "No wonder he always felt that the name Luu sounded a bit familiar. But how could he be so strong?"

Fire in the Rock said with some doubt. Rock Luo glanced at this foolish disciple of his. "Obviously, the rumors aren't believable. How could the only son of a Marshall Saint be really weak?" And with the matching mechanism of the first level of The Reincarnation Tower,

Here is the improved English text, maintaining the original meaning:

You definitely won't win this one, and you're down to your last chance. Are you going to break in now or are you going to spend a few days cultivating and try again later? Fire in the Rock heard this and thought for a moment before deciding, "I'm going to spend a few days cultivating before making a final break through." This failure left him feeling unlucky, and he thought he would have to do better next time. In the meantime, Luu would need to get in shape. Luu's easy victory over the highest-ranked Rock God expert in the tower, with rank 812, quickly spread as news. No one had expected the prince of the human race, who had been mocked by all the other races at the start, to defeat such a formidable opponent. The ease with which he had dispatched him with a sword was not something to be underestimated. As the news spread, it caused quite a stir within the human community. In fact, it became an afterthought on the side of the human community these days. Many people discovered that the first level of the Reincarnation Tower had a hidden matching mechanism, which meant that the stronger you were, the easier it was to match up with the best. This was only relative, of course, as there were also examples of weak ones being frequently matched with strong ones. It wasn't 100% a powerhouse matchup, it was just a relatively high probability of success. Luu's second opponent, Amisha, was a long-haired woman in a white dress, her eyes were a turquoise color, and her appearance was extremely beautiful. She looked extremely similar to a human face, apart from her slightly longer ears and the pair of translucent wings on her back. Elves. Luu asked curiously, "Amisha, you are an elf, right?" Amisha, who was wearing long white hair and a white dress, nodded and smiled. "Little brother, are you of the human race?" Luu nodded, "Yes, big sister." Amisha continued, "Then you'd better surrender or else you won't be able to surrender if you're chopped by my sword." Luu couldn't help but chuckle as Amisha's words were said in a serious tone, despite her gentle and cute appearance. "Don't bluff me with words like that," she said, shaking her head. "My highest ranking is 988, and there's absolutely no way you can decapitate me with a single sword." Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows at this revelation, as she was stronger than Hong Xiao Jun and even surpassed the Rock God expert he had beaten earlier. As the countdown ended, Luu decided to take the lead. The moment he swung his sword out, Luu's blade flashed through the air, shining like a beacon of destruction. At the instant the sword light was swung out, Amisha felt a shiver run down her spine as her body's instincts kept warning her, "Danger, danger, danger!" She hastily raised her hand to resist, but a layer of translucent light shield surfaced at the position of her raised arm. However, the light shield was shredded in just an instant, as if it couldn't hold out for even a moment. Amisha's heart was appalled as she felt a sense of shock wash over her. How was it possible? Luu's sword was really too fast. It made no difference if she was a high-ranking elf like herself; she couldn't even get a hit off. Amisha found herself in a life-or-death crisis, unable to even try to surrender. And then it occurred to her that what Luu had just said to her wasn't a joke. It was a cold reminder. Unfortunately, it was too late for regrets. The instant the light shield shattered, Luu's sword had already found its mark. It cleanly severed her two jade arms, and the sword's momentum continued unabated as it cut off her entire body without even a breath. Amisha collapsed into a pool of her own blood. She couldn't help but look at Luu's figure, as if memorizing his appearance. Her eyes seemed to be trying to remember the memory of her last second in the game. Luu looked down at her body, and with a soft expression, he said, "This is the expert whose highest ranking is 988. How come it feels weaker than the last one?" Amisha, who was struggling to raise her head, let out a disappointed snort, feeling humiliated as she realized her limitations. For a while, she felt anxious and angry, and before she could process her emotions further, she was directly eliminated from the game. In the meantime, the elves tuning into this game were stunned, their expressions shocked. "My elf God no way," one of them exclaimed. "The little guy from the human race is actually this strong?" Another elf couldn't help but express his amazement. He exclaimed, "He's the Crown Prince of the human race, I heard. Luu that prince of the human race is rumored to be an arrogant and bossy guy. But with a sword like this, who can compete?" With Amisha eliminated, a sudden shockwave spread throughout the Elven community. The news that the elf God Amisha, who had high hopes of breaking into the top 500 or less, had been killed by a sword was too much for them to take in. They couldn't even begin to imagination just how strong Luu's opponent really was.

Here is the revised text with improved English:

The strongest being in the elf clan who ranked higher than 100 did not dare to proclaim that he could defeat Amisha in a single strike. Is this not, in effect, saying that Marshall Ha, the only son of the human race, possesses the strength of the top 100 or even higher if he can decapitate Amisha with a single sword? There was no doubt that Luu, who was already gaining fame, was once again celebrated throughout human communities upon his return. His arrival had finally led to the news being shared throughout the tower, and men rushed to verify it for themselves. Since any race could access the breakthroughs of people from their own race and could also share them in real-time. They soon saw Luu's combat record unfold, which included one battle against The Rock God Clans and two battles against Amisha of the Elves.

It's incredible luck that both The Rock and Amisha broke into the top thousand rankings. It's solid top-notch power, of course. However, Luu emerged victorious every time. When they checked the details, they were directly stunned. The first battle against The Rock took 1 minute and 3 seconds to conclude, and Luu won decisively. In contrast, the battle against Amisha took only 7 seconds to end, with Luu emerging victorious.

What's suspicious with 7 seconds? Right off the bat, even if Amisha was slightly weaker than The Rock, the difference was hardly that great. How could Amisha have been defeated so quickly? This is just too much. However, this was the information automatically recorded by The Reincarnation Tower, and it was not fake. Luu had literally decapitated Amisha in 7 seconds. When word got back to the human community, there was no doubt about it. The entire human community was abuzz, and even several Marshall Kings and martial emperors couldn't help but applaud. In the major internet forums, the news about Luu was an explosive piece of good news. Marshall Saints only son, Luu, had begun to break into The Reincarnation Tower, and he was becoming invincible.

When people asked about his opponents, Luu's opponents were both Supreme experts within the highest ranking of 1,000. This seemed unfair. "Lou, you won't win right?" some people said, but of course, Luu had emerged victorious. "Even this fight cannot be won," they said. Luu's opponents were indeed impressed by Luu's strength. When asked about his opponents, Luu replied, "I'll just let you admit defeat." Warang, who had heard that Luu's opponents were both within the highest ranking of 1000, looked down upon him. "How did you know they were ranked so high?" Warang asked Luu, sneering. "I'm pitiful, so I let you know," Luu replied. Warang smiled and said, "You're really lucky to have been defeated by my sword."

Luu shook his head in disbelief, staring in astonishment for a moment. There was a hint of disbelief in his voice as he asked, "Is this little guy really not joking? No, it can't be. That joke of yours isn't funny." Luu frowned and shook his head, saying, "Actually, I was quite surprised. It was my first time breaking into the Reincarnation Tower, and I didn't expect that those few people wouldn't even be able to stop me from using a sword. It may not be that they are too weak, but that I am too strong."

Hearing these calm words from Luu, Hu Yuan's heart was in a state of awe and disbelief. "No dude, are you serious? No, not right. Definitely bluffing, it can't be that simple to be fooled." Luu let out a deep breath, his eyes gradually becoming resolute. "It's useless even if you say that I won't be disturbed by you." Luu smiled helplessly as 100 seconds flew by. In the next instant, Luu casually swung his sword, and Waring's head flew high in the air, his eyes filled with dismay. "So it was all true, but what the hell kind of matching mechanism is this?" At this point, the battle was over. Combat Time: 1 second. It was over without even a second to be exact.

Luu's face remained calm at this moment, and he had a feeling of open speed. It was obvious that every meeting was a second, but waiting for the battle to start took a full 100 seconds. Time wasted, but that was the rule, and he couldn't change it. As this sword cut out, there was no doubt that the entire human community boiled over with excitement. Hundreds of millions of viewers all couldn't help but shout out as they watched the live broadcast in front of them. The previous rumors after all were just that - rumors. This moment of live broadcast was seeing is believing. A sword, what a fast sword, taking out your opponent in a flash, and the fight took a second. The gap was just too big. What an unlucky foreigner boy. Cool, it was awesome, worthy of being the son of a marshal saint. Who still says that the first place in the Tower of Trials has no gold content? This opponent is ranked 990,000, so it's actually not that bad. It was still instantly secured these previous days with successive losses and a best result of no more than a thousand. The entire human community was depressed, although people said on their lips that the human race didn't have too much of an advantage in the early realms, and that the next few reincarnation Towers caught up with them. Who wouldn't want to see the human race start battling it out in the first few reincarnation Towers if they could? Reasons are just reasons. The foreigners taunt you, and you still have no way to refute it, but can only grit your teeth and say, "We'll see." The human race is bound to grow thick and thin, but now the hope of the human race has at last appeared. At this moment, Luu had already won three consecutive victories, and at this rate, would 10 consecutive victories be far behind?

Blue Star cabinet meeting, Jonza held his chin in boredom and quickly browsed through the information. Suddenly, he saw something, and his eyes lit up. "Who is Luu? It's really the teacher's son. Without realizing it, he has become so strong. Whether it's an expert ranked around a thousand or a million, it's all chopped up with one sword. This strength is quite okay. I don't know which floor can he break into." Lu Xang Hong, who was presiding over the cabinet meeting, saw Jonza not far away muttering and not knowing what he was muttering about and couldn't help but ask, "Shonza, is there something going on? Can you just say it out loud for us to hear?"

Hearing this, Jonza raised his head and said directly, "About the Reincarnation Tower. The Reincarnation Tower, what happened to the Reincarnation Tower? A rising star has appeared in the human race. Tell me about it." The crowd heard this and asked Jonza, who smiled and continued, "That little fellow Luu, you all should remember just now he also went to break into the Reincarnation Tower. How did it turn out? Someone subconsciously asked, "I heard that he participated in the Tower of Trials and fooled around before, but I didn't realize that he really went to break into the Reincarnation Tower." Someone said in surprise, and Jonza didn't sell himself short and said with a smile, "Very good, very good. An expert within a thousand of the highest rankings of the Reincarnation Tower, and he just gave it a chop with a single sword. When these words came out, the cabinet, which was still lively and full of pleasant air, instantly fell silent. Everyone stared in disbelief. What, what did you say? This, as cabinet ministers, basically all of them were hundreds of years old, and one of them was not too bad in terms of strength, so they naturally knew that the gold content of this sword decapitation was quite significant. It was only quiet for a long while, but the cabinet was once again bustling with activity. The crowd couldn't help but mingle, and there were even quite a few people who didn't care about the occasion and directly opened the broadcasting platform to watch the battle live.

Lu Shanghong listened to the noisy voices before he came back to his senses, and he said in dismay, "Surprisingly, it's so powerful." Meanwhile, near the Tower of Reincarnation, Hong Xao Jun Jong Donga Jing XI Shia Jean, and Zonu were the few people who received this news coincidentally. Luu is out of the gate. Luu has broken into the Reincarnation Tower, and Luu has begun to make a killing.

The three consecutive opponents, two of whom held the highest rankings within A, and one with a ranking of 990,000, were all effortlessly defeated by Hong Xuan. His eyes widened in disbelief, finding it hard to accept that his highest ranking hadn't even made it into the top 1,000. Jang Donga exclaimed in surprise, "His seclusion has truly paid off. He's indeed been in seclusion." Jeni was taken aback, "This progress is too exaggerated. There's no doubt that he's much stronger than when he was in the Tower of Trial and Refinement." Shia Jin's scalp tingled as he thought, "Before, I wondered if Luu dared not come, but I didn't expect this to hit me in the face."

There was an update: Luu had defeated another opponent with a single sword kill. How strong was the opponent this time? His highest ranking was 5,133. Other people broke through the barrier, speeding past and receiving rewards. Inside the spaceship, several people were in a daze. Jing She had even more mixed feelings. Thinking back to the other day in the Tower of Trials, he was still able to hold his own against Luu, although he was ultimately defeated. He had almost pushed Luu to the end of his limits, and his energy was almost depleted. He heard that in the end, Luu was even pushed and directly raised his arm, sweeping the entire trial battlefield with 500 to 600 people. How long had it been since their original encounter in the Tower of Trials? How could Luu have become so strong?

Jeni's mind was shaken. In the Reincarnation Tower, his best result was not even able to rush in at the 10,000th place. Luu, however, was able to kill the highest-ranked expert with a single sword. Jing She couldn't help but believe it. Suddenly, Jing She remembered the intelligence he had seen earlier when Luu participated in the Tower of Trials. The time he started cultivating was but a month. In just one month, he was able to eliminate Jang Donga, Zongi Wu, and him in succession. Now, a month had also passed since the Tower of Trials, so it seemed reasonable for Luu to become so strong.

Jing She spoke out his thoughts, and a few people on the side froze when they heard this. "This does not make sense. What kind of person gets stronger without any bottleneck at all? This cultivation to become stronger was simply the same as eating and drinking water. They had cultivated for so long, they had simply cultivated to the dogs. It can only be described as heavenly and terrifying." Jang Donga couldn't help but say with emotion, "Suddenly, I thought of the words my cousin Yangang Bangu had comforted me with so long ago. Brother Luu is so powerful. It's normal that you can't defeat him. It's not that you're too weak, it's that he's too strong."

At that time, Jiangdong, who was ashamed, could not be comforted. Almost saved headlong as the blood rushed up in his veins, but a great man can stretch. He eventually slowed down and adjusted his mind. At this moment, looking back, he suddenly realized that he was not as good as his cousin Jiang Bangu in the beginning to see through it. In fact, not to mention them, even a marshall king who brought them over couldn't help but sigh at this moment. "Is this the son of the Marshall Saint? This kind of talent is really enviable." After so many years of cultivation, he had only managed to enter the Marshall King realm, and he already felt that it was difficult to move forward by an inch. If he didn't have any strange encounters in the future, he would more than likely stop here as a matter of fact.

A marshall king realm powerhouse was already a genius among geniuses and a demon among demons. Casting the golden body, realizing the Dharma body, creating the Dharma phase, controlling the domain, and stepping into the rules to break through this difficult barrier and step over this mountain in order to achieve the Marshall King realm. At almost every hurdle, countless people are stopped. But it was such a marshall king who was envious of Luu's talent at this moment. When Jang Donga and the others heard this, their hearts were shocked, but they didn't even feel that there was anything wrong. Don't look at the fact that there was only a difference of one realm between the Marshall Emperor realm and the Marshall King realm. But if we were to talk about the difficulty, this was going to be a lot harder than all of the difficult levels in front of it put together. The further back you go, the harder the road gets. Natural talent and enlightenment are so important.

Not far from Jong Donga and the others, there was an extremely large spacecraft. This was the official Diaa, the Airship that specialized in transporting geniuses to this place. Inside the Airship, at the moment, it was not overcrowded, but it was a bit crowded. Whether it was to go to the cultivation field or to take a bath or to eat, all of them needed to queue up. They were the geniuses of the major planets, but there were just too many geniuses to be worth anything, given the immense total. At first, they were complaining, but now they were in awe of Luu's strength.

The official attitude towards them was too lax; they were fighting for the honor of the human race, yet the treatment they received was merely average. However, after they broke into the Reincarnation Tower, each and every one of them became determined, fighting for the human race. How can one talk about competing for glory when they can't even make it to the fifth floor and leave their name behind? Of course, there were individual geniuses who had fought their way into the fifth level, but the rankings were generally in the tens of millions, with the better ones in the millions and hundreds of thousands. This is the cruelty of competition among the 10,000 races.

It's true that they are geniuses of the human race, but in the scope of the entire universe, they are nothing. Just then, a message traveled through the ship: the Marshall Saint's only son had come to break into the Reincarnation Tower. Even though he was still fighting a ring battle on the first floor, his opponents were not simple; within the four of them, three had the highest rankings within a thousand. However, even with such powerful opponents, he chopped them down with his sword.

Upon hearing this news, many people's first reaction was disbelief, while more people couldn't help but burst out laughing. No one will believe it, after all, this is just crazy. The human race has not broken into the thousand or less so far. As a result, such an expert appearing here is unbelievable. But a sword chopped them down, no way, absolutely not.

As the word spread, more and more people gathered around the screens in the event plaza inside the massive airship. The fight was being broadcast, believe it or not, they crowded in unanimously to get a glimpse. Then, these geniuses of the human race saw a scene they would never forget. A sword, a sword, still a sword, regardless of any opponent he encountered. A strong person from any ethnic group, Lu You would always kill them with a single sword strike. Whether it was the highest ranked around 500 or around 10,000,000, without exception, none of them could block Lu You's sword. Fierce, it's too vicious.

Inside the huge spaceship, all the human geniuses subconsciously held their breaths as they looked at the image in front of them. The scene was silent, and the originally noisy event square was actually pin-drop silent. Everyone's scalp was numb, and goosebumps rose all over their body. Even the passing Marshall King stared blankly at the screen with a shocked expression.

Lu You achieved ten consecutive victories without any suspense, easily breaking through the first barrier. Next, Lu You didn't stop too much and headed directly to the second level, then the third, the fourth, and the fifth level. Obviously, these layers of hurdles were all difficult hurdles for the geniuses of the 10,000 races of the universe, and they needed to go through them slowly. But for Lu You, it was as simple as eating and drinking. A sweeping punchline, while others were breaking in, he played speed pass accompanied by the roaring collapse of the Guardian monster of the fifth level. Lu You stepped lightly on his feet and leapt up, stepping into the sixth level of the Reincarnation Tower. At this point, Lu You had caught up with the top geniuses of the 10,000 races in the universe.

As Lu You continued to break through the geniuses and powerhouses of the 10,000 races in the universe, almost coincidentally, the news spread. No doubt about it, the entire universe was buzzing with it. The fourth shift was still adding more to this chapter, which was rewarded and added as chapter 103: Future Marshall Saint, 10 Realms Hidden Secrets.

It had been 11 days since the Reincarnation Tower opened its appearance, attracting the attention of almost the entire universe. Whether they were ordinary beings who didn't even have a realm or terrifying deities who had stepped into the 10th realm, they were all paying attention to this cosmic event. Even some of the war zones that had been fighting for years had suspended their killings and the two sides had tacitly withdrawn their troops to enjoy this rare piece. This and Lu You's previous life Olympic Games were somewhat similar, but of course, the scale and influence were more than 10,000 times, a billion times larger, between the major star fields of the universe. A group of top powerhouses talked and laughed while watching the competition of their juniors breaking through the one realm reincarnation Tower was only the beginning of this event, it's more than appropriate to say it's an appetizer.

The first realm, the very first realm, corresponded to the cultivation of skin and flesh, and it was very difficult for this realm to break out into exciting battles. Even if some races in the universe were blessed with great defense, attack, and speed right from birth, the strength that could be utilized was still quite limited until a certain session of the Reincarnation Tower. There is a brainy human kid chose to destroy the foundation to repair and then with the unique advantages successfully killed the top three and picked up a treasure for nothing. At that time, this outrageous and daring operation directly caused the shock of all the races in the universe. So, it could still be played like this, and so it was under the influence of this little human wit. The originally uneventful one realm reincarnation Tower directly became unprecedentedly intense. Now, not to say that all of those who broke into the Reincarnation Tower, at least the vast majority, 99.99% were foundation destruction rehabilitators. In this one realm reincarnation Tower, a true one realm was conversely a rare existence, and there are only a handful.

Amidst the first realm, there was no doubt about the existence of a true realm capable of overcoming such challenging circumstances. So, how formidable must this individual's innate talent be? Luu, for instance, treated The Reincarnation Tower as a speed pass game, reaching the sixth floor in just a few hours. He kept pace with the top geniuses of the 10,000 races. To perform like this was stunning and undeniably powerful. However, it was far from enough to excite the entire universe. Before Luu, several Heavenly Prides had displayed similar feats, but unlike them, Luu didn't destroy his foundation and retrain. He was genuinely in the first realm, a fact that left the 10,000 races of the universe, along with countless spectators, shocked and amazed. Could his future surpass that of a mere marshal emperor? Might there be a second Marshal Saint in the human race? This thought was horrifying enough.

In the midst of the icy starry sky, a solitary planet floated tangibly, devoid of stars or asteroids. Suddenly, the enormous planet opened its massive, singular eye, revealing a dark yellow, bizarre pupil. Anyone who glanced at it would instantly fall into insanity. This was the Star God Corsair, a great being from the Star God community. He gazed at the distant Reincarnation Tower, as if trying to see the intruder within.

Unknown to him, Luu Chang Sheng's son, a true first-realm Heavenly Pride and a potential future Marshal Saint, was inside. The Star God Corsair pondered if this individual, considered a true Heavenly Pride, could possibly achieve the tenth realm, even with a high natural talent or enlightenment. The tenth realm was not that simple, and with the human race's meager civilization, it was already a miraculous occurrence for a Lu Chang to appear. Unless Lu Ching was willing to fulfill his son's potential, one day, this genius among geniuses would gradually realize that his old man was the obstacle on the path to the tenth realm. The Star God Corsair couldn't help but wonder how Lu Chang Sheng would feel when he witnessed his son's performance.

The transition from the eighth to the ninth realm was more difficult than all the realms before it combined. The leap from the ninth to the tenth realm was not just about difficulty; it required proving an unprecedented doubt. This was challenging for almost all of the nine realms, but it was only the obvious difficulty. The true secret was known only to the powerful ones who had once broken through the tenth rank. Proving the doubt was only the first step. The second step required the help of civilization fire, and the third step also demanded an old God's corpse to complete the final ascension to the godly long stage and break into the Supreme 10 realms.

The human race had little civilization fire, enough only to produce one Marshal Saint. It was impossible for a second one to appear. The solution to have a second Marshal Saint appear again involved expanding the planetary territory, multiplying the race's population, and consuming other races' civilization fires to grow the race's own. This would allow for the appearance of a second tenth realm. This was the reason the 10,000 races of the universe constantly targeted the human race. A tenth realm still alive was far too powerful compared to their old gods. If they didn't restrict the human race and allowed a second Marshal Saint to appear, it would be the end of the line. Once the second Marshal Saint emerged, it would no longer be possible to restrain them, and soon, a third and fourth would follow. The old gods feared that they would drive the evil gods to extinction.

The Star God Corsair hoped that Lu Chang Sheng would continue ascending towards godhood. Once he became a Marshal God, he would no longer be a Marshal Saint, and his own self would gradually distort over time. At that point, the human race would no longer pose a threat, as it would no longer be possible for a new Marshal Saint to appear. In the meantime, Bayu Yya, the Marshal Saint's residence, was ecstatically cheering for her son's genius performance. Lu Chang Sheng was relatively more calm, but his eyes lit up in admiration. As expected, his son had surprised him. At just the first realm, he had begun to master inscriptions, with at least 10 inscriptions already mastered. Even though Lu You didn't display the inscriptions, the discerning Lu Changing could still see them. Bayu Yya was shocked when she heard this, questioning how a first-realm individual could master inscriptions. Lu Chang Sheng smiled, stating that as long as one was talented enough, anything was possible.

Yu Yao nodded, then realized, "No wonder he can be so relaxed and cozy. Breaking through to the sixth level in one breath, so it's because he's mastered the inscription. I have to say, brother, when youan taught me, you really did well. I don't even have that skill."
Lu Changxang smiled and said, "Could it be that this kid can really become a marshal Saint in the future?"
Yu Yao couldn't help but say, "It's hard and difficult, but not impossible."
Lu Changxang said, "So, of course, he knew about the hidden matters of the broken 10 realm. But so what?"
Chapter 104: Mission Progress

Luu had just arrived at the sixth floor when a monster directly pounced on him. This was the monster blocking the entrance. Many Heaven's Pride after breaking through to a new level would breathe a sigh of relief, only to be caught off guard by a sneak attack. A carelessness that was sent straight back. Quite a few Heaven's Pride had suffered this loss, which was why it was eliminated right off the bat. There were quite a few examples of this, and it could be a heartbreaking experience. However, Luu belonged to the later group and knowing this in advance, he naturally did not let his guard down. With a backhanded sword, he slaughtered the monster and continued on his way.
Just for a moment, he stepped into the safe zone. Not far away was a huge temple. It was bustling with activity inside. That's the rest area on the sixth floor. Luu did not hesitate and continued to walk forward. At the same time, a curtain of light appeared before his eyes. The text on it slowly emerged.
Name: Luu
Current Floors: Six
Current Rank: 19,702
Current Area: Safe Area
Duration of Stay: 23 hours and 59 minutes remaining
Number of Break-ins: Five

Once you fail a level, you will start all over again. So please adjust your form as best you can before continuing your adventure. After the rest time is over, if you do not leave the safe area, you will be automatically teleported to the dangerous area.
The light screen in front of him was somewhat similar to the system panel. Luu couldn't help but frown as some speculations arose in his heart. Could it be that his system is somehow related to this reincarnation Tower? I have to say, it's quite possible. The origin of this system is definitely not simple. Some of this could be seen from the rewards it gave.
Dowowo Embryo Pill
Boundary Breaking Pill
Dragon Tiger Gold Pill
Nine Revolution Soul Restoration Pill
Pichy Luck Suppression Stone
Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul Suppression Stone
And so on. These things favoring The Immortal side are out of place with the technological items of today's Star Wars era. Most likely, his system came from the last reincarnation era, even longer. It is said that this reincarnation Tower has gone through an unknown number of reincarnations. For those great existences that were Immortal and completely controlled the rules, things like time no longer had any meaning.
So, here's the question: whether it was Luu's system or this reincarnation Tower, what was their purpose? Just to pred Geniuses? Luu raised his head and glanced at the gorgeous sky above the reincarnation Tower. These answers perhaps one day he would know, but certainly not now. There was no point in thinking about it at the moment. Luu shook his head and threw these distractions out of his mind. He opened the system panel and glanced at the quest progress.
A breath of air from the first layer rushed to the sixth layer, directly catching up with the footsteps of the top Geniuses of the upper 10,00 Clans. This kind of stunning performance must have caused quite a stir. That was Luu's purpose. Since you want to complete the system's Mainline task, you can't hide your clumsiness, and even more so, you can't keep a low profile. You have to crush and sweep once you come up and show a real Heavenly Pride posture. The more stunning the better, the more invincible the better. Not only did he want the 10,000 races of the universe to be shocked, but he also wanted to give them chills and make them remember his name deeply. In this way, it was possible to complete the main quest and obtain the Taiu Defaced Dhap Pill.
I also wonder, did he just cause enough of a stir with his breakthrough performance? Will it get the job done? He opened the quest progress to take a look at it, and it read:
Current Alien Prestige Value: 270 million points.
Luu raised his eyebrows, his heart was inevitably a little surprised. How come it was only this much? 270 million reputation points seemed like a lot, but when placed in the scope of the entire universe, it was nothing at all. That's too little.
To know, Luu's previous human Prestige Quest was just a New Year's congratulations on TV, and it was completed. Now, this Fay Prestige Quest, it's actually this hard. He broke through to the sixth floor in one breath, such a stunning performance, and all he had was this reputation value. How was it calculated?
Luu frowned and flipped out the quest introduction to look at it again. As the son of the Marshal Saint, your reputation cannot be limited within the human race alone but more so, you must make the thousands of foreign races hear your name and make them tremble with fear. Please go to the battlefield to fight. Venture deep into the secret realm. Shock thousands of foreigners with your heavenly talent and gain 1 billion points of reputation among their communities.
This reincarnation Tower also counts as a secret realm. It should be correct. Otherwise, the quest progress wouldn't have increased. The reason it's only increased so much might be because

I am too small, and the means at my disposal are not powerful enough. After all, I am only in the first realm. Even if one performs exceptionally well and causes a stir, it is still difficult to make people tremble, let alone deter thousands of foreign races. The description of this mission is straightforward: "Battle in the Sands, break into the secret realm, and directly kill a bloody path, thus shocking the 10,000 Clans." Now that I have arrived at The Reincarnation Tower to make a break for it, I can only say that it is merely taking advantage of the situation. Even if it causes a certain stir, it is hard to gain much reputation value. A breath of air gained 270 million reputation value, which is not a small amount. As long as we kill our way to the top of the leaderboards, there is still hope of completing this quest. Thinking this way, Luu approached the hall and immediately heard the voices and quarrels inside. Inside the temple, many foreign races gathered, discussing and laughing. There were also a few humanoids sitting in the corner, resting and not daring to make a sound. However, even so, they were still targeted by a few foreigners. These were tall apes with extremely long arms, almost hanging down to the ground. They looked down at these humans and showed their teeth. "When has there been a place for your human race here? Get the hell out of here!" When those few people heard this, their faces changed, and the leader gritted his teeth and said, "This is a public area. Anyone can rest here. Don't bully people too much." The tall ape couldn't help but grin from ear to ear when he heard this. "So what if I bully you? Your human race is the Public Enemy of all Races. I told you guys to get out and not to be an eyesore. You honestly listened. Unless you guys don't want to go through the sixth floor." When these words came out, the faces of several human geniuses turned ugly. The genius at the head of the human race still wanted to argue, but behind him, someone immediately pulled him. "There's no need to argue with this guy. Go outside to rest is the same." Since he had come to The Reincarnation Tower, it was still important to break through the barrier. If he was targeted by these foreign races and stumbled while breaking through the barrier, it would be difficult. Such things were not uncommon, and many human geniuses were eliminated early just because of the targeting of these foreign races. Although their own lack of strength was one aspect, without the targeting of these foreign races, the human race's results should have been a little better. People have to bow down under the roof; it can't be helped. Just as these few human geniuses got up, a small figure walked into the midst of this tall hall. Chapter 105: It's all about being arrogant and bossy. When Luu stepped into the hall, many Fay subconsciously looked over with just a glance. This Fay froze a little doll from the human race, and it seems a bit familiar. Although the news of Lu you breaking through from the first to the sixth floor and one breath had caused the 10,000 races of the universe to be a buzz with excitement, it was impossible to receive news from the outside world while breaking through The Reincarnation Tower. So, these geniuses of the alien races were not aware of Luu's feet for the time being. There were quite a few humanoids who had broken through to the sixth floor, and although Luu was a little smaller, they didn't feel that Luu was anything special. Still, at this time, some of the Fay recognized him. "I remember, I told you why he looked so familiar. Who told you about it? He's Luu, Luu, the son of the Marshall Saint, the Crown Prince of the human race. Oh, so that's him? Wasn't it said that the Marshall Saint's only son, an arrogant and bossy fellow, was even able to break through to the sixth floor? Obviously, the rumors aren't that believable. And well, he's the only son of a Marshall Saint, so how can it be that simple? A group of Fay were discussing it, and a few of the apes that drove the humans away cast their eyes over the leader of the apes and monkeys, Kik. Kik sneered and spoke, "This is no place for your human race. All of you get out of here!" When those few humanoids who had also seen Luu froze for a moment, obviously not expecting Luu to be able to break in here, when they heard the apes' words, they hesitated for a moment but still stood out and walked up to Luu's body. The human genius at the head looked up and said, "Have you ever heard of a saying of our human race? What's the word? Kick." The ape leader, a human genius, spoke seriously, "If you really want to be so aggressive, even if we don't break through the barrier, we'll drag a few of your ape God Clan fellows down with us." When these few apes heard this, they were stunned, completely not expecting these few cowardly humanoids to dare to let out such harsh words to them. It's still a rarity. A few apes quickly reacted, "This kid behind them, I'm afraid his status is not generally honorable, that's why they are protecting him." After hearing the discussion behind him, the leader ape immediately understood the reason. "The Crown Prince..."

Son of the Marshall Saint, no wonder you dare to speak such things. You're just showing your loyalty and being a lapdog. K nodded and said, "So," then suddenly his eyes widened. "Only this makes things even more interesting."

Places, gentlemen," AP pointed condescendingly at Luu with a cold smile. "All of you listen up. The Crown Prince of the human race has barged in. Is there anyone interested? Is there anyone whose heart is moved? This is the finest of the finest of the finest of the finest of the finest of the finest of the finest of the finest!" He he he he, a shrill, playful laugh emphasized AP Kiker's immense smugness.

As expected, the moment these words came out, almost all the foreign races within the vast hall cast their gazes upon the several human geniuses who stood in front of Luu. The faces of these geniuses grew increasingly ugly as they heard these words, and it was clear that the situation was moving in a very serious direction. They hadn't realized at all that their good intentions had made things worse. What to do about this? With guilt in their eyes, they subconsciously glanced at Luu, only hoping that he wouldn't complain or blame them.

However, to the surprise of several people, a hint of delight flashed through Luu's gaze. "Wait, elated, huh? I think it's correct, isn't it?" Luu slowly raised his head, glanced at the great ape not far away, and then looked at the group of foreign geniuses. He couldn't help but feel rather sleepy. "To send a pillow... these foreigners are also too thoughtful. This is to know that their own progress on the task is still lacking, so they hurry to rush up and send it. Can't laugh, definitely don't laugh out loud otherwise it's not good to scare these guys away."

After breaking through from the first layer to the sixth layer, Luu already had a rough idea of his strength at this stage. At least in the top 20, if not the top 10. The current topmost Heavenly Prides had already broken through to the seventh floor. Those who stayed on the sixth level were mostly in the hundreds to tens of thousands. To put it bluntly, it's a bunch of rookies. Only slightly more powerful rookies. But at this point, it didn't seem right not to respond.

Luu thought for a moment and spoke disdainfully, "Where did that monkey come from? It's really noisy. Get the hell out of my way."

The ape had thought that after he had spoken those words, he would scare this human Prince Master into trembling. Who knew that he was not the slightest bit intimidated. At the moment, he was even open to reprimand. Kik was frozen. "Is this little guy... do not know what this means?"

Seeing that the monkey was dumbfounded, Luu continued in a light, condescending, and disdainful tone, "Even you deserve to snipe me? Do you guys deserve to target me? I am the son of the Marshall Saint. What is your status? What is my status? Don't even think about it. Why don't you get out of my way?"

Arrogant and bossy, it's all about arrogance. Kik's eyes widened, anger burning in his eyes, and he couldn't help but make a move. However, this is a safe area, and once you do it, it means you're out. That's too big a price to pay. Kik forced back his anger, sneered, and actually got out of the way. Anyway, his plan had succeeded, and the many foreign races within the Great Hall had their eyes on this Luu. When he started to break into the sixth floor, he would have his regrets.

Luu walked to a secluded location and directly began to rest. The few human geniuses beside him, feeling the gazes of countless foreign geniuses, had their scalps tingling. For a while, they gritted their teeth and still followed behind Luu. In any case, Luu had taken a stand like this, so could they still back down?

The surrounding geniuses of the foreign races stared coldly at Luu's side, constantly whispering. The originally noisy Hall gradually became extraordinarily quiet, like the calm before the storm. Luu, however, didn't take them to heart and instead glanced at these few human geniuses. "What are your names?" Luu asked.

"Yu Guang, Ferris, Buer, Child, Yu Chi," the four men spoke up.

Luu nodded, memorizing their names, and casually said, "Rest well, and when you break through the sixth level later, follow me. And if I can, I will shelter you for a moment or two."

The four people were stunned for a moment when they heard this and couldn't help but open their mouths. The difficulty of the sixth layer is to break through. Are the Phoenix and lynchpin of the generation? There is still room to shelter others? This is even more a handful. At this moment, Luu even said that he would shelter them. This is really too confident. Call him ignorant. He had at least broken into the sixth floor. He should have known the difficulty of this Reincarnation Tower. So why could he still say such things? Could it be that Luu really has the strength to shelter them?

Here is the revised text with improved English:

Luu was even more powerful than they were, both in terms of volume and completeness. He had only mastered 13 inscriptions, but the gap was still there. He really couldn't be arrogant and think that he had all the answers. These gaps could be narrowed through constant cultivation, of course, but Luu was the one who lacked the time to cultivate. Inside the temple, the many foreign races watched Luu cultivate and were all a little surprised. "What's he supposed to be doing?" some of the foreign gods wondered. "Is this a way to break the rules, staying up all night and then getting teleported to a dangerous area?" They couldn't fathom Luu's intentions. 

No one knew where Luu's arrogant and domineering backbone had come from. "This is The Reincarnation Tower," one of the foreigners sneered. "Even if your old man was a Marquis Saint, he still couldn't get in. And what's more, your human race is Public Enemy Number One. Your identity as the son of a human Marquis Saint won't impress us at all. It will only make us more excited, ah!"

"Maybe you're just used to being arrogant and bossy," another foreign god suggested. "This moment could already be the start of a major regret, but whatever you think, this prey in your sights will never be allowed to escape, not with the passage of time." 

Luu slowly opened his eyes, and a strange light flickered in his pupils, which no one noticed. That was the 14th inscription, one that enhanced his dynamic vision and gave him extraordinary insight, which could be crucial in the middle of a battle. With the increase of this inscription, Luu's combat power went up a notch. The mastery of this inscription put Luu in a good mood. 

"After all, the only way to grow quickly is to keep fighting," he thought to himself. Luu had broken through from the first layer to the sixth layer in a single breath, and although it was a stretch, it was a constant battle. When he cultivated, he thoroughly digested these epiphanies and accumulated the benefits of his previous cultivation, leading to the mastery of his new inscription. 

With the new inscription mastered, the next battle would be even better. "It's time to go," Luu said to the few human geniuses around him. The four human geniuses beside him were all stunned, then nodded, and when they stood up and left the hall, Luu took a step out of the safe area, followed by hundreds of other alien geniuses. Behind them, the Great Hall disappeared, and a new prompt appeared before Luu's eyes: "You have entered the Danger Zone on the sixth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. Please choose any direction and break through all the way to the end to reach the seventh floor. There are no restrictions here. You can attack any target at will."

Luu turned back to look at them, his smile rising at the corner of his mouth.  "How come it's only this much?" some of the human geniuses asked, "What do you mean only this much? There are so many foreign geniuses in the hall just now." "Is that any less?" Meanwhile, the ape god's clan looked left and right and asked with a cold smile. "Which one of you will make the first move?" Many of the surrounding foreign gods remained unmoved, as if they hadn't heard it. Seeing how cautious they were, Luu couldn't help but let out a cold snort and glanced at the three tall apes beside him. Let's go, we still have to hunt our prey with the Four Diamonds, yes, let's go. A bunch of goons! One ape couldn't help but curse at this moment. Luu had already drawn his long sword, not hiding the fury in his pupils at all, as if a devil had descended upon the world, making people's hearts palpitate for a while. This sudden change caused the several human geniuses next to him to freeze for a moment. "What are you going to do?" one of them asked, "You're suggesting we just kill them all." "In a quick battle," Luu replied. 

Hearing these dry words, several human geniuses were dumfounded, still unable to comprehend the meaning of Luu's words. Still, the ape god's clan had already rushed over, roaring as he attacked, his pair of dark red pupils staring at Luu to death. Facing these big guys, Luu slowly raised the long sword in his hand. The sword was like an abyss; the sword intent surged wildly, the sword chi rampant, and the fury uncontrolled. This move was clearly "Extreme Demon Punishment". When this move was first used in the Tower of Trials, it wasn't perfect and its power was lacking, but now this move had been perfectly mastered, without a single flaw.

Here is the text with significant improvements in English:

Directly targeted his head with precision, the air around him exploded in a flurry of energy projectiles, causing four Great VDRA of the Ape God Clan to topple to the ground almost instantly. Not only were the several AP God race experts standing next to him similarly ill-equipped, but in an instant, they too were swiftly killed, their bodies splattered with holes and their eyes frozen in a lifeless stare. The four Geniuses of the ape God race who had responded with haste had already succumbed to their wounds at Luu's feet. Luu, however, remained expressionless, as if this was all part of an inevitable course of events.

He grasped the Rapier in his hand and continued on his way, leaving the stunned crowd in his wake. "Ha! What manner of attack is this?" Hauh! "The crowd of Geniuses who followed in his wake saw the scene, their hearts boiling with shock, their faces set in a mixture of awe and fear. None of them had expected that Luu would dispatch all four of the Ape God's greatest warriors with a single swing of his sword. In the end, every single one was killed, without exception.

"These top Geniuses of the 10,000 races were all the pride of their respective Clans," a stunned spectator muttered. "And to be killed by Luu's sword... it's simply too much. That guy's got the power of the top 50 rankings, no, it's worse than that. He's invincible."

Just as the Foreign Geniuses were rejoicing secretly, Luu began walking towards them, his sword at the ready. Their faces turned white, their scalps numb with fear. "What does he want?" one of them whispered. "Is he out of his mind?" Luu, however, seemed oblivious to their concerns. He was far too focused on his next move.

"None of us are going to go after you," one of the Foreign Geniuses surrendered nervously. "It's just not worth it." Luu watched them retreat, his expression unreadable. He had been expecting them all along.

At this point, a Foreign Genius opened his mouth and questioned, "Wait a minute, what do you want, Luu?" Luu glanced at him briefly, his gaze even and detached. "Don't be ridiculous," he replied. "It's obvious what I'm trying to do. And as for you, you people... you only came to try to break through my Barrier after all, knowing full well that I wouldn't hesitate to kill anyone who dared to interfere with my quest."

Another Foreign Genius laughed at Luu's words. "No matter how strong you are, you're still just one person, Luu. We are a collective force, and if we joined together, I imagine you'd be hard-pressed to defeat us."

But Luu merely laughed out loud, his eyes burning with an unyielding intensity. "When?" he asked sarcastically. "When are you going to take a step back? Don't bother, it's not going to be necessary."

In that moment, Luu seemed to acknowledge that the stakes were already higher than anyone could have imagined. The outcome was far from certain, and both sides were willing to weigh their options carefully. Luu's words, however, also made it clear that he had absolutely no intention of backing down.

"This guy is crazy, what kind of Madman is he?" one of the Foreign Geniuses breathed. "It's simply unbelievable."

As the scene unfolded, the human community's reactions ranged from shock to outrage. "Kill, Kill, out with the might of my human race!" some spectators hissed in excitement. The foreign races, unfortunately, had foolishly underestimated Luu's capabilities, and they now realized they had made a grave mistake.

And so, the humans. Having learned that their pride had been crushed by Luu's sword, the focus shifted to bearing the price that the foreign races would have to pay. Luu, having mastered the art of the live broadcasts from the Tower of Reincarnation, had won the game with a crushing display of power.

This moment marked the turning point, as the natural consequences of the actions of both sides were starting to escalate. If the foreign races had dared to target Luu and his human kind, he was not going to hesitate to retaliate.

The community was holding its breath, watching as Luu's strength revealed itself to the world, but it wouldn't push him over the edge. The universe itself was waiting with bated breath for the continuation of this fierce and intense battle.

Some of the strongest members from the Fay race, recognizing the power of the sword, believed it to be the Emperor Jaia's sword. As they watched him perform the po exorcism, it became clear that this was indeed the move associated with that sword. This move is unique to the first realm, and the character used it flawlessly. An ordinary individual from the first realm would never be able to master this move perfectly. To do so, one must master at least ten inscriptions, and even then, it's an arduous task due to the sword's extraordinary requirements.

This little fellow is almost invincible in his realm, and in the entire reincarnation Tower, there are only a handful who can defeat him. His natural talent and enlightenment are heaven-defying, making him a formidable opponent.

The second sword, Emperor I'm afraid, is the final blow for the human race. With the threat of Fish Death looming, humans may not produce a sword Saint of the exaggerated sixth level. However, the human in question showed no fear and raised his long sword once again. The sword momentum quickly coalesced, and the sword intent tumbled and surged wildly. The fury was like a mountain or a sea.

After killing the four Great VRA of the ape God Clan, Luu's momentum of the demon execution sword was even more formidable. The foreign Geniuses were filled with shock and anger, realizing that Luu didn't consider them a threat. They decided to join forces to kill him. However, their unity was short-lived. One question was enough to tear them apart, and with a foreigner intending to run away, the formation scattered instantly, turning into a group of rabble.

Luu laughed indulgently and without hesitation, he swung his sword and chopped again. The sword light turned into a raging storm, instantly piercing through a dozen or so alien Geniuses. One by one, they desperately resisted but still couldn't resist the rolling sword light. When all the Geniuses of the foreign races saw this scene, one by one, their scalps went numb, and their bodies trembled. This move was even more terrifying than beheading the four Great VRA of the AP God Clan.

Luu did not hesitate and once again raised the long sword in his hand. The fury condensed quickly, almost visible to the naked eye. His eyes were a little red at this moment, as if he had truly become a demon child. This was the special effect of the extreme demon Punisher, which could accumulate blood devouring Chi when used continuously. Utilizing the death of the opponent to continuously enhance the power of the sword, Luu was suppressing evil with evil and punishing the Devil with the Devil.

Fierce and evil, invincible in the world, at this moment, when these foreign Geniuses saw Luu lifting his sword again, each one of them died. The last second was still filled with harsh words, directly into fish and birds dispersed, escaping in all directions. Chapter 108: Sword Beheading the 10,000 Races - Heavenly Pride. Four or 500 foreign races joined together like a dark cloud pressing down on the realm, raging. When the several human Geniuses of YuYu Guang Fong saw that scene, their hearts stopped beating. With so many foreign Geniuses joining forces, it was feared that no single Heavenly pride in the entire reincarnation Tower would be able to match them, as was the Tower of Trials.

Luu lifted his arm and waved his hand, leading 5 to 600 people to block the God and Buddha. However, no one could have imagined that in just a twinkling of an eye, those four to 500 foreigners instantly scattered. The birds and fishes let alone joining forces, there wasn't even decent resistance. It's simply a rabble. Obviously, harsh words were put out, but one ran away faster than the other. At the moment, the thoughts of these foreign Geniuses were simple. They might not be as fast as Luu, but as long as they ran faster than the other Geniuses, as long as there are padded backs, then it won't be you who gets hurt.

Luu, however, had no intention of letting them go and directly chased after them to kill them. A little doll chasing after the Heavenly Pride of the major Clans to kill them, this image was simply unimaginable.

Not too beautiful, it's incredibly impactful. Not far behind, when Yu Yuan's few human geniuses witnessed this scene, their jaws dropped in shock. The moment this astonishing footage was relayed, the countless spectators of the human community were exhilarated. Initially, there were still some spectators who worried that it would be disastrous if these foreign races joined forces and scaled the wall. Who knew that these foreigners were only arrogant with their words, but in reality, they were all weaker than one another in the face of Luu's onslaught? They were obviously vast in number, but they didn't even put up a decent resistance – it's ludicrous.

Meanwhile, among the major communities of the universe, silence prevailed. The spectators of the various races, upon seeing this image, all had furrowed brows and gloomy complexions. No one had expected that in the face of Luu's coercion, many of the foreign races' celestial pride had wimped out like this – shame on them, it's so humiliating. However, there was also some understanding from the Fay audience. The various races, already at odds and hating each other, would have to give up their preconceptions, trust each other, and unite together to fight against the outside world. What a joke – it's not simple at all. It's not something you can say in a few words and expect to be successful. So, routing at this moment is almost a predictable scenario. It was just that being chased and killed by a little doll of the human race was too humiliating, making it a bit unacceptable for them.

After chasing and killing nearly a hundred foreign tribesmen's celestial pride one after another, Luu stopped. There was no way to catch up – these guys were too far away and too spread out to catch up for a while. Moreover, on this sixth floor, there were many monsters roaming around, which made it even more difficult to pursue them. They could only count themselves lucky and let them off the hook for now. Luu thought like this and carried his sword back to its original place on his body. There were several inscriptions that constantly bloomed with a shimmering light. Inscriptions are a good thing and can serve a variety of purposes, enhancing strength in all directions. The few inscriptions on his body at the moment, the effects were probably restoring the power of chi and blood, increasing movement speed, enhancing control, increasing the power of his moves, etc. The increase of a single inscription is limited, so one must keep comprehending and mastering more inscriptions. In addition, a way has to be found to tie the inscriptions together. Once successful, the increase effect of the inscription will undergo a metamorphosis – it's like going from a single text to a line of text, which naturally means something completely different. 1+1 is greater than two, but the difficulty of this is self-evident. This is not a simple permutation – it's not just a matter of taking those inscriptions, finding the right order, and putting them together. Rather, it requires a renewed enlightenment and a blended understanding. This was slightly difficult for Luu at this stage. He suspected that there might be such an existence among the top 10 ranked powerhouses. Luu shook his head slightly, no longer thinking about it.

As he glanced at the quest progress, the current alien pride value was 530 million points. Sure enough, the party had managed to make the progress of the mission increased by a lot with this killing. He had intentionally fished in the safe zone earlier for this very thing – cool. When Luu returned to his original position, the gazes of Yu Guang's few people looking at him could be described as extremely complicated. There was surprise, respect, awe, and envy in these eyes. These few human geniuses had completely never expected that Luu's natural talent could be terrifying to this extent. This can no longer be described as a simple demon – it's simply anticlimactic. Luu, however, ignored the complicated feelings of these people as he spoke, "Trouble solved. Next, I will start to break through the sixth level. You guys follow me. I don't know how much I can shelter you. You guys follow – you can't just think about relying on me. You have to work on yourselves. Luu is not a saintly mother. If it was only in passing, then it would be fine to shelter them a little, being of the same human race. But if it affected his own ability to break through, of course, he wouldn't die trying to save face and he would have to babysit these people as well."

YuYu Guang's few people naturally knew this and quickly nodded their heads to show that they understood. It was already a great favor for Luu to step in and shelter him a little. How dare they ask for too much? The sixth level was simple to break. After leaving the safe area, head in any direction and kill your way to the end, which would lead to the seventh level. This journey was not difficult for Luu. The difficulty of the monsters was indeed quite a bit more powerful than the fifth floor, but it's only a slight hassle. A little time will fix it. Two hours later, he managed to make it to the end of the sixth floor. Behind Luu, the four people from before were now left with only one – Yu Guang. He was the strongest one among those four, relying on his own strength as well as Luu's occasional shelter to successfully break into this place. However, at the moment, he was in a bad state, with one arm broken and wounds all over his body. Even in such a sorry state, there was an undisguised look of joy on his face.

The cost is indeed significant, but as long as one can break through to the seventh layer, it would all be worth it. If Luu was the first of the human race to reach the seventh floor, then he was the second. It's a great feeling to have this breakthrough.

Liu glanced back at YuYu Guang and signaled him to follow. Luu's feet lightly stepped on the ground and directly left the sixth floor. Yu yuguang nodded excitedly and hurriedly followed. However, something unexpected happened. YuYu Guang was unable to travel to the seventh floor, despite having clearly broken in. He hit the wall as the seventh level denied him access. YuYu Guang's eyes widened as he watched Luu's figure disappear. Luu had already left the sixth floor.

Once again, the one realm reincarnation Tower leaderboards were refreshed, and Luu's name had clearly appeared at the top of the reincarnation Tower rankings.

To Luu's surprise, there were no gatekeeper monsters on the seventh floor. He came to a large hall, a secure area. The place was very large, but there were only a handful of foreign races resting. At the same time, a light curtain appeared in front of his eyes, and lines of text were slowly displayed.

Name: Luu
Race: Human
Current floor: Seven
Floors remaining: Six
Current area: Safe area
Duration of stay: 6 days, 23 hours, and 59 minutes remaining
Number of break-ins: Six
300 names already

Luu nodded, and the moment he appeared, he also attracted the attention of several foreign races. However, they just took a glance at Luu and withdrew their gazes, not in the mood to meddle. They were all very proud of themselves, with absolute confidence in their own strength. They rarely used underhanded means to target their competitors. Those who were able to break through to the seventh floor were true super geniuses.

Luu glanced back but realized that YuYu Guang did not appear. Luu shook his head and began to look around the entire hall. It was similar to the rest of the halls on the sixth floor but with some differences, like more statues or rather idols. A statue of a God was positioned to the left and right of the main hall. The face of the idol had become blurred, but the Majesty was still there, making people unconsciously feel a sense of awe in their hearts.

These many idols were arching over a huge square slab of stone. The stone slab was 100 ft tall, with tiny f-sized characters engraved on it. Luu was shocked by the huge stone slab after just one look. He realized why the stable time for the seventh level was seven whole days. Normally, 24 hours was more than enough time to rest, and any more was unnecessary. But this seventh level of safety was obviously not just for resting.

Luu, from the first layer of the Reincarnation Tower, in one breath, broke through to the sixth layer. This level broke through even if he pushed across and crushed again, he did not get a tiny bit of reward. He also thought for a while that it was because this reincarnation Tower was too petty and that was why it didn't give rewards. He didn't realize that the rewards weren't absent; they just weren't given upfront until the seventh floor.

Luu carefully looked at this huge stone slab. The tiny words on it were more than a billion of them. It was actually an inscription. Luu was already quite proud of himself after mastering only 14 inscriptions so far. At this moment, seeing the billions of inscriptions on this stone plate, the shock in his heart was truly impossible to describe in words. No wonder those foreigners were unwilling to look at themselves more than once; it turns out that they were all attending to this Stone tablet.

Luu pressed down his excitement and hurriedly sat down on the ground and began his Enlightenment cultivation because he was in a safe area. The tue Immortal cells that were originally dormant within Luu's body were slowly operating at this moment. After just three hours, Luu had mastered an inscription. This speed was more than a bit faster than before. Luu's eyes lit up, and at the same time, he couldn't help but think that those Heavens Pride demons who had come here earlier than himself, they were still here, attending to this stone tablet, trying to master the inscriptions on it.

Amidst fears that his progress rate would escalate rather than decrease, initially, Luu anticipated he could at least enter the top 20 or even the top 10 based on his strength. However, now it seemed challenging to break into the top 50. Still, he had ample time to continue enlightening himself and growing stronger. As each day passed, the number of Celestial Prides arriving on the seventh floor increased. They found little reference material on the stone tablets, as they were all rebuilding their foundations and recultivating. Their Dharma bodies had already coalesced, and the inscriptions had been fixed. Becoming stronger couldn't be achieved overnight, so these Heavenly Prides rested and practiced for a while before leaving the safe area to break into the seventh floor.

This led to Luu's ranking constantly slipping, starting from 295th and gradually moving to the 500th, then the end of the 1,000th place. Outside, when Luu opened his eyes again, his ranking had dropped to 1,241. Due to the secure area on the seventh floor, it was impossible to broadcast live, leaving all human race spectators unaware of Luu's actions and the reason for his prolonged stall.

These viewers initially expected Luu to continue soaring, given that he brought a few dragons with him and they had all killed their way into the seventh floor. This level of strength was truly terrifying, and as long as Luu kept pushing forward, he could undoubtedly break into the top 100, top 50, or even the top 10. Killing his way to the forefront of the 10,000 Heaven's Pride clans would shake the entire universe. However, no one knew what Luu was doing or why he had suddenly stalled. Many human spectators felt disappointed and wondered why Luu had stopped.

It had been five or six days since his last movement, and his ranking had slipped significantly. Some viewers speculated that Luu might have been injured on the sixth floor. Despite the stretch, people still held hope and pressure on the three-year-old Luu, as his many performances had made him the undisputed number one of the human race. His power had conquered almost all spectators, who no longer saw him as a child but as a hero of the human race.

Obviously, this hero who could break into the top rankings of the Reincarnation Tower had stopped, causing anxiety and anger among the viewers. If Luu wasn't the son of Marshall Saints, many might have cursed out of frustration. Meanwhile, the 10,000 races of the universe were delighted to see Luu's ranking slip as they watched foreign races surpass him.

In the meantime, the previous day's astonishing performance and unconventional behavior from Luu had marked him as a genius among the 10,000 races. They saw him as a favorite they couldn't do anything about. This was akin to a jungle, where a small kid who could break through to the seventh floor was already impressive. On the human side, they still counted on him, laughing at the overly optimistic expectations.

Some speculated that Luu's previous performance was so amazing because he used a secret method. Nine times out of ten, that was the case. If not, why hadn't he gone to break in for a long time? Now, it seemed the secret method had backfired, and the human side was eager to see Luu face the consequences.

The latest news revealed that Luu hadn't left the safe area of the seventh floor yet and continued resting. This led to ridicule from the outside world, with voices of verbal abuse, questions, and pressure. For a moment, all sorts of comments bombarded Luu's virtual presence. However, he remained unfazed and continued his cultivation.

Luu knew there would be a significant number of voices from the outside world, given his past performances. Hearing closed-door cultivation, he understood that the human community mostly saw him as a hope, but his sudden disappearance caused anxiety. However, Luu wouldn't change his plans because of external pressures. Forcing his way through the gate for a short-term ranking would be detrimental if it meant losing the opportunity to cultivate. Unlike other foreign geniuses, Luu's most significant shortcoming was the lack of time to cultivate. Therefore, even if the noise outside was deafening, Luu remained unmoved, unable to hear it anyway. He continued to focus on cultivation and practice, determined to strengthen himself.

Meanwhile, Hong Xiao Jun finally broke through the sixth floor and arrived at the seventh floor.

Quickly looking around, he subconsciously breathed a sigh of relief as he realized that there were no monsters blocking the passage. Soon, he spotted Luu's figure in a corner. If you don't look hard enough, you can't really find it these days. There was simply not too much news about Luu. Even Hong Xiao Jun was curious as to what had happened to make Luu stagnate at the seventh floor. Hong Xiao Jun rushed over after spotting Luu. Noticing Hong Xuan's approach, Luu slowly opened his eyes and glanced at him.
"What kind of eyes are those?" It was like looking straight into an abyss, causing one's heart to throb and inexplicably tense up.
Hong Xiao Jun breathed a sigh of relief. "Your footsteps feel a little incredible. You're actually scared." Obviously, as these days passed, Lou, you became stronger. So, it's practicing here that's a lot of patience." Hong Xiao Jun sighed in admiration in his heart, then spoke.
"These days that you've been cultivating here, there's a big commotion outside. You know, I can probably guess some of it."
Luu nodded.
"How many places can you probably break into now?" Hong Xiao Jun asked with some curiosity.
"At least the top 10," Luu said slowly.
These days of cultivation, Luu had already mastered 42 inscriptions. His strength once again became much stronger. The only pity was that he had no way to string the inscriptions together. Otherwise, not to mention the top 10, even the first, there is a sure way to fight for it.
"Then, when do you plan to break in?" Hong Xiao Jun couldn't help but ask.
"Wait for another day," Luu glanced at the time. There were still 24 hours left before he left the safe zone. Despite the fact that he had already had enough Improvement these last 24 hours were still not to be missed, and he had to continue practicing in order to do so.
"Okay," Hong Xiao Jun nodded.
Anyway, so many days had come and gone. It wasn't bad for a while.
"Has any foreign race's Heavenly Pride broken through to the eighth floor now?" Luu asked with some curiosity.
Before Luu's seclusion, no one had been able to break through to the eighth floor. I don't know if any Heavenly Pride can break through to the eighth floor after these days have passed. As far as I know, not yet," Hong Xao Jun shook his head.
"So difficult," Luu was a bit surprised. It's very difficult. All the previous reincarnation towers, those who could break into the eighth floor were originally just a handful, and it's only normal that no one can break into the eighth floor for the time being.
"Now, Hong XA Jun explained.
"Okay," Luu nodded. In fact, he probably understands all of this. I just didn't expect that no one had broken into the eighth floor in such a long time.
"Then, wouldn't the ninth floor be even more hopeless?" Luu asked.
"You wanted to check out the scenery of the ninth floor. Who would have thought it's surprisingly difficult to be like this?" Speaking of which, back then, his old man broke through to the ninth floor of the nine Realms reincarnation Tower before being thwarted. This kind of natural talent, when it is really outrageous to the extreme, is more Fierce than if he was hung up.
Originally, mastering 42 inscriptions, Luu was already quite confident. But now, that he looks at it, it's still a lot worse than his own old man. He wasn't even sure of anything when he broke through to the eighth floor. Now, let alone the ninth floor.
"Luu, you let out a deep breath. Keep practicing." Seeing Luu continue to cultivate, Hong Xiao Jun did not disturb him anymore. He turned his head to look at the huge stone slab and was also stunned. Instantly understanding the reason why Luu had progressed so quickly, it was only that this one inscription was placed here, and it was not an easy thing to comprehend.
Hong Xiao Jun also sat down on his knees and began to rest and cultivate. Time passes by. These last 24 hours passed quickly. Luu had mastered three more inscriptions, making it 45 inscriptions. It's just a shame that Luu tried to string the inscriptions together again and still failed. This is much harder than simply mastering inscriptions. Sure, even so, these seven days of cultivation still resulted in terrifying progress.
Mastering 45 inscriptions, I wonder where I can break in now. How many places can I kill? Luu raised his head and glanced at the huge stone monument with some reluctance. Normally, an ordinary Dharma body was inscribed with 36 inscriptions, and a more powerful Dharma body was only inscribed with 81 inscriptions. The top Geniuses only inscribed 199 inscriptions. Theoretically, the upper limit of inscriptions was here, and at this stage, it would be difficult to continue comprehending them. But the inscriptions on this Stone tablet were in the hundreds of billions. The disparity in numbers is truly shocking, baffling. Just what kind of existence had sealed so many inscriptions? Even the 10th realm can't do it. Right, the secret behind this Wheeling Tower is fascinating. Luu shook his head, no longer thinking about it, and turned around to leave the safe area on the seventh floor.
After practicing for so long, his ranking had dropped from 295 in the beginning to one 21 now. It's time to make a good run at the roster. Set a small goal. Make it into the top 10.
Chapter 111: Killing the Top 10, Still Sprinting

Blue Star Central Plaza, millions of people have gathered here in the center of the square. There were four huge screens that were broadcasting the Battle of The Reincarnation Tower. One by one, the wonderful images were continuously edited and played out. Watching the crowds, their blood boiled, unable to resist raising their arms as if they were participating in the battle themselves.
In the blink of an eye, Luu had already made it into the top 10. His name was now displayed on the huge screen. The audience cheered loudly, their excitement reaching new heights.
"Luu, you're amazing!" Hong Xiao Jun exclaimed, his eyes filled with admiration.
"It's not over yet," Luu replied calmly, his gaze fixed on the screen.
As the battle continued, Luu's ranking continued to rise. He had now surpassed the top 10 and was closing in on the top 5. The audience was in awe, their eyes glued to the screen.
"Luu, you're unstoppable!" Hong Xiao Jun exclaimed, his voice filled with disbelief.
"I'm not done yet," Luu replied, his expression determined.
Finally, Luu reached the top 3. The audience held their breath, their eyes wide with anticipation. Luu's name was now displayed alongside the other two top contenders.
"Luu, you're going to win this!" Hong Xiao Jun exclaimed, his voice filled with confidence.
"We'll see," Luu replied, his gaze fixed on the screen.
As the final moments of the battle approached, Luu's ranking continued to rise. He had now surpassed the top 2 and was closing in on the top spot. The audience was on the edge of their seats, their eyes glued to the screen.
"Luu, you're going to be the champion!" Hong Xiao Jun exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement.
"I'm not done yet," Luu replied, his expression determined.
Finally, the moment of truth arrived. Luu had surpassed the top contender and was now the undisputed champion of the Reincarnation Tower Battle. The audience erupted into cheers, their excitement reaching a fever pitch.
"Luu, you did it!" Hong Xiao Jun exclaimed, his voice filled with joy.
"Thank you for your support," Luu replied, his expression calm and collected.
As the crowd dispersed, Luu and Hong Xiao Jun walked away from the Central Plaza, their hearts filled with a sense of accomplishment.
"Luu, you've truly surpassed everyone's expectations," Hong Xiao Jun said, his voice filled with admiration.
"I just did what I had to do," Luu replied, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon.
As they walked, Luu couldn't help but think about the inscriptions on the huge stone monument. He knew that there was still a long way to go, but he was determined to continue pushing himself to new heights.
"Let's go

The human side was singing loudly, and when I looked at the overall ranking, the human race, which had been the highest ranked so far, didn't even make it into the top 1,000. These many wonderful images were nothing more than self-deception. What's the point of getting all this when you're not even in the top 1,000? But there's no way to get in; you can't get in. If you can't entertain yourself, wouldn't a bit of participation be better?

Just then, an audience member noticed something above the total ranking: Luu's ranking had advanced one place. This couldn't be more direct. Luu was starting to break in soon. More and more viewers realized this and got excited. Just now, it was the 2,011th place, and now it's the 1,999th. The flame of hope in the crowd was rekindled.

Meanwhile, the official in charge of broadcasting in Dashia also noticed this. Without hesitation, they abandoned the originally arranged editing footage and began to broadcast Luu's battle on the screen. Luu was holding a long sword, his body glowing with shimmering light, and he began to push horizontally. Many strong people's pupils contracted slightly when they saw this scene, and they were all shocked. Unlike the spectators who couldn't understand anything, they knew exactly what it meant. A shimmering light blooming all over his body meant that there were at least 30, even 40 inscriptions. An ordinary Dharma body could be condensed with only 36 inscriptions, and at this moment, Luu already had the embryonic form of a Dharma body. A realm to gather the embryonic form of a Dharma body? Are you kidding me? Such a crazy thing to happen. It turned out that Luu had been in seclusion for many days, and so many powerful people came to a sudden realization. Have to say, this retreat is too good to be true. It's only been a few days, and you've made this kind of progress.

As Luu kept swinging his sword to kill the monsters, he kept charging forward, moving further and further up the list. In just the blink of an eye, he broke through a thousand barriers, but with one sword, a huge monster collapsed. Luu didn't stop for a second and continued to charge forward. 900, once again, the sword was swung out, and the monster was ambushed. The sword of demon extermination, he used it more freely. This is not Luu's limit; far from it. 800, standing in front of Luu was a huge stone statue of a god general, and in front of him was a pious believer kneeling. Yet, it was still just a sword that killed the stone statue of a god general. 700, group after group of monsters pounced over. This number was quite astonishing, but Luu was not afraid. He constantly swam upstream against the current and slaughtered like crazy. 600, 500, 400, as Luu's ranking continued to soar, it finally caught the attention of the 10,000 races in the universe. One by one, they realized that Luu had once again begun to push across. At first, many malicious speculations, but none of them were fulfilled. It's just half an hour, and Luu's ranking had soared from the 2,111th place to the current 3,000th place. However, this time, Luu did not stop at the 3,000th place. Countless foreign races, looking at the crazy changes in that ranking, each and every one of them was a little panicked. That's too much momentum. This human little guy is going against the grain. This is a foreign race emperor with a lizard's head, pointing at Luu's battle image, and couldn't help but say, "His strength is even more powerful than before. Covered in shimmering light, he has mastered at least 40 inscriptions. Before this, he definitely hadn't mastered this many inscriptions. At most, only about 10. That means that during the seven days he was in seclusion on the seventh floor, he mastered nearly 30 inscriptions in one bite. Is that inscription tablet on the seventh floor that effective?" The moment these words came out, the several powerhouses beside them fell silent and then shook their heads. No way, there's no way that monolith is that effective. If that stone tablet is that effective, that disciple of mine wouldn't be unable to even break through to the eighth floor. Then this, the lizard-headed emperor couldn't help but let out a sigh and said helplessly, "It can only mean that the talent of this Marshall Saints' only son is simply too strong. My lizard Dragon Clans' genius Nan shei, I'm afraid he won't be able to keep his top 10 position these days." The lizard Dragon Clans' genius Nan shei had dropped in rank from 9th to 10th, and at this moment, with Luu's appearance, I'm afraid I won't even be able to keep tenth. Luu's momentum was too fierce. Mastering so many inscriptions, he could definitely charge into the top 10. As Luu kept punching, the entire human race was buzzing. After so many days of silence, the hearts of many people who were looking forward to that moment almost sank to the bottom, and one could be described as incomparably anxious. At the moment, it can be described as a bipolar reversal. How lost I was before, how uplifted I am now. Luu was still killing and sprinting. 300, but it was broken in a flash. Soon, Luu killed his way to the 200th place. He didn't seem the least bit tired and was still charging forward. This unrivaled momentum made the hearts of all the ethnic spectators tremble as they watched, and each one of them couldn't be more excited. "Kill! Kill! Kill!" Luu, Luu, Luu, uncountable people were calling out Luu's name under the

Under the anticipation of millions and the scrutiny of countless eyes, Luu fought his way to the top 100. The entire human race was buzzing with excitement. What was even more maddening was that Luu didn't stop there; he continued to sprint forward. In the blink of an eye, he reached 50th place, then 30th, 20th, and finally, 10th. It was only then that Luu showed a hint of fatigue, letting out a soft gasp.

Rushing forward in one breath had its advantages and disadvantages. The upside was that it allowed him to maintain the momentum of his invincible sword, like a snowball rolling and growing larger. The downside was the terrifying consumption of Chi and blood power. If not for his newfound mastery of various inscription descriptions, Luu feared he would have already exhausted his strength.

At this point, he could no longer sprint forward. Instead, Luu raised his long sword and looked at the countless monsters surging towards him. He couldn't help but laugh and charge forward, killing as one monster fell after another. His roster continued to advance: ninth, eighth, seventh. Luu was now able to see the boundary of the seventh layer, the entrance to the eighth. However, mountains of spider monsters stood in his way.

The inscriptions on Luu's body blossomed to their extreme. He had no reservations left, utilizing his strength to the fullest. Luu decided to use the third sword his master, Xia Wuyan, had taught him in the past. He hadn't been able to use it before, but now, the moment had finally arrived.

Chapter 112: Extreme Sword Prison

Most of the sword arts taught by his master had no names. Xia Wuyan's explanation was simple: "A sword is a sword, and a sword move is a sword move. Why does it need a name?" It was only later that Luu gave the swords names after countless battles. These names weren't given by Xia Wuyan, but earned through his relentless killing.

The first sword was the Lumen Sword Light, the second the Demon Punisher, and the third, the Sword Prison.

Luu raised his long sword, and it transformed from a bloodthirsty blade into a dazzling white light. He was surrounded by dense waves of spider monsters, each the size of a man or two, their strength likely at the peak of the first rank. Individually, they were nothing to fear, but their sheer numbers were terrifying. Just looking at them made one's scalp tingle and sweat bead on their skin.

Without hesitation, Luu swung his sword down. The sword light was biting cold, and as it descended, the surrounding space seemed to be shredded, giving a strange sense of distortion. This wasn't an illusion, but the result of the sword's power.

Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!

The spider monsters, surging like waves, were shredded to pieces. Blue-green tissue liquid splashed around, and in an instant, thousands were twisted into fragments.

Despite the terrifying power of the sword, it was a drop in the bucket. The number of spider monsters was simply too great. After killing one wave, another immediately surged forward, the overall number barely decreasing.

Luu knew this wouldn't work. Even a true Dharma body powerhouse wouldn't be able to kill all these spider monsters. He had to find a way to break through and reach the eighth floor.

He swung his sword again, carving a bloody path through the sea of monsters, splitting it in two like a chasm. Without hesitation, Luu plunged into the temporary opening.

The next moment, the sea merged back together, engulfing Luu once more.

"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Luu fought his way out, emerging bloodied and wounded, his body covered in injuries. It was the first time he had been in such a sorry state since entering the Reincarnation Tower. He glanced at the entrance to the eighth floor, so close yet so far. He was exhausted, his Chi depleted. Just one step away...

The next moment, the spider monsters, like a sea, engulfed him once again. He failed. What a shame.

Back in Blue Star Central Plaza, millions of spectators watched the scene unfold. Each one felt a pang of sympathy for Luu's defeat. Although reaching the end of the seventh floor was already incredible, breaking through to the eighth would have been even better. At that point, the first place in the realm's Reincarnation Tower would have been practically guaranteed.

But just one step away from the eighth floor.  The final level of the seventh floor was just too difficult. Spider monsters that looked like an endless ocean, just looking at them made your scalp crawl.

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

I felt numb. I didn't expect Luu to be able to surpass it so greatly. It's already amazing that he's the pride of our human race. By the way, what place did he come in? The rankings had been updated and displayed outside The Reincarnation Tower. The top Geniuses from all over the universe were stunned as they gazed at the constantly updated leaderboards. What had happened? Human Luu's ranking suddenly surged and, as if there were no obstacles, skyrocketed straight from outside the top 1,000. He rushed to a few hundred and then continued to advance, coming into the top 100 in the blink of an eye. 100th place was already a sufficiently impressive ranking, but it still couldn't stop Luu's momentum. It didn't take long for him to kill his way into the top 50, then the top 30, and even there, he still hadn't stagnated and was continuing to rise. All of the major foreign races - the Celestial Pride, the Rock God Clan, the Fire Clan - subconsciously held their breaths and stared earnestly at Luu's ranking changes. All of the Geniuses wanted to see just how far Luu could break through. The Divine son of the Star God race, Castro, couldn't help but exclaim, "Is he the son of a human Marshall Saint? That's really powerful!" The sea god, Simsic, couldn't help but say, "What a powerful human Genius! I really want to fight this guy. I wonder if I'll have the chance to next time." 

However, if he doesn't settle for second place, he should break into The Reincarnation Tower one more time when the time comes. There might even be a chance for us to cross paths. And I have to find out when he's going to break into the Reincarnation Tower before we can. In a spaceship, Luu slowly opened his eyes. "What a shame I ended up failing this move. I'm still not using it well enough." (Sword Prison) He frowned as he reflected on his question. Despite having mastered 45 inscriptions and being able to use the Extreme Sword Prison, it was still a bit too much of a stretch. If one could completely master the Extreme Sword Prison, breaking through to the eighth floor could be considered a handful without the slightest bit of pressure at all.

Chapter 113: Mission Accomplished: Obtaining the Taiu Diffracting Dharma Pel jauan looked at Luu who had just woken up and spoken differently. "It's too normal that you can't use the Sword Prison in its entirety." It wasn't supposed to be something that you could use at this realm, but I've already mastered 45 inscriptions. Luu naturally knew that it was difficult for him to use the Sword Prison at this realm, but he had already mastered so many inscriptions, so he might not be able to give it a try. He was still very confident, but in the end, it only resulted in a Sword Prison prototype - even if it was just a fledgling, it strangled countless spider monsters and hardened a bloody path. It was just a little bit short of reaching the eighth floor. If the degree of completion had been higher, even if it hadn't been completely finished, it would have been possible to break through.

Of course, I know. Jia wanan nodded non-committedly and continued, "But this move - the Sword Prison - is already considered a prototype of the Domain, and it's extremely difficult. Not something that can be accomplished by mastering dozens of inscriptions." Luu was stunned when he heard this. What is the Sword Prison considered a Domain fledgling? No wonder when he used the Sword, even if the 45 inscriptions were run to the extreme, he was unable to complete the move. Turns out, the difficulty is so horrible. This is the level above the Dharma Body in the Dharma phase. Luu couldn't even reach the Dharma phase right now. Let alone the realm. Only if it's so difficult, why does sefue still attempt it?

Teach this move, it made him think that it was originally something he could use in his realm, thinking like this, Lúu glanced at his master somewhat breathlessly. Now that you've taken a second, do you still want to continue to break into Xiao one's realm? Yǒu Yuán, however, ignored Lúu's sultry look and continue to ask, "Second, when Lúu heard this, he took a look at the rankings and he was at the end of the line, but he had actually rushed straight to second place. That's unexpected and makes sense as far as hard power is concerned. You can probably kill your way into the top five, and this second it's considered a good result. Jàiá Wán Nán said indifferently, if you're going to continue to barge in, once you fall down before where you fall down, the rankings will fall down, so are you going to keep breaking in? Lúu heard this and thought for a moment and said, "Of course, I'll break in, but I'm going to close down and cultivate for a while first. Second, although it's already a pretty good score, but Lúu was still not willing to do so. Second is no better than first since he had come to break into The Reincarnation Tower he had to take the first place, just like his old man." Anyway, let him break in right away, and he'll be hard-pressed to pick up a better grade. It would be best to close the door and cultivate first, organize the previous Gams, and become a bit stronger, in addition to that, there was another very important reason, and that was the main quest was complete. Lúu having killed his way to the second of The Reincarnation Tower, this Mainline quest, which was incredibly difficult, was finally complete on the system panel, a line of text slowly surfaced in front of Lúu's eyes, "Mission accomplished. The quest reward: Taiu Defraction Dharma pill has been issued. With the treasure in hand, Lúu was in no hurry to check it out as he looked up and asked, "Right, Master, where is Xiao Jing?" When he saw how well you performed, he decided to break into The Reincarnation Tower one more time, and this time, he had to break into the fifth floor. Xiao Wú An explained, so it was my performance that irritated him. Lúu nodded his head, and immediately began to close door cultivation. The quiet room of the Airship, Lúu looked at the newly acquired treasure, it was a round purple golden pill, somewhat similar to the Dragon Tiger golden pill, but the lines on it were obviously more subtle, and at a glance, he knew that it was not a mortal object. Tiú Defraction pill, rank ninth quality, Immortal type consumable effect, after taking this Elixir, one can increase one's understanding of the great Dao, and automatically deduce the appropriate Dao and Dharma description. Tiú's formlessness, the essence of Chi, its Gathering and dispersing, the guest form of Changer, an immortal Elixir that can be taken even by those of lower Realms, each time one realizes the way, one automatically consumes some of the medicinal power, until the power is completely depleted.

Lúu looked at the description of the Elixir and couldn't help but let his eye light up. Ninth order Immortal Goods, moreover, the first realm, surprisingly, worked his realm was simply too low, many rewards, even if obtained for a while, there is no way to use them, if this Tiú Defraction of Dharma pill could not be used at lower Realms, then there was nothing he could do. Fortunately, this Immortal elixir, which was truly extraordinary, directly took care of those in the lower Realms, each time you become enlightened, you automatically consume some, until the potency is completely exhausted, it won't be completely depleted, all at once, if the full effect was exerted at once, it would not have propounded Lu you to death, I'm afraid that this ninth order mortal pill would have to waste the vast majority of its effects, even if a realm was able to use it. Lúu couldn't afford to use it without hesitation. Lúu took out this pill and directly ate it in one gulp.

After the Elixir was swallowed, it instantly transformed into a warm current that disappeared in the twinkling of an eye, and then quickly coalesced in a certain place, that was the Dan Tón of the body. The Dragon Tiger golden pill, is here, at the moment, there was another Elixir, Tiú Defraction Dan, orally, the Dragon Tiger golden Dan, occupying the center position of the Dan Tón. At this moment, with the appearance of the Taiu Defraction of Dhadan, the Dragon Tiger golden Dan, even automatically gave up its position, as if to say, "Big brother, you are here, please, this position is reserved for you." The Taiu Defraction of Dharmadam, was also nonchalant, occupying the position, right in the middle of the Dan Tón. Lúu closed his eyes and concentrated, and the Taiu Defraction of Dharma pill, slowly rotated in this instant, Dao and Dharma, incomparably straightforward, appeared in Lúu's mind, unlike the Dao and Dharma displayed by others, it was someone else's, an answer that belonged to them and even if they watched, they would only be able to get the shape of it, not the meaning.

To a certain extent, the titanic defraction Dan, on the other hand, was directly deduced, making it simpler and rougher. The medicinal power of the titanic diffractive Dharma pill, no matter how much it was used, was limited and would disappear once it was depleted. However, the titanic immortal cell was different; it could be worn at all times and used indefinitely. Both had their own advantages and disadvantages, but if Lu You was given the choice, he truly didn't know which one to choose. The good thing was he didn't have to choose at all, as he possessed both. Lu You thought about this and then shook his head, dismissing the distracting thoughts, and began to focus on his cultivation. He waited for the retreat closure and called the 10,000 celestial pride to boil over, aiming for the first place Throne of the one realm reincarnation Tower. Lu You thought that the tower was definitely within reach.

As a result, when he ended his seclusion and opened his eyes again, he was dumbfounded. What was this situation? Chapter 114: Acquiring the Supreme Treasure. Lu You was completely immersed in the dao and Dharma, which could be described as uncontrollable, and gradually he forgot about the flow of time during this period of seclusion. His progress was miraculous; the inscriptions he had mastered had more than doubled compared to the previous 45. You know about inscriptions; the first one to 50 are fine, but the further you go, the harder it is to comprehend, and the difficulty especially skyrockets from 100 onwards. However, even so, Lu You had still mastered 108 inscriptions, and this rate of progress could be considered terrifying. If those golden body martial artists saw this, I'm afraid they would pass out on the spot.

On top of that, he took a portion of the inscription and strung it together, not all of them, just 13 of the inscriptions, but even so, the effect was still good. Nowadays, Luu's overall strength could be said to have once again gone up to a whole new level. He could break into The Reincarnation Tower of the first realm again, not to mention the eighth floor, even the ninth floor. The moment the retreat ended, Lu You was thinking this way, but when he saw the words on the light screen in front of him, he was a little taken aback. What the hell? The first realm reincarnation Tower has automatically closed. Challenger Luu, you have taken the second best overall ranking. Congratulations, Challenger Luu, you have obtained the greatest treasure, the white Jade Wind and Fire wheel.

Lu You no, dude, I was planning on continuing to break into the one realm reincarnation Tower, but it turns out you've already finished. The eyes closed, and the retreat was over, and so was the one realm reincarnation Tower. This is also too fast. Luu was speechless for a while, his mood could be described as very complicated, but when he thought about it, it seems to make perfect sense. This time in seclusion, his Harvest was simply too great. Not only had the number of inscriptions he had mastered skyrocketed to 108, but he had also managed to string 13 inscriptions together. How could such progress be made in just a few days?

Luu Hasty glanced at the time only to realize that almost a month had passed since he had closed his mind. This time let alone the end of the first realm reincarnation Tower, even the second realm reincarnation Tower, although it makes sense, it's still a bit of a shame. Lu You couldn't help but sigh. He had wanted to take first place in The Reincarnation Tower, but he didn't expect this to be the end. It's called regret always runs through life. This is life. Nope, it's not that there's no chance, although the first realm reincarnation Tower was over, there was still the second realm reincarnation Tower. Thinking of this, Luu hurriedly glanced at the treasures he had just acquired. The most precious treasure was the white Jade Wind and Fire wheel, level first order, can grow quality excellent type flying fabric. When used after stepping on it, it can greatly increase the user's speed. This treasure will grow with the user's level, up to the ninth rank.

Description: The most precious white Jade wind in fire wheel, modeled after a mythological Divine weapon with a strange style and superb effect, belonging to a rare treasure. Luu looked at the detailed description of this reward and was in a better mood. The stuff was imitation, but it was still very good, as it could at least be used up to the ninth realm. His current means of attack were not lacking at all, the way of the sword in martial arts, which was pulling attacks to the extreme, and the defense and movement aspects were slightly lacking. This white Jade Wind and Fire wheel was considered to have slightly made up for the shortcomings in this area.

Just as Luu was thinking this, he suddenly sensed something in his eyelids. He couldn't help but jump and think. The introduction format of this treasure was surprisingly exactly the same as the reward given by the system. If it wasn't for the addition of the word Supreme treasure in front of it, Luu almost thought that it was given by the system. Sure enough, this matches previous speculation. His system for the most part came from the last reincarnation or even many reincarnations ago. Maybe there was some connection with the owner of this reincarnation Tower. Thinking about this, Lu You couldn't help but think a little more. Since this system had chosen himself, could he make The Reincarnation Tower choose him as well? If it becomes possible, then...

In that era, the Lord of the Reincarnation Tower was an unimaginable entity, unrivaled throughout the universe. The human race was destined to rise again, or the relentless kind would become the sole Overlord of the universe, no longer a mere dream. Luu was inexplicably excited by this thought, despite knowing it was a fool's errand. When he had previously breached the first real reincarnation tower, he felt no difference, nor was he summoned. Perhaps the ninth floor would be different, though it was highly unlikely. Nevertheless, Luu couldn't help but fantasize, just as an average person might daydream about winning the lottery.

The system and the reincarnation tower were likely connected, and it was only natural to ponder this. The second realm reincarnation tower seemed necessary to breach. With these thoughts, Luu left his quiet room on the airship and headed towards the dining hall. It had been nearly a month since his retreat, and although nutritional potions had kept him from feeling hungry, he yearned for something delicious. As an S-Class ship, the Polaris boasted an impressive food reserve, with a vegetable and fruit cultivation bin for fresh produce, and artificially intelligent robots specializing in various cuisines.

Upon entering the kitchen, Luu found Xiao Jing already there. Xiao Jing's eyes lit up at the sight of Luu, and he recounted the events of the past month. Luu had fought his way to second place in the Reincarnation Tower, causing a stir throughout the universe. The human community raised their eyebrows in admiration, and Luu's reputation soared. Xiao Jing also mentioned the Seed God Clan's Sinic, who had expressed a desire to fight Luu. However, Luu had been in seclusion, so Sinic had decided to challenge the eighth floor instead, becoming the first contestant to reach it.

Luu was surprised by this news and revealed a look of interest. Xiao Jing continued, mentioning that Sinic had put out word that he was waiting for Luu to break into the second realm reincarnation tower and challenge him. Luu smiled, confident in his abilities. Xiao Jing asked if Luu was confident in dealing with Sinic, who was undoubtedly strong. Luu nodded, stating that Sinic had taken advantage of his seclusion and needed to be taught a lesson.

After the first realm reincarnation Tower, only a few days passed before the second realm reincarnation Tower opened. Those heavenly Prides who had ranked high in the first realm reincarnation Tower had upgraded their Realms and broke into the second realm reincarnation Tower again. However, just because they could stir up winds and clouds at the first realm reincarnation Tower didn't mean they could continue to call the wind and rain at the second realm reincarnation Tower.

Many top-ranked Geniuses of the first realm entered the second realm reincarnation Tower with confidence, only to return in defeat. Even the Se God Clan's genius, Xi in Zik, who had broken through to the eighth floor and gotten first place in the one realm reincarnation Tower, ranked only 37th in the second realm. Those ranked high in other Realms had difficulty even squeezing into the top 100.

Hearing this, Luu revealed an unexpected expression. There were so many experts in the second realm reincarnation Tower, even surprising him a bit. He knew this for a long time, but hearing Xiao Jing's narration made it more real.

Xiao Jing continued, "Many of the naturally powerful races in the universe are not born in the one realm. These special races are born in the second and third Realms, and some even reach adulthood in the fourth or fifth realm. These uniquely blessed races are not only born with great strength but also possess unique and powerful secret techniques."

In the second realm reincarnation Tower, many of these existences steadily occupied the top rankings. The situation of humans was similar to that of the first realm reincarnation Tower, with the best ranking being only 1,200.

As Xiao Jing narrated, Luu's eyes lit up with anticipation. "The stronger the opponent, the more motivated the challenge. It's no fun at all if it's all a bunch of rookies who just push through sideways." Luu had thought the Neptune Clan's synthesis was the main course, but it was just an appetizer.

Xiao Jing narrated about the second realm reincarnation Tower while secretly observing Luu's expression. Seeing his eyes light up with anticipation, he couldn't help but exclaim in his heart, "Big Brother deserves to be big brother."

Just then, Luu suddenly froze. There was a flash of surprise in his eyes because the system had come up with a new assignment. "You have managed to gain a billion points of reputation amongst the 10,000 races of the universe. Your reputation has emboldened these foreign races, who fear your rise yet cannot stop you. You did a great job with the last one, but you know that this is just the beginning."

The mission description was pretty long. When Luu carefully read it, he couldn't help but furrow his brows. He had thought the system Quest would allow him to continue his conquest and challenge more powerful foreigners, gaining more Prestige values like 10 billion Prestige points. In this way, he might be able to break into a second reincarnation Tower and complete it.

However, the system did not release such a mission. Instead, it told him to return to the interior of the human race and deal with the internal affairs of the human race. There were traitors within the human race who had betrayed Dasha and the human race. This was a mission for 40 years from now. The problem shouldn't be serious now, but since the system Quest was described this way, it meant that this problem in the future was bound to happen. As long as Luu completed this task, it would be considered completed.

Luu pondered a precautionary measure, slipping into deep thought. Regardless, this mission must be completed, even without a reward. It's crucial to eradicate illnesses for humanity's sake, though the task is undeniably challenging. It's significantly harder than previous missions, requiring extensive contemplation on the best approach. Xiao Jing, standing nearby, sought his elder brother, who seemed lost in thought. He didn't disturb him, instead sitting quietly.

Chapter 116: Annexation isn't rare. Bad news: the human race is internally turbulent, with traitors striking from behind. Good news: this is happening in the future, so no immediate need for change. If it were 40 years later, this task could be urgent. The only solution is to swiftly cut through the mess, suppress it with Thunderbolts, and excise all sources of rot. This way, humanity's ills can be swept away, though countless will fall in the process. Even a martial Saint's son would find it difficult.

The first stage of the mission was manageable, but the second stage was excruciatingly difficult. Complete the great unification, merge and integrate all nations, so humanity is no longer divided. This isn't an easy task, whether in the future or present. Luu pondered for a long time, acknowledging the task's difficulty but insisting it must be done. Moreover, the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower shouldn't be missed at this moment. There's no time limit, and no need for haste since it's 40 years later.

After much thought, Luu concluded that the master should promote the merger and integration of nations, preventing humanity's division. Even for a genius like Luu with a great reputation, it would still be incredibly challenging to accomplish. Therefore, involving the master in the plan was still necessary. Additionally, there's Popside, another challenge to overcome.

Master, Master, Luu excitedly approached, grinning. Xiao Wan glanced at him, asking what his business was. Luu explained that he'd been in seclusion for almost a month and came to say hello to the master. Xiao Wan remained indifferent, urging Luu to speak if he had something else to say. Luu then revealed his intention to involve the master in the plan. Xiao Wan, unconvinced, warned Luu not to push too hard.

Luu clarified his intentions, explaining that he wanted to discuss the news of his breakthrough in the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower. The entire universe of the 10,000 races was buzzing with excitement, and many Heavenly Prides were stunned. Luu smiled, saying he wasn't showing off but merely pointing out the loopholes in the human race's security. Xiao Wan understood Luu's thoughts and acknowledged the need to purge spies within humanity. However, he cautioned about the potential misuse of power in the cleansing process.

Luu agreed that this concern needed to be considered and addressed. The mission was still complex despite the apparent simplicity. Nevertheless, the task had to be done, beautifully and with the utmost care. Xiao Wan then asked Luu about the root cause of the problem. Luu pondered this question, recognizing the importance of identifying and addressing the underlying issues.

You thought about it and continued to ask the fundamental reason. Is that because the hearts of the human race are not united at this stage? There are still differences between countries. There's no way to hold together naturally. It's easy for spies to appear. Xiao Wuan slowly said.
Hearing this, Lu You asked obediently, "Then, can it be possible to let the human race be greatly unified, let the human race no longer have differences between countries?"
Difficult, Xiao Wuan shook his head. "It's not a simple matter. Can Master tell us more about it?"
Lu You's eyes glowed, hearing Lu You's words, Xiao Wuan gave him a somewhat strange look. Why did he inexplicably feel that this little guy's ultimate goal was for this? What does he care? But on second thought, Lu You went to the cabinet to participate in politics when he couldn't even speak well, and it seemed normal to be interested in these aspects. Xiao Wuan shook his head and said indifferently, "In this matter, you'll have to go home and ask your old Marshall father who single-handedly created this situation."
Hauh, Lu You heard this but he was unforgiving. He shook his master's thigh. "Master, just say something to be mature. He can be very mature, but if he is a child, he can also use being a child to his advantage."
Couldn't stand Lu You's repeated harassment, in the end, Jia Wuan still gave a rough account of the situation. It was very different from what Lu You had expected.
In Lu You's opinion, if Diaa were to annex other countries, the resistance would definitely come from those annexed countries, which was normal thinking. After all, who wants to be annexed by someone else? Who knew that the real situation was the exact opposite? Almost without exception, those small countries of the human race wanted to join the Granda to become part of it. This is not just lip service. They are for this conducted a number of referendums, sent out many times the application, almost crying, begging Dasha annexation of their own planets. Well, at least they are all human to manage.
As a result, Dasha didn't want these countries at all and didn't agree. Once the reason was simple. The great seas Nationals had high welfare, were the strongest, had the best conditions, and the planets under their command were without exception the richest Plains of Life. The Living planets of other countries, on the other hand, don't have the same conditions. Not only are the environments harsh, but the locations are quite remote. Therefore, Dasha didn't even care about annexing them.
Chapter 117: No, You're the Challenger in the Entire Ecosystem of the Human Race.
Desa occupies an absolute hegemonic position. Eating fragrant food and drinking spicy food while those other countries, which can only occasionally have a mouthful of soup, are living in a rather straightened situation. It's not even an exaggeration to say that they pick up Dasha's leftovers and all of this was driven by his old man, Lu Chang Xang.
It's not really accurate to say that making it seem like Lu Chang Shing is the bad guy. The reality is the human race at the time almost overthrown had reached the edge of exhaustion. It was because of Lu Chang Ching's sudden appearance that the human race had risen rapidly in the universe as the first 10 realm Marshall saint of the great seas and even the entire human race. He had made an unparalleled achievement. He was the one who alone shocked the evil gods of the 10,00 races, exactly Dasha's rightful position.
Rightfully takes the Lion's Share of the cake, with the remaining countries picking up some of Dasha's scraps and edges. Because even if it was some scraps, it was a living planet. Ah, placed in the entire universe, it was still extremely precious. It's been a lot better compared to the old days of misery. It started out that way. Surely it was right, and these countries had no other ideas and willingly acted as the Green Leaf of Dasha.
But as the saying goes, "It's not a matter of not having enough to go around." This side of Dasha is getting better and better, as the fire is cooking, and the flowers are blooming. Other countries on the other hand have been living in misery for a long time, and how can their hearts be balanced? After the people who witnessed that battle in the beginning grew old, the young people felt that it was not fair. Enough, they also want to be part of Dasha. But Dasha not only didn't want them but also utilized them in various ways, like a rich white woman teasing a licking dog, giving a little hope now and then but definitely not together.
It's not unusual for them to think differently over time. Actually, these things back along long time ago, Bayyo had said to Lu You. (Note: Chapter 6) It's just that the Lu You at that time, who was standing in the perspective of Dasha, in the perspective of his own old man, didn't think it was anything. Now that I saw this system Quest and heard Master say this, I immediately felt different. After all, the resistance is on the side of our own people. Difficult to get what's to be done about this.
Lu You frowned. Jia Wuan, when you saw Lu You thinking seriously about this issue, a small age with troubles that don't belong to him, by the way, do you still want to break into the second realm reincarnation Tower? Xiao Wuan asked indifferently.
"If we're not going to break in, we can go back," Lu You said without thinking. "But I have to ascend to the second realm first."
Good, Xiao Wuan nodded. Lu You turned around and returned to the quiet room. There was no hurry to break in first. He had already perfected the first realm.

And it could break through at any time. It wasn't much of a problem, so he decided to make a calm call to Pops a short while later. The call was answered soon, and Lu Chang's image appeared in front of Luu's eyes. "My chilling child, finally thinking of calling home," Luu said with some embarrassment. "Dad, I've been in seclusion for a while and accidentally forgot the time."

Lu Chang nodded. "Do you still want to break into the second realm of the Reincarnation Tower?" Luu replied, "Yes, because of the seclusion, I missed the time and didn't get the first place in the first realm's Reincarnation Tower. The first place in the second realm definitely can't be missed again. The second realm Reincarnation Tower is not ordinary; I'm afraid it will be hard to get first place."

Lu Chang said, "I know, but it's always a good idea to try." Luu shook his head and said seriously, "Moreover, I became stronger during this period of seclusion. How many inscriptions have you mastered?" Lu Chang asked casually. "Already mastered 108 of them," Luu replied. Lu Chang's face visibly stiffened when he heard these words, clearly not expecting Luu's rate of progress to be so fast. You have to know that inscriptions, the first 50 were fine, and the difficulty wasn't that high, but the more you got to the back, the harder it was to master. However, Luu acted as if there was no bottleneck. This kind of talent even Lu Chang was a bit surprised. "Good boy, what a way to surprise Pops! Not bad," Lu Chang nodded and gave a relatively positive assessment, then continued, "However, just mastering some inscriptions is just that. You can't be complacent yet. Stringing those inscriptions together is the key step, which is going to be a bit more difficult. Yes, this step is indeed difficult. It took me a lot of effort to connect the 13 inscriptions in series," Luu said rather agreeably. "It's good that you know what you're doing," Lu Chang said when he heard this, visibly freezing for a moment and glancing at Luu. "You've already succeeded, yes, otherwise, why would I say that I became stronger this time in seclusion?" Luu said rightfully. "Nice Guy, what a great guy. This kid's talent is many times more powerful than I had imagined," Lu Chang nodded and said, "Not bad, really good, worthy of being my son. In that case, you really do have a chance to break into the top rankings of the second realm Reincarnation Tower. What reward do you need for working so hard? I can fulfill you as long as it's not too much," Lu Chang said, obviously seeing that Luu had something to ask for. When Luu heard this, he couldn't help but be stunned. He obviously didn't expect his old man to see through it. "Is it really that obvious without hiding anything?" Luu said, the words his master had said to him roughly following by his own concerns: "If this continues to be allowed to go on, there will likely be civil unrest and betrayal in the future. This is a serious problem." Listening to Luu's narration, Lu Chang revealed some unexpected expression, clearly not expecting Luu to say this. He nodded and said, "This matter is not so simple. We have to think long-term. As for the mole, it's not that troublesome; it's well taken care of. I'll order it down." Luu listened to this and knew that there was too much involved and it was definitely not something that could be resolved in a single sentence. A short while later, the communication hung up. Luu also began to try to make a breakthrough without encountering any bottlenecks. It was very smooth to break into the second realm at the same time. He also refined the White Jade Wind and Fire Wheel with the power of his Chi and blood, and the Supreme treasure lived up to its name, instantly rising to the second rank. The attributes of all aspects increased significantly. After everything was fully prepared, Luu immediately decided to go and break into the second realm Reincarnation Tower. It was different from the last time when he broke right in without a word. This time, Luu let the wind out of his sails, no doubt about it, attracting countless attention. Whether it was the human race or the 10,000 races of the universe, all of them cast their eyes over, wanting to know which level this human race kid could break through to. When the SE God Clan Sinek heard the news, he didn't even hesitate to come and snipe to fight Luu. It was a coincidence; just the first battle, the two top Heavenly Prides of the first realm Reincarnation Tower bumped into each other. It was like a pinprick of fire; one side was first in the one realm Reincarnation Tower, and one side was second in the one realm Reincarnation Tower. The battle between the two great Heavenly Prides ignited the heat completely. On the first floor of the Reincarnation Tower, Luu looked at the opponent in front of him and said with a smile, "Finally given the chance to challenge me." Hearing this, Synth froze slightly, then slowly raised his head and said proudly, "No, you're the Challenger." Chapter 118: Trash talking, but you're really doing it. The battle between the two sides attracted enough attention even before it started. A month earlier, when Luu killed all the way to the second of the Reincarnation Tower and became famous in the universe, the Sea God Clan Sinek put out the word to fight Luu.

Countless foreigners eagerly awaited the rematch, but Luu remained silent. When the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower opened, the two sides did not clash. This lack of action made the universal races somewhat disinterested. However, upon reflection, it made sense. If Luu had participated in the battle and was eliminated in the first level, his ranking would have plummeted. While there was still a chance to re-enter and potentially reach second place, that was a big question mark. After all, strength is only one aspect; form and luck also play a significant role. Some Emperors analyzed that Luu's raw power could at most place him in the top five, and that second place belonged to Sinic. Therefore, it was wise for Luu to avoid the battle. Answering would either lead to another epiphany in progress or an arrogant misjudgment of his own strength. A sufficiently high ranking was worth a supreme treasure.

Soon, when the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower opened, Sinic of the Seag God Clan once again challenged Luu. His reasoning was simple: since Luu had concerns about falling in the rankings during the first realm, those concerns should be gone now that he had entered the second realm. As a result, Luu's silence was perceived as cowardly and drew criticism.

Luu had emerged from seclusion, and this long-awaited battle had finally begun. The previous rumors had dissipated. Now that he had emerged, Luu called upon the 10,000-strong Celestial Pride to witness the clash. "I am the challenger," he declared.

Upon hearing this, Luu's face subtly shifted. He smiled and shook his head. "I have grown again. I am no longer the person I was a month ago. You are not my opponent. If you seek easy prey, you are sorely mistaken."

Sinic sneered, dismissing Luu's words. It was normal for him to be number one in his own civilized community and the entire first realm Reincarnation Tower. He was even the first to break through to the eighth floor, though he had not yet reached that level in the second realm. This did not mean Luu could be disregarded. "Cut the crap. Unleash your full strength and fight me. Don't disappoint me," Sinic said indifferently. At the same time, the weapon behind him, resembling a lotus flower, slowly unfolded and hovered in midair.

Luu observed the scene and thought, "Numinous power." As the countdown ticked down, the battle commenced. "Come, please me," Sinic reached out, and the sharp blades behind him flowed like water, quickly extending towards Luu in a torrential rain of attacks.

Luu looked at the scene but remained unfazed. He slowly raised the long sword in his hand, which bloomed with a bright, dazzling light. "Sword Prison."

After a month, Luu used this move again. When he first mastered 45 inscriptions, he could only barely utilize the beginnings of the Sword Prison. Now, having mastered 108 inscriptions and successfully stringing together 13, the completion of the Sword Prison was only slightly higher. He had not yet fully mastered it, but the difficulty of this move was undeniable.

The moment the incoming sharp blades neared, they were flicked away with a sound. Sinic had repeatedly watched the video of Luu's breakthrough and knew the power of the Sword Prison, so he was not surprised.

"Break! Break!" Sinic commanded. The sharp blades that had bounced off the ground paused for a split second before launching back with renewed force. This time, they no longer attacked together but lined up one by one, attacking continuously in succession to forcefully break Luu's Sword Prison.

"He's fast," Luu thought, "He's found a way to counter it." Perhaps this was a tactic he had long considered. With the successive thrusts of the sharp blades, he was indeed tearing open the Sword Prison.

Luu was slightly surprised. If he were the person he was a month ago, he would have been on the verge of defeat against Sinic. But this month of seclusion had allowed him to grow too much. The gap between them had widened considerably.

Seeing that his attack had managed to create an opening in the Sword Prison, the corners of Sinic's mouth lifted slightly. "It's broken. You can die now. Have you made enough of a scene?"

Luu looked at him differently and raised his sword. In an instant, the range covered by the Sword Prison rapidly expanded. In a flash, it extended out 100 feet, completely covering the area as a large ring. As the completion of the Sword Prison increased, the controllable range naturally grew larger and larger.

Feeling the rapid transformation of the space around him, Sinic's face suddenly changed drastically, revealing a look of disbelief as he stared at Luu in astonishment. "How is this possible? How is this impossible?"

Luu glanced at him and said in a somewhat strange manner, "Didn't I already say that this month of..."

I'm no longer the same person I was a month ago, and you don't believe me. So, what am I supposed to do? Is this just some insincere trash talk to intimidate the opposition before the battle begins? There were 100 seconds of preparation time, and most intruders would use that time to chat and psyche out their opponents. Who would have thought that you wouldn't engage in any trash talk, and that all of it would turn out to be true? As the range of the sword prison increased, the sharp blade, which had been previously invincible, was suddenly suppressed by the sword prison space to the point where it couldn't move. Do you have any more tricks up your sleeve? Luu looked at him calmly and asked, his expression completely indifferent. "If not, then you can go die." Linc was taken aback, feeling extremely humiliated. Just a moment ago, he had been thinking of you as the challenger, but he didn't expect you to be this strong. Luu shook his head slightly, and in the next instant, countless sword lights stabbed directly in front of Linc's body. A layer of scaly armor immediately appeared on Linc's body surface, which was the Supreme Treasure obtained from the One Realm Reincarnation Tower. (The armor then) mixed with Zip! The sword light struck the armor, making an extremely unpleasant sound. This Supreme Treasure armor was indeed not bad, but it was ultimately only of the second rank, and couldn't block the constant assault of the sword light. Poof, poof, poof! Countless tiny sword lights, after striking through the scales, drilled in along a gap, and in just an instant, they had already dug through the complete armor. Since it had already turned into a lump of flesh and mud, Cynthia was eliminated.

Chapter 119: Lincer's Enlightenment

Linc of the Posidon clan lost. He had lost so quickly that he was instantly defeated, and Luu didn't even get to enjoy the battle. No one expected the gap between the two sides to be so wide. At the time of the first Realm Reincarnation Tower, Linc still had an absolute advantage. Luu, who was from the human race, was unable to break through to the eighth floor, even with his best efforts. However, the sea god Clan had successfully rushed to the eighth floor. On the eighth floor, Linc became a little stronger by attending to the new stone tablet, thanks to which he was in the second Realm Reincarnation Tower, breaking into the front rankings. There were too many Heaven-defying demons in this second Realm Reincarnation Tower, but he had been doing pretty well. And yet, even with this Linc in front of Luu, he still lost so quickly. It was a dry and embarrassing defeat.

After just a month of seclusion, Luu had clearly become stronger. 

The Spectators of the 10,000 races of the universe, the countless Heavenly Prides, and the one and only powerful person were all numb after seeing this result. Why is he getting stronger so fast? Why is he so fast? This is outrageous. When he first started breaking into the first Realm Reincarnation Tower, Luu had mastered about 10 inscriptions. This was already an amazing natural talent. After all, he wasn't someone who destroyed his foundation and re-trained, but a true genius of the first Realm. How long has it been, and he's already mastered over 100 inscriptions? Even this move, the Extreme Sword Prison, was used decently. Originally, his natural talent was stunning enough, who would have thought that the rate of progress would be even more Heaven-defying?

But in a month's time, Linc didn't even deserve to be Luu's opponent anymore. Although it was said that the greatest characteristic of the human martial arts system was that the speed of getting stronger was fast, those who went forward as martial artists to become stronger quickly were one who lived shorter than the other. Just for the sake of defending the glory of the human race, they were charging all kinds of craziness on the battlefield, like a bunch of crazy people. However, at lower realms, humans didn't have much of an advantage. Therefore, this Luu was definitely not normal, with no doubt about it.

With this battle over, among the 10,000 races of the universe, Luu's attention was unprecedented. The ring as Linc died, the Scaled Armor he was wearing burst and fell to the ring. When Luu saw the scene, he couldn't help but feel a bit greedy for the White Jade Wind and Fire wheel. After making up for the flaws and speed, the only thing lacking now was defense. Unfortunately, this thing was something that had a master, and even if you defeated your opponent, you couldn't get it.

Fittingly, as Linc is resurrected in a spaceship, the scaly armor is returned to his body. Even Linc's face was ugly. He couldn't help but clench his fists, and for a moment, he was in a jealous rage. Why? Why is it that in only a month's time, he had become so strong? It was expected that Luu would become stronger after all. It disappeared for a month, it would be strange if there wasn't a little change. But he never expected that in just a month's time, Luu's strength had undergone a drastic change. This was a flagrant fight at best. Who would have thought that Luu would directly crush him? When the sword prison expanded, he didn't even have the slightest bit of resistance left. You didn't lose unjustly.

On the side, the sea god Clan's Emperor slowly spoke, "Matriarch Linc looked up in consternation. This sort of thing already vaguely has the flavor of a domain." The Emperor of the sea god Clan said slowly. "Domain." Linc froze for a moment, a look of disbelief on his face. The sea god Clan's Emperor nodded.

Note: I made significant changes to the text to improve grammar, sentence structure, and clarity. I also made some minor adjustments to sentence formatting and punctuation to make it more readable.

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

And continued, if I'm not mistaken, he has already mastered over a hundred inscriptions and has even begun stringing them together. This little guy is truly powerful. Listening to the patriarch's unstinting praise, Cic's face became even uglier for a moment, synthetic of the sea god Clan was the first place in the first realm of reincarnation. Tower. Not only did Luu win it, was a complete and crushing victory. With the end of this battle, the entire human community was completely boiled after a month, the heat of the topic about Luu once again exploded. Meanwhile, in the midst of this unprecedented heat, a massive investigation is quietly underway. All these years down the line, Marshall St L Chang Ching's means had spread to all the major planets and cities of the human race, used to investigate some human spies. It was like hitting a mosquito with a cannon; it couldn't be simpler. With the assistance of a powerful man, and the intelligent detection platform of Tiang Gong, one spy after another was quickly unearthed. Identity established, location determined, next it was just a matter of waiting for closing time in the meantime. All the races of the universe, countless spectators, and countless powerful people were all watching Luu's breakthrough live broadcast with great interest. They were curious to know just what level this little guy from the human race had broken into at the second realm of reincarnation Tower. He easily defeated Cynthia, which was indeed strong. Only in the second realm of reincarnation Tower, there were quite a few demons who could do the same. Luu once again began his frantic mode of breaking and entering. Tier 1, tier 2, tier 3. Obviously, the second realm of reincarnation Tower was quite a bit harder than the first realm. But the good thing is that he had gotten stronger in all the same. In one breath, he broke through to the sixth floor before becoming slightly exhausted. Eventually, Luu broke through to the seventh floor on the seventh floor of the second realm of reincarnation Tower. There was a similarly huge stone monument. It was different from the one in the first realm. The stone monument with billions of inscriptions engraved on it. On top of this huge stone tablet, there was actually only one inscription; an immensely complex inscription. The Dawritten on this stone tablet was the Daw of inscription Fusion. This was a step up from a simple tandem; inscriptions could still be like this tandem Fusion Dash. Lou, you vaguely understood something, and it seemed like he had grabbed some very crucial information in the dark, but he couldn't describe it accurately in the same time. The Tiue Immortal cells and the Tiue diffractive Dharma pill began to operate slowly. It was as if the fog was gradually lifted, and things that were originally vague and unclear gradually became clear. Luu's eyes whitened, and he saw it. The fusion of inscriptions, the ultimate direction. Was the extreme of the Dharma body. The root of the formation of the Dharma phase, and the like, the origin of the formation of the domain. So, that's it, that's it in this instant. Luu was completely mesmerized and once again began to have an epiphany. Inscriptions, Dharma bodies, Dharma phases, domains. It turns out that the relationship between the four is like this; the simplest analogy is like points, lines, surfaces, and space; points make lines, lines make surfaces, and surfaces make space. The final space is also the Prototype of the rule. Borrowing from the huge stone monument on this seventh level, Luu enumerated for seven days and seven nights in one breath until all the rest time was exhausted. It was only after he was automatically teleported outside the danger zone that he woke up, as if in a dream.

Chapter 120: A sword opens the Heavenly gate, strongly breaking into the eighth floor. It's over. Luu looked around, his eyes filled with regret. Seven days have passed since then, not enough not enough at all. To be honest, Luu had really thought that the effect of the epiphany, when the three were combined, Tiue Immortal cells plus tiue D Plus inscriptions, couldn't be so good. Pity if I had been given another month, I could have gone to the extreme of the Dharma body, and even formed a Dharma face prototype. Being in the middle of an epiphany, he was suddenly teleported out. This kind of abrupt ending, feeling simply don't be too hard to bear. Luu was a bit upset, but there was nothing he could do about it. During these seven days of seclusion, he had naturally gained a lot. Not only had he comprehended the inscriptions to 128, he had also successfully strung together 45 inscriptions. There is no doubt that the strength is once again off the charts. It would have been more or less difficult to get first place in the second realm of reincarnation Tower now it looks like it's not too late to give it a try. However, these seven days of enlightenment had also stretched the time that was already left even further. Luu scanned his personal information. Name: Luu. Race: Human. Current floors: Seven. Current ranking: 2595. Current area: Hazardous area. Countdown to the end of the Tow of reincarnation: 4 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes remaining. Number of break-ins: Six. Second realm of reincarnation Tower: less than 5 days left. But is enough? I wonder what the situation is like with this Second realm of reincarnation Tower. Breaking in, is there any Heavenly Pride that has broken through to the eighth floor? Is there any demon who has broken through to the ninth floor? There won't be none, will there? Then I'm not welcome. Luu raised his head, his gaze becoming gradually determined. His idea was simple: if you wanted to complete the systems Mainline Mission, push forward.

For the grand unification of the human race, a formidable power of speech was essential, and the Reincarnation Tower presented an opportunity to prove oneself. For this reason, Luu did not express his intentions within the Heroes of the Great Summer group, fearing it would be dismissed as childish nonsense. In the Reincarnation Tower, a higher ranking and the acquisition of more Supreme Treasures were crucial to be recognized as a future Marshall Saint or Little Sword Saint. The major Powers would then value his opinions and ideas. With this in mind, Luu disregarded such thoughts and immediately began his charge.

In the second realm Reincarnation Tower, Luu's ranking began to surge forward once again. The news spread throughout the human community, causing immense excitement. Everyone watched Luu's progress with bated breath, as it was a scene reminiscent of a month ago when Lu you, after shutting down for seven days at the seventh level, emerged and swiftly climbed to the top, surpassing more than a thousand competitors in one breath. This time, Luu started even lower, at over 2,000. The second realm Reincarnation Tower was also more challenging, and the opponents were formidable. Could Luu replicate the miracle he performed earlier in the countless pairs of expectant eyes?

As Monster after Monster fell before Luu, he rapidly moved from over 2,000 to 1,000. The speed was astonishing. Meanwhile, the 10,000 races of the universe were eagerly tuning in to the live stream. Some alien powerhouses were surprised to find that in just seven short days, Luu had once again transformed his body, becoming even stronger. The speed of his growth was truly Heaven-defying.

However, a month or so ago, Lu you was like this after shutting down for seven days at the seventh level. After coming out, he pushed all the way across the board, directly from more than a thousand, killing the second place in one breath. This time, he started even lower at over 2,000, and the second realm Reincarnation Tower was even more difficult. The opponents were even more formidable. Could he ever replicate the miracle he did in the countless pairs of expectant eyes?

Just as the order to close the net was communicated, one human spy after another was plucked out. The light feed was suddenly interrupted, and no more images came through. The Fate powerhouses were dumbfounded. "What's the situation? Why isn't the human live feed showing anymore?" they wondered. "Problems on the Human Side? Damn humans, let me see it again before you choke the live feed," some exclaimed. But it was too late. They could only stare at the rankings on the second realm Reincarnation Tower, where Luu was still soaring wildly, indicating that he was still pushing all the way across the board.

"There's no live stream to watch, so I can only stare," they lamented. "Urgent, urgent, urgent. Why isn't it showing? The human race is too petty," some complained. But the Fay just couldn't watch it live. Those spies would be in deep trouble for treason, and the crime of treason was no joke.

As Luu pushed his way across the board, his ranking continued to soar, as if there was no bottleneck. A month or so later, Luu raised his head. In the distance, the second-ranked spider monsters, resembling waves of the sea, came surging in once again. This scene was all too familiar. More than a month ago, Luu looked extraordinarily small when he faced this terrifying number of spider monsters, and even with all his might, he could only barely kill his way out. At that time, he was covered in wounds, and his Chi was even completely depleted, so it could be said that he was in a sorry state to the extreme.

Although he managed to kill his way out, the next second, he was engulfed by these spider monsters and directly failed to break through the barrier. After a month or so, these spider monsters had changed from first order to second order, so the difficulty had risen more than just a little bit. Luu recoiled from the pounding sense of Crisis. "Is this what it feels like to be stronger? It's really good," he thought.

Blue stone, Central Plaza, and millions of Spectators looked at the great tide of spiders in the distance, subconsciously holding their breath. In the second realm Reincarnation Tower, how many demonic Prides had all fallen at this level so far? There hadn't been a single demon that had managed to break through the seventh floor and arrive at the eighth floor. If Luu could break through to the eighth floor, he would be the first place winner of the second realm Reincarnation Tower.

Just then, the camera gave Luu's face. Everyone was shocked to find that there wasn't even the slightest bit of gravity in his boyish face. Instead, he revealed a faint smile. "What a smile," they thought. "At this point, he's still swimming." Everyone froze. A bold idea was born in his mind. "Can you really break through to the eighth floor right this instant?" the entire human Community, nearly a thousand living planets, all fell silent. Yanying Shuang, Chin Yun Li, Shu kanay, and all the little friends of the Great Summer Heroes group who were familiar with Luu without exception were all staring tightly at the screen. Jiang banga tightly grasped the sleeve of the beautiful woman on the side, looking extraordinarily nervous. Bay yuyo stared at the screen with the same seriousness.

The next moment, Luu's ranking began to surge even more rapidly. The second-ranked spider monsters were no match for him. With a swift and powerful strike, Luu broke through the barrier and soared to the eighth floor, becoming the first place winner of the second realm Reincarnation Tower. The human Community erupted in cheers, and the Fay watched in awe. Luu had done it again, replicating the miracle he performed earlier in the countless pairs of expectant eyes. The human race had proven that they were not to be underestimated.

Spider waves were coming in; Luu swung his sword without hesitation. It was as if the sea had been parted, and the densely packed spider monsters were churned up mercilessly under the sword prison space. Luu did not hold his head high; the sword prison, with all its firepower, consumed too much chi, and even with the inscriptions replenishing it, it was impossible to maintain for too long. Luckily, he had both feet on the white Jade Wind and Firewheel, making his running speed more than a little bit faster. In an instant, he rushed through the sea of spiders and arrived at the end of the seventh floor. However, the thick Heavenly gate leading to the eighth layer was not open at this moment. It seemed to require a certain condition to be met before it could be opened.

At the same time, behind Luu, the wave of spiders once again attacked, wanting to completely engulf him. Chop! Luu swung his sword and chopped again, but instead of chopping at the spider, he chopped at the thick Heavenly gate. Puman sword light, the luminescent sword light which had long been skillfully mastered, was displaying unprecedented power at this moment. With just a single sword, he broke open a gap large enough to drill through that thick Heavenly gate. Luu did not hesitate; his feet stepped on the white Jade Wind and Firewheel, and he made a fierce sprint, forcing his way through the eighth floor.

Chapter 121: A Meeting of the Worlds, A View of the Mountains. The moment he rushed towards the eighth floor, Luu immediately felt a repulsive force. Even if you chop open the Heavenly gate, you still can't enter it. The eighth level was denying him access. It's not right; it doesn't seem so resistant. How? Why is there still a sense of rejection when Luu's contemporary practice he single-handedly brought Yu Guang to the end of the seventh layer, but the seventh layer ended up directly refusing his entry. The situation at the moment is very similar yet different. Luu did not hesitate; he fiercely exerted his strength, and the white Jade Wind and Firewheel under his feet rotated crazily, and then he forced his way in, along with Luu entering the eighth floor. His reincarnation Tower ranking had directly changed from 23 to first place.

In the meantime, at Blue Star Central Plaza, everyone watched as Luu opened the Heaven gate with a sword and forced his way to the eighth floor, and each of them stared with white eyes. Is this okay? It was reasonable to say that even if you chopped open the Heavenly gate, the eighth floor would still deny you entry because you don't have the strength to match it. But Luu was able to break right in. This also showed that with Luu's original strength, he would be able to enter the eighth floor. He just thought it was too slow to go through the door by the book, so he chose to forcefully chop through the door. As Luu's ranking rushed to first place, the human community, the originally quiet major planets, immediately drew unprecedented cheers. First, first place in the Wheeling Tower! If the second of the one realm reincarnation Tower was considered a small regret because of Luu's seclusion, it was lost with it. Then the strong return at this moment is to prove a point. What he had lost, he had to get back with his own hands. How about the second realm reincarnation Tower? So what if there's a lot of heavenly pride in demons, still pushing all the way across the board and holding on to first place.

In the meantime, outside the second realm Wheeling Tower, with the rankings refreshed again, Luu's ranking fixed at first place. The specific information was clearly displayed on the current layer, the eighth layer. The pride of the 10,000 races of the universe saw the scene and each of them stared in disbelief. Huh, he broke through. This is the eighth floor of the second realm reincarnation Tower. How is that possible? It's countless Celestial Pride couldn't help but suck in a breath of cool air when they saw this scene. Although I know that the human Lu you was very powerful, but still did not expect that he can go this far. The human race had always been known for their fast cultivation speed, and at lower realms, their strength was very average. It turned out that this son of the Marshall Saint was so terrifying. The second of the one realm reincarnation Tower was even when he reached the second realm reincarnation Tower; he instead became even more fierce and directly killed the first. This kind of natural talent, this kind of enlightenment, it was really too Heaven-defying.

In the meantime, when Synthic of the Sea God Clan saw this news, his eyes widened. In this instant, the depression in his heart was swept away. He had been haunted by his previous defeat in that battle. He had really lost too much, putting out so many harsh words only to have them wildly slapped in the face. It was simply a disgrace to the Sea God Clan. The heart of the da was shattered to this day. So much time has passed, and no adjustment has been made. It was only at this moment, after seeing Luu kill all the way to number one, one in the second realm reincarnation Tower, suppressing so many Supreme Prides, that he realized one thing. It turned out that the previous defeat was not his problem, but that this guy was too perverted. Synthic had also broken through to the end of the seventh level and knew the difficulty over there. How exaggerated it really was. At that thought, he was even a little glad. It was fortunate that Luu had not come out early and taken his first place.

Upon reincarnation tower's first realm, CIC had secured the top position, suppressing Luu. Now that Luu had claimed first place in the second realm, he was considered on par with CIC. Synthetic Moon improved, and I will also attempt to surpass the second realm of the reincarnation tower or, at the very least, achieve a higher ranking. The Polaris spaceship is impressive.

As Luu broke into the eighth floor, Xiao Jing exclaimed in shock. Jawuan gazed at the image before him, his ancient face tightening. This little guy has progressed at an astonishing rate - a month ago, he could barely manage the sword prison's rudimentary prototype. Now, he has mastered it completely. This extreme sword prison of mine is not so simple to master. When Luu was first taught the three swords, the idea was to use the Extreme Lumen sword light in the first and second realms, Punisher of Demons in the third or fourth realm, and the Extreme Sword Prison in the fifth or sixth realm. Over the next decade, if Luu could master these three swords perfectly, he would possess supreme talent.

Jawuan recalled Luu's words about inheriting his mantle and becoming the first sword saint of the human race. He had dismissed them as naive, unaware of the challenges involved. Now, seeing Luu's progress, he felt a mix of emotions. Dash Lou sighed in relief and looked around the scene, raising his eyebrows in surprise. This is the eighth floor, filled with a lake, swamp, clouds, and mist, extending as far as the eye can see. Luu sat in a small boat, with a faceless stone man at the stern, holding up the boat with a long bamboo pole.

A curtain of light appeared before Luu's eyes, displaying his information: name, Luu, race, human, current number of floors, eight, current ranking, first, current region, excessive region, countdown to the end of the Tower of Reincarnation, four days, 22 hours, and 40 minutes remaining, number of break-ins, seven. Luu realized he was already number one in the reincarnation tower after breaking through to the eighth floor. He shook his head, throwing these thoughts out of his mind as he carefully looked at the surrounding scene. It's not a safe zone or a dangerous zone - it's an excessive zone. What does that mean? A challenge will arrive soon. Luu quickly adjusted his state as the boat moved along at a leisurely pace.

Stone tablets soon surfaced on both sides, with no inscription but a strange line. Luu couldn't read or understand it, but this was the stone tablet of the eighth floor, and it wouldn't appear without any significance. He didn't think much about it and hurriedly sat down on his knees, carefully sensing these marvelous lines. The TYU Immortal Cell and TYU Defc of Dharmadam once again began to operate. After a long time, the mist was lifted, allowing Luu to see the truth behind these lines. So that's how it is. Chapter 122, True Me, False Me - Sword Breaks the Ninth Level under the dual effects of the TYU Immortal Cell and the TYU Diffractive Dharma Pill. Originally, it might have taken hours, if not longer, to have a little bit of an epiphany. For example, the Seed God Clan CIC, after he broke through to the eighth floor and referenced these stone tablets, only made slight progress and became slightly stronger. But at this moment, Luu entered the mode of Enlightenment as soon as he came up, understanding the true meaning behind these seemingly simple lines, which leads straight to the source. There should be 128 stone tablets corresponding to the 128 inscriptions that Luu had mastered. These stone tablets have marvelous lines on them, some of them are dragon flying, some of them are strong and powerful, and some of them are as if a child has just begun to write, crooked and planted, but without exception, each line had an ineffable subtlety. They were.

To better understand the fundamentals of inscriptions, these lines must be examined more closely. They lead directly to the source, which can be described as a Simplicity Avenue. As long as the nature of the 128 inscriptions is fully comprehended, it's almost like piecing them back together. These liths provide a path for me as I gazed at a line in front of me. Luu's heart shook, and he couldn't help but turn his head to look at the faceless Stone Man. He asked his big brother to slow down, but the faceless Stone Man ignored him and continued to support the boat alone. Luu realized there was no communication and wasted no more time, hastily beginning his enlightenment.

In a moment, Luu was completely captivated, constantly comparing and analyzing this remarkable line with the inscriptions he had mastered to understand the essence of the inscriptions. To simplify, imagine Luu as a person who could only speak but was illiterate, unaware of how words should be read or written. Not knowing words doesn't affect verbal communication, but trying to read is impossible. As Luu continued to understand the true meaning of these inscriptions, it was like learning to read and write. Unfortunately, these true intentions remain only among the stone tablets; one cannot rely on memorizing them and understanding later.

These true intentions only exist among the stone tablets, making it impossible to rely on memorization and understanding later. Even if Luu could memorize these lines and refer to them later, it wouldn't work for the monolith on the seventh floor. Understanding the meaning is different from memorizing the shape. It's as if the soul is lost, perhaps the unique nature of these inscriptions.

The boat moved forward at a leisurely pace as Luu continued to comprehend. The more he analyzed, the more he felt that behind this seemingly simple line was unfathomable depth. Each line contained the truth of the Dao and the essence of The Da. Even with the constant operation of the immortal cells in the Dharma Defra of Daradan, Luu couldn't fully comprehend them. He had a feeling that if he could grasp the essence of this Dao and the truth of this Dao, he might touch the edge of the rules.

Stepping into the rules would make Luu a Marshall King of the eighth realm, above the Dharma body and the Dharma phase. With Luu's current level, even touching the edge of the rules was nearly impossible. He hadn't even reached the extreme level of deducing the Dharma body. This would be like trying to reach heaven in a single step or understanding the nature of words and creating a new writing system without learning to read and write first. It's anticlimactic and not always beneficial to take such a massive step. Luu knew this and continued his enlightenment step by step.

Time passed, and the monoliths were seen. The boat suddenly stopped near a shallow beach. On the beach stood a figure with feet on white jade, holding a second-order alloy long sword. This was the end of the eighth floor, and Luu's only opponent here was himself. Luu was surprised and a bit offended when he saw the figure. They walked to the shallows, and their eyes met in a frozen moment. Without hesitation, Luu drew his sword.

Both Luu and his opponent sent out their swords simultaneously, and their sword lights were equally luminescent. The swords collided, and they were evenly matched. Luu frowned and struck again, using the Red Dust Sword Technique. To his surprise, the opponent also used the same technique. As they raised their swords, Luu was momentarily bewildered and broke through the illusion to strike again.

The opponent also used the Punisher and Exorcise the Devil moves, and their movements and power were almost identical. Luu was dumbfounded, thinking it was the same person but couldn't break the move. He dismissed the thought as a fake, believing he still had a chance to win. Luu struck again with the Sword Prison, but this fake's completion level was actually higher than Luu's. Luu was taught a lesson, as the fake had fully mastered the Sword Prison while Luu was still on the verge of mastering it. In a blink, Luu fell into the opponent's trap, seemingly defeated. This was the first time he had encountered such a challenge.

Luu had encountered a strong enemy since he entered the second realm of the Reincarnation Tower. The situation was troublesome, but Luu quickly reacted. Since the enemy could use a complete sword prison, it meant that Luu could do the same. Understanding this, Luu squinted his eyes and carefully observed the many details of his opponent's sword prison. He constantly drew on these details as a means of perfecting his own sword prison.
On the verge of defeat, Luu finally made a breakthrough and fully mastered the sword prison. This time, the two sides were once again on equal footing, although it was still hard to beat his opponent. Luu recalled the true meaning of the inscriptions he had previously comprehended and began to try to make a breakthrough on the battlefield. He linked those complex inscriptions together.
Half an hour later, Luu managed to string together 54 inscriptions and killed the fake in front of him with a single sword. He was panting heavily, covered in wounds, but it was a win nonetheless. Luu raised his head to look at the ninth level's Heavenly gate. At that moment, the gate, which was slowly opening, did not need to be cut open with a sword. Luu didn't think much and stepped directly into the ninth floor.
Meanwhile, outside the Reincarnation Tower, information about Luu was updated again. He was still in first place. However, the current tier had come from the eighth tier to the ninth tier. This update of information was unremarkable at first. No Heavenly Pride noticed it until one of the Fay was idly bored and took a look at Luu's message. They then just stayed on the spot, stunned.
"Hauh, did I read that right? The number one ranked Luu is currently on the ninth floor? This is absolutely amazing news!"
Chapter 123: Lord of 138 Planets
Master Shonza stood apprehensively not far from Lu Chang Xang. His expression was somewhat ugly. They don't agree, Lu Chang Xang glanced at Chong's face and said indifferently, "This matter is indeed troublesome. However, it must be pushed forward in the end. There has to be a way to discuss it."
When Zonza heard this, he couldn't help but let out a bitter smile and said, "No, Master. The great clans of Diaa all agreed to accept those vassals in small countries after deliberation. Thus, promoting the great unification of the human race. Oh, Lu Chang Xang wasn't surprised to hear this and continued to ask, "Then, what about the price? What they mean is that those Dash vassals, as well as many small countries, will be merged into Dasha, which is certainly possible. But Shu Gonza wanted to say, 'But there's no harm in saying it, Lu Chang Xang.' However, he still continued, '138 of these living planets have to be divided under the name of Junior brother Luu, so that he can become the master of these 138 planets.'"
With those words, the temperature in the room instantly dropped to freezing point. Lu Chang Xang narrowed his eyes slightly and faintly asked, "Are they thinking I'm old? Although Lu Chang Xang also understood the art of politics is the art of trade-offs and compromises, but the idea of these people already has a way of taking death. Zonza felt his master's anger and was so frightened that he almost prostrated himself on the ground. He said with an ugly expression on his face, "What the great SE great clans mean is that Junior Senior brother's Talent is so impressive that his future is bound to be unlimited and more than likely, he will be heading towards the path of becoming a saint. And that would essential need to go through battles and tribulations. These 138 planets are the testimonies to his path to becoming a saint. They think that by saying such kind words, they can just gloss over it."
Lu Chang Xang sneered. Jonza swallowed his saliva and continued, "They also said that these 138 planets just hanging on the head of the young Master. You can also be in charge, and perhaps sometime in the future, let the young Master go over is not too late. That's a lot of people, Jord Gonza didn't name any of the families but said, 'many people.' This is indeed what many people mean. Allowing Luu to become the Lord of those 138 planets and allowing the son of the Marshall Saint with an unlimited future to take on more and more responsibility in the future were the aims and thoughts of these people. 138 Planet Lords may seem scenic, but these places are not the rich Dasha life planets. Taking them over means taking on responsibilities in the future that would otherwise not be necessary. This made Lu Ching unhappy. In his opinion, Luu didn't have to be so tired. There's no need to carry the entire human community on his back. As he does this, it is too much. Not to mention he's still so young. But these families did not back down. Their attitude is clear. Even if he faced the wrath of Marshall Saint, Lu Ching Xang would not hesitate to do so. At this moment, Lu Ching's dissatisfaction was like a volcano about to erupt.
Jonza trembled with fear, not daring to utter a single breath. After a long time, Lu Chang Xang spoke coldly, "I often say that those who don't plan for the world are not enough to plan for a moment. Those who don't plan for the world are not enough to plan for a moment. Those who don't plan for the world are not enough to plan for a moment."

The entire situation is not sufficient to plan for a region. Perhaps it's the fact that I constantly look at the big picture that gives these people the illusion that I won't rush the table. At these words, Jonza raised his head. He knew that some people were about to fall this time; they had gone too far, even trying to rely on the junior brother, who had just touched the Master's scales.

Suddenly, Bay Yuyo burst into the conversation with gusto. BYU Ya froze for a moment when she noticed something was amiss. Is something wrong? Lu Chaining forced a smile and opened his mouth to ask. Little Luu had just broken through to the ninth floor. Yuyo spoke, "Hm, even Lu Chaining froze for a moment when he heard this. The ninth floor? Zonza on the side couldn't help but widen his eyes and exclaimed, "Junior brother, he really has the stature of a Marshall Saint. That's natural," Yuyo said with a smile. "To be honest, I didn't expect he would break through to the ninth floor. If you guys are talking about it, I'll take my leave." Aha. Lu Chaining nodded. His mood was a little subtle. Breaking into the ninth layer means that Luu has the potential to break through the tenth realm. Originally, these planets, considered unnecessary burdens, have now turned into an excellent aid for breaking through the tenth realm. You go and tell them that I will consider this matter, and moreover, ask little Luu what he thinks. Lu Chaining said, "Whether or not he wants to become the master of these 138 planets depends on his decision. In addition, if Luu agrees, then these families must give assistance to help build these planets for the future of the tenth realm. They must do their part." Hearing this, Zonza couldn't help but stare. Since the Master said this, it means that he has already agreed to it, and he only needs little brother to nod his head. All right, Master, I'll convey it, Jonza said. Subsequently, Lu Chaining instructed a few more words after Jonza left. Lu Chaining shook his head, his expression somewhat complicated. One by one, two by two, they are all like this, only knowing how to calculate the immediate and not knowing what the big picture is. That's a really good point about little Luu. How can you govern a country with such a bunch of bears? However, if Luu wants to break through the tenth realm in the future, he must devour the civilization flames of the foreign races and kill the evil gods, thus proving his own worth. Becoming the master of these planets is not a bad choice. Originally, I didn't want him to carry too much and didn't want him to live a life that was too tiring. However, the fact that he broke through to the ninth floor shows that he has the stature of a Marshall Saint. If a second 10th realm Marshall Saint truly appears, then everything will be different. Saying so, Lu Chaining couldn't help but show some anticipation. All races are surrounded by powerful enemies, and the human race is surrounded by enemies on its back. Although the human race is strong enough now, he knew very well that it wouldn't last long before falling. A second person must step up. When Rock God Clan's Rock Central Fire heard the news, his eyes stared like bronze bells with a look of disbelief. Those other Heavenly Prides haven't even reached the eighth floor yet, and he's already broken through to the ninth floor. Ever since Luu defeated himself, Fire in the Rock had always treated Luu as a target to catch up with. However, he did not want Luu to directly ride the dust; not to mention catching up, at the moment, even looking up to be unable to see. In the ancient legends of the Rock God Clan, any intruder who steps into the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower is expected to achieve a 10th realm true God, and there are more or less similar rumors in other communities. Almost all celestial prides were clear about what arriving at the ninth floor actually meant. As the news spread quickly, the expressions on the faces of many Heavenly Prides, major demons, and countless other powerful people were nothing short of brilliant.

In the past few days, the back pain disease almost couldn't straighten up. Write a chapter needs a long time; three chapters is already the limit. Temporarily, no way to add more. Wait for the next month. The body bone is better, and then add more for everyone.

Chapter 124: The Law of Heaven and the Image of the Earth

That cute little guy back then was able to break through to the eighth floor in the second realm Reincarnation Tower, ranking first among the 10,000 races in the universe. It's unbelievable how long it has been since then, and he's become so strong. In the elf clan spaceship, the elf clan's young girl Amisha couldn't help but marvel at the blond-haired teenager on the side when she heard this. He had an odd look on his face. What's wrong? You have this look on your face because you can't hear me praising someone else's goodness, Amisha asked with a smile. Sister, it's not. The blond-haired teenager shook his head, wanting to speak but just saying what he wanted to say. Amisha glanced at him. This human that sister is talking about just now broke through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. The blond-haired teenager spoke with a complicated expression. Ha, hearing this, Aisha's entire body froze as she

She stared at the blonde teenager with disbelief, her expression filled with astonishment. "Impossible! Do you know what the ninth floor represents? True or false?"

"Won't you know if you go and see?" the blonde teenager said with a bitter smile. Amisha didn't say anything and hastily checked the ranking of the Wheel Tower. The first place was still Luu, however, his current tier, without realizing it, had changed from the eighth tier to the ninth tier.

"It's really the ninth floor," Amisha muttered, her eyes filled with horror. "If she had only broken through to the eighth floor and ranked first among the 10,000 Clans, she could still smile and praise the little brother she had bumped into at the beginning. But he was already so strong... the ninth layer... it meant another Marshall Saint. She could no longer laugh. This is big news! The ninth floor, surprisingly true! Something's wrong. Could it be that the human race is going to produce another Marshall Saint? Impossible! Absolutely impossible! Two Marshall Saints from one clan? What a joke! Report this news quickly!"

The news of Luu's breakthrough to the ninth layer was like a wildfire, starting a prairie fire and spreading rapidly. Whether it was a Heavenly Pride or a powerful person, their expressions at this moment were all quite wonderful. While these foreigners were confused, Luu had already stepped into the ninth floor.

The ninth floor, the highest point of the Wheeling Tower. It's freezing out here. The wind was howling more than a little, and there were particles of ice in the wind that slapped haphazardly at his face. Luu frowned and looked around. The sky and the Earth were gray. The temperature here was extremely low, and even though Luu had already broken into the second realm, he could still feel the piercing cold. Amidst the wind and snow, in the distance, a blurry figure was located between Heaven and Earth. Just then, the figure slowly stepped out. He wore ancient armor and carried a walking lance in his hand, just like a respectfully armored warrior. With every step he took, the ground which was frozen into ice collapsed downward by one point. As the other party continued to approach, Luu's expression gradually became grave as he subconsciously gripped the long sword in his hand. "This opponent is not simple. 100% would be tougher than himself on the eighth floor. I really didn't expect this ninth level, and there is no preparation and rest time. A boss fight right off the bat! Exciting!"

Luu's eyes were fixed on the figure that kept approaching, and there wasn't the slightest bit of fear in his eyes. Instead, he was leaping with the intention of battle. He knew very well that even his own old man had been thwarted at the ninth floor, and he was more than likely hanging on as well. But so what? Even if you know you're not going to be able to beat them, you still have to battle it out.

As the figure slowly approached, he spoke, "I've been sleeping here for 30 million years, and finally, a challenger has come. I hope you please me." With that said, the heavily armored warrior slowly opened his eyes. The moment he saw Luu, a trace of consternation clearly flowed under the mask of that hideous beast face. Obviously, even he did not expect that this time the intruder... "Even I can't believe how small it is. How old are you? Just to break in here is the new reincarnation of the human race? Even so anticlimactic."

After a brief moment of confusion, the heavily armored warrior spoke again and asked, "What is your name?"

"My name is Luu," Luu opened his mouth.

"And you?"

The heavily armored warrior was silent for a long time, seemingly pondering the question, and only after a long time did he speak up and answer, "My name is Which Horse You On."

Hearing this, Luu asked curiously, "Can I ask just how many reincarnations ago did you come from?"

"Can't remember," Which Horse You On shook his head. "This is just a sliver of my Divine Soul Detachment with limited strength and limited memory."

Seeing that the other party was very communicative, Luu gave an inch and continued to ask, "Then, if I want to become the Lord of The Reincarnation Tower, what should I do?"

As soon as these words came out, Which Horse You On obviously froze for a moment and then looked at Luu with incredulous eyes, clearly stunned by the question. "Lord of The Reincarnation Tower?" Wuan said in an odd tone. "You kid, you really dare to think?"

Luu certainly knew that his question was too whimsical, but if you can't even dream about it, you're too chicken to do it. He looked up and continued, "No, no, it's okay. Woto said, 'What should I do?'" Luu continued to ask.

"I don't know," Which Horse You On slowly shook his head.

"Luu, what the hell, even you don't know?"

"You can defeat me first. If you can't even defeat me, let alone become the Lord of The Reincarnation Tower," Wuan raised the stepping lance in his hand. "I'll give you a chance to make the first move." The implication was that if he made the first move, Luu would not stand a chance.

Hearing that without the slightest hesitation, Luu swung his sword out. "Pull Sword Prison!" The completely mastered Sword Prison was like a small domain that instantly enveloped Which Horse You On. In an instant, countless tiny sword lights from all directions chopped towards Which Horse You On.

Before they could get close, they were all bounced off. Which Horse You On slowly raised his head and said indifferently, "This move... there is something interesting about it. Is this simulating..."

Here is the text improved in terms of English:

The realm that employs this technique is apparently not sufficient to challenge me; you can see how I am attacking and being hit by it. Just watch my movements carefully. Which horse youan, who was carrying a massive sword, slowly raised his hand and his entire being - in terms of form and momentum - skyrocketed upward in an instant. What was in front of Luu's eyes was no longer a uniformed warrior; it was now a colossal behemoth that resembled Tarzan, its body towering above the others and impossible to grasp at a glance. Luu raised his head in shock and could only see one of the behemoth's thighs, with his sword prison, which could hold up to 100 feet in a square, not even comparable to the behemoth's thigh. Dharma, Heaven, Earth, above the Dharma body, the Dharma phase, the Heaven phase, the Earth phase; this is only the second floor of The Reincarnation Tower. Who can break through the ninth floor here? Chapter 125, full of surprises. The towering giant is not just a physically large being with a strong exterior, but has also risen over a thousand times in terms of strength and defense. Even a simple kick shakes the ground, creating a difference in strength so huge that it's no exaggeration to say that even if the extreme sword prison was on fire, it would still be difficult to scrape off a layer of skin from someone. That's why Which horse youan said that he would give Luu the chance to make the first move, but if Which horse youan made the first move, then Luu would not even have a chance. The difficulty of this ninth layer is truly exaggerated. Luu stared blankly at the behemoth in front of him, a being of the Dharma phase, the ultimate stage. It should already be the most powerful of all. Even if it's not extreme, it's still at the top. There is a difference between Dharma and Dharma; the difference is even greater than the difference between a Dharma phase and a Dharma body. When Luu first entered the Dharma Realm, he might have been able to resist for a moment or two with his extreme sword prison, but this behemoth in front of him was different; just one foot down would be enough to break mountains and rivers, the difference is too great. He didn't want to admit defeat. The towering Which horse youan looked down at Luu, who seemed like an ant, and faintly asked, "No"? Luu raised his head with a hint of fear in his eyes and laughed out loud, saying, "Let me see how powerful this peak Dharma phase of yours is!" With his feet on the white jade wind, Luu soared wildly in mid-air, with his sword prison temporarily withdrawn, and he raised the sharp sword in his hand - the extreme demon Punisher. The speed of this sword was extremely fast, and it could stab the giant almost instantly. However, in Which horse youan's opinion, this was nothing more than a mantis blocking a chariot, being self-defeating. Rumble, there was a clap of thunder coming from above. Luu looked up and saw that it was actually a large hand that had directly swung out, creating a sonic boom. It was too fast, like swatting a fly, and in an instant, Luu was swatted, with even though he tried his best to resist, there was still no room for resistance. The tremendous wind pressure created by that terrifying speed pressed him dead-center, and soon he was slapped out of the air, directly smashing towards a distant mountain peak. Rumble, a huge hole appeared in the snowy mountains; the ninth floor was broken into. Luu opened his eyes at once and couldn't help but open his mouth, "The ninth floor is too hard to beat; that guy has the law of Heaven and Earth; how can this be beaten"? Xiao wuan, who was on the side, heard this and unexpectedly smiled, saying, "It's normal for you to lose. The Dharma phase is divided into nine realms. The first to the third realm is the stage of going from the virtual to the real; the fourth to the sixth realm is the stage of the increase of the Dharma phase; and the seventh to the ninth realm is the stage of the Dharma Heaven and Earth. The guardian of the ninth floor should be at the ninth level of the Dharma phase, with this kind of strength, it's naturally impossible for you to be an opponent." But you've already far exceeded my expectations by being able to break through to the ninth floor. It had to be said that this time, Luu was truly unexpected and impressive. "Hearing Master's words, the original bad mood from the failure got a lot better." I'm a future Sword Saint, so breaking through to the ninth floor won't be a breeze. You know what? Xiao wuan smiled at Luu, who looked at his master, and among the 10,000 races of the universe, there has always been such a legend circulating. Xiao wuan slowly said, "But any Heavenly Pride that breaks through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower is an existence that is expected to achieve the 10th realm." Luu's eyes lit up once again when he heard this. He really hadn't heard of such a statement. The fact that you were able to break through to the ninth floor also means that you have the potential to do so. This is great," Xiao wuan continued. But Luu heard something in Xiao wuan's words. "However, precisely because of this, the universe is 10,000 races. I'm afraid that their Heavenly Prides are not the same. Not everyone can achieve the 10th realm."

Attention is focused on you, rising to numerous levels. Joan Yuan stared intently at Lüü and said word by word: "They won't wish for humanity to produce another 10-thousand-year Marshall Saint, so even at all costs and consequences, they will have to stifle you before you mature further." Lüü's eyes narrowed, sensing a chill run down his spine. The journey to break through the barrier was unprecedented – topping the first of the 10,000 races in the universe and being the first to kill in the ninth floor of the second realm's reincarnation Tower, 30 million years ago. This time, Lüü's fame resounded like thunder among the 10,000 races, causing the Heavenly Prides. His name became the talk of one civilized Group after another. Lüü believed that for a lengthy period, he would be a hot topic before that, he didn't have a good reputation at all. Everyone said he was the Crown Prince of humanity, arrogant and domineering, and enjoyed playing with rules recklessly due to his honor. This story of the old man's hero and his son's was a popular one among the foreign races, lamenting that humanity's Marshall Saint had given birth to such a son.

However, Lüü's reputation flipped around upside down. It went from bad to good in a split second, becoming the human Race's second future Marshall Saint. Although Lüü's fame was great, it had turned into a mere whisper of his potential. He had yet to grow into a genius that could be choked in the cradle easily.

Jaan Yuan's words directly pulled Lüü back to reality. Master's words made sense as saying: "If wood is peeled in the forest, the wind will destroy it." It's more so true for humanity, which is still an enemy of all races. This time, Lüü had indeed shown incredible progress but had exposed himself to the gaze of the 10,000 races of the universe. It's hard not to get a little stressful thinking about this. After a while, Lüü raised his head and said, "Seriously, Master, you make some sense."

Lüü wasn't supposed to be in the limelight as the son of a Marshall Saint. If he was to keep in the shadows, he wouldn't have to go through such a difficult process. However, nowadays, breaking into the reincarnation Tower is accelerating the process ahead of time. It's stressful and motivating for the strongest of the 10,000 Clans. The Clans don't want to see another Marshall Saint appear in the human clan. They want Lüü to become one for them. Hearing such words, Jawan looked at Lüü's firm eyes and couldn't help but be surprised. It's clear that Lüü hadn't expected this response.

Xia Wanan continued to speak, "Since you've already broken through to the ninth floor, there's no doubt that you're the first in the second realm reincarnation Tower. Just wait for a few days and you'll get a supreme treasure." Yet, there's another question: Are you going to break into the three Realms reincarnation Tower again? Hearing this, Lüü couldn't help but be frustrated, furrowing his brows. If he started rapidly raising his realm now, he would be barely keeping up by the time the three Realms reincarnation Tower was almost over. With 128 inscriptions mastered, Lüü had already overcome the bottleneck in the early realm, which was nothing more than water polishing and slowly improving. However, the problem is that forcibly raising the realm would lead to an unstable Base. This is particularly true for martial artists.

Lüü had just broken through the blood and flesh realm and had only begun to temper his muscles and bones. However, forging the bones was not easy to get, as it required repeatedly beating his skull among other parts of the body. The vast majority of aspiring martial artists would not choose to go to the viscer refining realm due to its tedious process, and instead stayed at the second realm and continued to raise their bone forging, starting from copper, iron, steel, and ending at Jade bone. The foundation of the four realms is crucial, he thought.

If he were to forcibly break through to the Third Realm, it would be the opposite of falling short and would introduce hidden dangers in the future. The way of the martial artist is always moving forward. What kind of setback was that? Lüü shook his head and said, "Seriously, Master, I won't go to the three Realms reincarnation Tower to join in."

I made some minor changes to the text, including:

* Improving sentence structure and word choice
* Adding some transitions and connectors to make the text flow better
* Using more precise and descriptive language
* Making some minor changes to punctuation and capitalization
* Changing the wording of some phrases to make them more idiomatic and clear
* Adding some extra words to clarify the meaning and context where necessary

In this instance, there's no need to forcefully elevate the realm; laying a solid foundation is the top priority. I'd like to shed some light on Versailles, but let me clarify that he hasn't obtained the supreme treasure yet. Getting his hands on two of them is already enough, considering he's been away for so long. It's time for a trip back. Hearing this, Xia Wuan slowly nodded. In fact, Xia Wuan had already decided that if Luu attempted to break in, he would stop him. However, he didn't realize that the little guy was not greedy at all.

Master, I'm going to retire to the quiet room to cultivate first. To summarize the gains of this time, Luu spoke up, "Go." Xia Wuan waved his hand, and Luu retreated to the quiet room. Luu sat cross-legged, and the huge phallic figure flashed continuously in his mind. The difference between a Dharma body and a Dharma phase is a world of difference in power. In mythology, the law of the heavens is a divine power, an unteachable aptitude that can only be realized through self-reliance. The law of Heaven and Earth, also known as the law of Dharma Heaven and Earth, is the extreme of the Dharma realm.

In the midst of his continuous Enlightenment, an aura suddenly flashed through Luu's mind. The aura flickered and could not be caught. Who or what was that? The tissue Immortal cells within Luu's body instantly operated, allowing him to capture that bit of Aura once again. Gradually, Luu gained some clarity and finally understood where the fundamentals of the Dharma phase lay. Dharma phases are derived from Dharma bodies and are inseparable from inscriptions. The fundamentals of the fantasm came from the fusion of inscriptions.

When Luu was at the seventh level of the second realm, the huge Stone tablet he saw was clearly a fusion inscription. Luu thought back to the huge stone monument and then tried to think back to the Heavenly Phantom. There was such a Harmony between the two that surpassed anything he had ever experienced. When Luu entered seclusion once again, time passed day by day. These days, Luu's reputation without a doubt spread rapidly amongst the 10,000 races of the universe.

As the second realm reincarnation Tower was about to end, there was finally a Heavenly Pride that had broken through to the eighth floor. Originally, this eighth layer should have been the result that made countless Heavenly Prides look up to the undoubted first place. But now, in front of Luu's ninth layer of achievement, it was dull and the light was all snatched away. That stopped at the eighth floor of the Heavenly Pride at this moment is even more skeptical. This defeat my other self so much stronger than me. CH's physical strength is even more unlimited. This is how to win. How did Luu break into the ninth floor with the end of the second realm reincarnation Tower?

Luu unquestionably got the first place in the meantime, he also woke up in seclusion. The second realm reincarnation tower has been automatically closed. Challenger Luu, you have taken the first place in the overall ranking. Congratulations. Challenger Luu, you have obtained the most precious Treasure - Dragon Scale war armor. Seeing the words on the light screen in front of him, Luu couldn't help but be delighted. It was actually a defense type Supreme treasure. Earlier, he was still eyeing that Supreme armor of Cix. He didn't expect to get one for himself in the blink of an eye.

Luu hurriedly checked the details. Treasure Dragon Scale war armor, rank second. K Gro quality, excellent type defense equipment. Effects: after wearing, can greatly increase the defense ability. Additionally, there is a certain degree of unloading effect. At the same time, for the Thunder water attribute attack, has excellent damage reduction effect. At the same time, increase a certain degree of Thunder water attribute attack effect.

Description: The Flying Dragon leaves the sky and follows the clouds into the abyss. The submerged dragon is in the abyss and follows the clouds up to the sky. Although it is not crafted with real dragon scales, it is still a rare treasure. Luu's eyes lit up as he looked at the string of descriptions in front of him. No doubt about it, good stuff. Absolutely great stuff. Moreover, the Supreme treasure obtained by the first place winner of this second realm reincarnation Tower was obviously quite a bit better than the Supreme treasure obtained by the first place winner of the first realm. There are gaps. Luu spread out his palms and gently patted his chest in this instant. The Supreme Treasure Dragon Scale battle armor directly appeared on his body. It automatically adapted to the size of Luu's body and did not appear ill-fitting. On the battle armor, a piece of dragon scale was neatly arranged, the edges as smooth as a mirror, transmitting a faint luster. Wearing it on his body at the moment, it didn't look cumbersome at all, and as his arm swung, it looked extraordinarily powerful and domineering. In the shoulder armor position, a dragon's head is used as decoration, as if it could come to life in the next second. Luu took two steps left and right, and the crisp sound of dragon scale armor clashing made him extraordinarily fond of it. Nice, that was great. Luu looked left and right and in the end, he even came in front of the mirror and stared for a long time before walking out of the quiet room.

Inside the restaurant, Xiao Jing saw Luu walking and was just about to greet him when he saw the dazzling dragon scale battle armor on his body and couldn't help but widen his eyes. This battle armor is... Luu walked past him without a word.

Luu turned around, allowing Xiao Jing to see the full details of the dragon scale battle armor, a supreme treasure he had just acquired. He couldn't help but smile and ask, "Not bad, right?"

Jing couldn't help but exclaim, "More than good! This is simply too handsome and awesome!" Hearing this, Luu smiled and nodded, already looking forward to the next banquet get-together.

In Chapter 127, Master Master's great deal heavy treasure set, as the saying goes, "Not returning to one's hometown when one is rich is like traveling in brocade at night." Luu had broken into The Reincarnation Tower this time, first in the second round, then first in the first round, with two supreme treasures right out of the gate. This had to be flaunted. Life would be a lot less fun if people couldn't pretend to think this way.

Luu feasted in the dining room and ran all the way to the room where his master, Jaia Wuan, was meditating. Hearing Luu's yelling voice, Jaia Wuan couldn't help but furrow his brows and open his eyes to look at this somewhat noisy disciple.

"What's wrong, Master?" Luu asked, showing off his supreme treasure battle armor. Jaia Wuan nodded and gave such a pertinent evaluation, "Just okay."

Luu couldn't help but ask, "Whom?" Jaia Wuan faintly answered, "On the way to achieving Marshall Emperor, how many great storms and waves had been broken through. His eyesight was naturally extraordinary. Although this dragon scale battle armor was good, it hadn't reached the point where he was amazed."

Luu nodded helplessly, then suddenly opened his mouth and asked, "However, Master, don't you feel that something is missing?" Jaia Wuan narrowed his eyes at Luu, knowing that this kid had nothing to do and must have something to come over to offer.

Luu felt that his mind was seen through, and he was a bit embarrassed. But since he was embarrassed, he couldn't get nothing. He smiled and said, "Master, just a dragon scale battle armor with my clothes, it's a bit too strange. If it can match with the whole set, then it would be even better, right? Now it's still missing the lower garment, the boots, the lacing."

Without waiting for Luu to finish, Jaia Wuan glanced at him and said, "You're really thinking beautifully. This kind of supreme treasure is an idol for me. Where am I going to get you so many supreme treasures?"

Luu froze for a moment. It was a big shock for a while. It's not he just wanted a whole set to go with it. Who would have thought that Master was planning to give him the entire supreme treasure set? Is this the sword Emperor's handiwork? It was horrible as hell.

Luu hurriedly said, "No need for a supreme treasure. Second or third rank will do, and it's good enough to go with this dragon scale battle armor of mine." Jaia Wuan slowly shook his head, "If it's not a supreme treasure, how can it match your dragon scale battle armor? You can tell the difference almost at a glance, and that makes it look even more awkward."

Lu Yu Jawanan furrowed his brows and pondered for a long time before speaking, "I don't have that many supreme treasures, but I still have heavy treasures. So I can barely put together a set for you. Heavy treasures paired with supreme treasures isn't a disgrace. Even those martial emperors are paired like this."

Luu froze for a moment. Heavy treasure? Jaia Wuan nodded and said, "The so-called heavy treasure is slightly worse than a supreme treasure. The great is probably around the seventh to eighth rank, and it's just right to use it with this dragon scale battle armor of yours."

Luu couldn't help but open his mouth when he heard this. To be honest, he hadn't really thought that his master would be so generous. His initial thought was simple. It would be enough to have his master give him a second and third-order set to go with a set. This is nothing to the master. As a result, now when he made a move, it was a few heavy treasures, making him a little embarrassed, as if he was knocking the Master's bamboo bar.

Jaia Wuan glanced at Luu, reading his mind in a flash, and asked indifferently, "Do you think that I can give away rags of the second or third rank? How could I possibly collect those rags?" The reasoning was indeed this. Luu nodded and said with some embarrassment, "However, Master, this is too much of a break. A disciple doesn't have any merit. How can I dare to receive such an expensive gift?"

Jaia Wuan shook his head, "You got the second place in The Reincarnation Tower in a row, as well as the first place, and established a great reputation for the human race. This is already a heavenly feat. How can I, as a master, not show it moreover? It's just a few heavy treasures. To those grand masters and marshal kings, they might be treasures, but to me, it's actually nothing. You don't have to feel embarrassed. Since I decided to give it to you, then you can accept it graciously. Why make such a squirming gesture?"

Luu Lu you listen to these words, no longer squirming, and readily accepted. There may be no way to repay the Master's favor anytime soon, but in the near future, he would find a way to repay. Perhaps Master had been so kind to him, teaching him the way of the sword to the best of his ability, never expecting anything in return. But while the master did not take these to heart, Luu could not help but take them to heart. In order to match the supreme treasure dragon scale battle armor, Jaia Wuan gave a total of several heavy treasures.

Five heavy treasures: tops, bottoms, combat boots with lacing, and crowns. However, even the heavy treasures of the seventh or eighth rank were too heavy for Luu to use. It's like a three-year-old trying to wield an AK-47; even if they pull the trigger with all their might, the recoil alone could injure them.

To allow Luu to better utilize these heavy treasures, Jawanan had imposed a layer of seals on them. As Luu continued to grow stronger, these seals would gradually be lifted. While it's not as good as the growth treasure of the reincarnation tower, it's not too far off. Wearing dragon scale battle armor, stepping on a white Jade Wind and Fire wheel, and holding the Jly Shen Chang sword, along with this set of heavy treasures, Luu was armed to the teeth. He was simply too cool and handsome.

Xiao Jing was envious when he saw Luu's outfit, but he also had the self-awareness not to ask his father for the same equipment. After all, Luu had obtained the second treasure of the first realm reincarnation tower and the first treasure of the second realm reincarnation tower, spreading the human's heavy reputation throughout the Universe. It's only natural to have these rewards for such merit and honor. Compared to Luu, Xiao Jing was practically worthless.

Luu noticed the look in Xiao Jing's eyes and asked with a smile, "Don't you want to give it a try?" Xiao Jing hesitated for a while before asking apprehensively, "Is it really possible?" Of course, Luu nodded. Xiao Jing was the teacher's son and had received such a heavy treasure from the teacher, but he refused to even lend it to Xiao Jing to wear for a bit. That's too petty.

Xiao Jing nodded with some excitement, but these treasures would automatically change their size after simply wearing them for a while. Jao Jing hurriedly returned it to Luu, not wanting to wear it again. Luu asked, "It's already enough," but Xiao Jing was reluctant to part with it. This thing, after all, wasn't his own, and being able to try it on for a while was already satisfying.

"Big Brother, thank you," Xiao Jing said, and Luu smiled with satisfaction. However, Yu Ya suddenly turned her words around. "Luu, this set of heavy treasures is too dangerous and too easy for people to get jealous of. It's not safe for you to wear them."

Luu hurriedly spoke, "You can't think like that. It's like a child holding gold through the downtown. He who doesn't move his mind is not a man. A man is not guilty of harboring a treasure. Not to mention Grandmasters with so many of your treasures, even martial emperors would be red-eyed when they see them."

However, Yu Ya said seriously, "So all these supreme and heavy treasures of yours, hand them all over to Mom for safekeeping."

Luu was dumbfounded. He never dreamed that in the house of Marshall Saints, the matter of mom keeping your year-end money for you would even occur. This will never work, Luu thought, but Yu Ya had already reached out and grabbed Luu like he was grabbing a chicken.

Luu was no longer the same as Luu back then and just by sidestepping, he dodged her grasp. However, Yu Ya's speed was much faster, and Luu's back was cold, knowing that it was not good. His body's inscriptions were running, and his speed surged, but Yu Ya once again grabbed an empty hand on the premise of not utilizing the domain as well as not injuring Luu. It really wasn't that easy to escape from her grasp.

Improved English version: It was simple for Bayu to catch the current Luu, but BYU didn't intend to get serious either. She didn't genuinely want to catch Luu, as she saw Luu flee in a puff of smoke. Yu ya couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Let's see if you still dare to misbehave in front of me, kid. You scared me to death. Why don't you show off in front of L Chan? In front of the Marshall Saint, these two supreme treasures, along with some heavy treasures, are nothing. But mom is just a Grandmaster, so naturally, it's better to show off only when necessary." Luu realized he had missed the mark; he never thought his mom could come up with a safekeeping trick that scared him into fleeing and no longer daring to misbehave.

Women thought to themselves, "What a terrible thing." Luu sighed and muttered under his breath. Just then, there was a cough from behind. Luu turned around quickly, only to realize he didn't notice when Pop appeared behind him. Luu's eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Come here quickly, Lu Changxang!" Lu Changxang waved his hand, saying, "This one of yours is quite decent. Did your master match it to you?" Luu nodded, "He's hemorrhaging money. These heavy treasures are all top-quality, all of the eighth rank, not a single seventh-rank heavy treasure."

Lu Changxang glanced at them further, adding, "Moreover, among the eighth-rank heavy treasures, they are considered among the very best." Luu realized this as an afterthought: these treasures were not given by the system, not by The Reincarnation Tower, and they were also sealed, so Luu didn't know their exact grade. The teacher didn't say anything, so Luu thought, "Sensei is really generous. An eighth-rank heavy treasure is even a treasure for a ninth-rank Marshal Emperor."

Lu Changxang touched Luu's head, saying, "Your teacher is very good to you." Luu nodded, "No wonder I just bragged about it at my mom's side, and she actually wanted to keep these treasures for me." When Lu Changxang heard this, he shook his head with amusement, "You brat, but Mom is right. Isn't it a bit too ostentatious for me to wear such good clothes when I have so little strength?" Luu agreed after thinking about it, "Yes, there's a little bit of that. It's fine in Blue Star, but if it's somewhere else, it's a different story."

Lu Changxang nodded and casually handed Luu a small dark blue bead, saying, "This is for you." Luu asked curiously, "What is this?" It was a pretty little bead, an illusion bead. Lu Changxang explained, "It can change the external form of a supreme treasure or heavy treasure while concealing the aura of the supreme treasure or heavy treasure." Luu tried it, and the original supreme and heavy treasure suit suddenly transformed into casual attire, and their aura completely disappeared. It worked, and Luu's eyes lit up, "This is convenient." Lu Changxang nodded.

Lu Changxang continued, "In fact, changing the outer form and hiding the breath, these supreme and heavy treasures could have done that. However, your realm is too low, and you are unable to fully control these supreme and heavy treasures, which is why you need to temporarily use the illusion bead to do so." Luu nodded. Lu Changxang thought for a moment and said, "Come with me. I'll show you something good." Luu agreed, and they soon arrived at a classical architectural attic.

Lu Changxang revealed, "The spies I told you about earlier have all been caught. Most of them are opportunistic people who secretly leaked your breakthrough live broadcast as a way to gain high profits. However, some real spies were also caught, and many dirty and sorted things were found out. Pulling these people out reduces a lot of future troubles, so you've taken credit for it."

Lu Changxang continued, "In addition, the matter of promoting the great unification of the human race has been deliberated upon and reached a result. The major clans of the great Saimin are willing to push for a great unification of the human race if you are willing to become the master of 138 of those planets." Luu was a bit confused. Lu Changxang explained further, "Promote the completion of the great unification of the human race. The difficulty of this task is high. If the resistance comes from outside, it's okay to address it. Those small countries, in the end, cannot use their arms as big legs. A little use of tactics can make them comply. However, the resistance is from within. Dasha has not been willing to take these small countries to play with, treating others as boiling goats and sheep, and after utilizing them, they will give a slight fly in the ointment. So, in order to accomplish this task..." Luu thought for a while. The price for completing this task was becoming the master of 138 poorly located and harsh environment planets constantly threatened by alien races. Luu understood that this was a liability, not a benefit. Once he took over these planets, he had to take on that responsibility. Pop had already taken care of it, and now Luu had to fulfill his part.

Even though he was still young, he couldn't be held responsible without having to go over there for the time being. But when he grew up, he would have to take responsibility for these 138 planets. 138 planetary Lords might have been Majestic on the surface, but in reality, the pressure was like a mountain or a sea. There were constant headaches of war, and if you didn't carelessly fall to a planet, countless lives would be lost as a result. If the entire defense line collapsed at that time, not to mention his 138 planets being in danger, even the entire human Frontier would be in crisis. A burden of this magnitude couldn't be borne by the average person. It's conceivable that almost every day was spent walking on thin ice and not seeing the other side at all. Sure, if Luu didn't want to, he could also refuse as the son of the Marshall Sage. He had the power to refuse and not take the responsibility.
Luu listened to his old man and understood the key. It's him who's thinking simply, but Luu still raised his head. "I am willing to become the Lord of these 138 planets."
You don't have to be in such a hurry to agree," Lu Chang Shing shook his head. "You don't know how heavy this responsibility really is. You need to think carefully before giving your answer."
I've thought it through," Lou said seriously. "Of course, I know how great this responsibility is, and that Ordinary People simply cannot bear it. But I am the son of a marshall Saint and will be the second Marshal Saint in the future. So, it is my due obligation to share these responsibilities for my father."
As the son of a marshall Saint, he stood at the end of the line for others. That being the case, it is only natural to take on this responsibility.
"Lou, you didn't think at all that there was anything wrong with that?"
Hearing this, Lu Changqing smiled and nodded. "Good. Truly worthy of being my son."
The mission was completed surprisingly simple. Luu did almost nothing and it was successfully completed by hugging his old man's thigh alone. Also, he got 138 planets by accident. It's certainly a responsibility, but it's also a real benefit. Although it was definitely a lot worse compared to those Rich planets in Dasha, it was at least a living planet. In the future, if Lu you wanted to make a big splash, then these 138 planets were considered the best rear base. It has to be built properly, making a fortress of Steel in the meantime.
On the system interface, Mission prompts also appear one after another. The first stage of the mission has been completed, and the evil beheading sword technique has been issued. The second stage of the mission has been completed, and the Chenu and Treasure Pearls have been issued.
The evil sword rank seventh quality perfect type battle technique effect is a sword technique that specializes in restraining the evil spirits category and possesses a strange effect on the evil spirits and psychic energy races. Description: It is rumored to have come from the hands of the ancient evil beheading toist priests, and although the grade is not too high, the effect is quite good. If you make a move at a critical time, it may have an unexpected effect.
The Pearl of Chinin rank eighth quality excellent type special item effect is used as a container. It has an incomparably vast space within it, capable of containing mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Description: The treasure Pearl is named after Chuin and is rumored to be able to contain both Heaven and Earth. The actual effect is obviously not that good, but it's already quite good. The only drawback is that life forms cannot enter it.
Lu looked at the rewards of this Mission, and his eyes lit up. Whether it's the evil beheading sword technique or the Chinin Treasure Pearl, it's all relatively good, especially the latter. In this world, there were similar items, and some Marshall Emperors who had comprehended the rules of space would create items such as spatial rings and nacreous bracelets. However, the materials that could withstand the space could be absolutely extraordinary. This also leads to the fact that these types of items are very precious, and the space that can hold things is usually not particularly large.
This Chenu Treasure Pearl, which could hold rivers, lakes, and seas, how terrifying was it? The only drawback was that it couldn't take in life forms. Otherwise, it would be its own little world. But that's normal if it could be incorporated into life.
Inside the Yagang Pavilion, a high-octane group of people had a good time with the wine. Lou was undoubtedly the center of attention at this moment. He was talking about breaking into the Reincarnation Tower, and everyone listened attentively to his bragging. No, it's no longer bragging because he had really broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, becoming the Undisputed number one in the universe.
In the past, with his talent, he might have had hopes of becoming a marshall Emperor. But now, the starting point is the Marshall Emperor. There was only one goal, and that was the Marshall Saint. After he finished breaking through to the ninth floor and meeting his opponent from an unknown number of reincarnations ago, which horse you won, Luu slowly stood up and, under everyone's gaze, with just a thought, the heavy treasure paired with the Supreme treasure set appeared in front of the eyes of the great summer group.
Wad Dash, the crowd immediately stared with white eyes and subconsciously exclaimed in awe.

At this time, even Xuang, who had three Marshal Emperors from one clan and a distinguished life, was stunned by their beauty. Although their vision was limited, they could not accurately gauge the grade of this group of children, but they could see that these were extraordinary items. Lu, the eldest brother, although his eyesight was limited, understood that this equipment was undoubtedly extraordinary, certainly not just ordinary treasures. Was this the Supreme Treasure obtained from The Reincarnation Tower? Yu Guan Qing, who was providing comic relief, hurriedly asked, fearing that his lines would be stolen. Lu nodded and smiled, saying, "This is the White Jade Wind and Fire Wheel and the Dragon Scale Battle Armor, both Supreme Treasures obtained from the Reincarnation Tower. As for the other pairings, they are extremely heavy treasures, specially given to me by my teacher to honor me. I originally did not want them, but he insisted, saying that I was a meritorious member of the human race and that this was a reward I deserved. Even though I did not accept them, I felt so embarrassed that I could only reluctantly accept them."

In the Heavenly Pivot Court, Lu Chang Xiang sat at the head, with martial Emperors and martial Kings on either side. The crowd had gathered specifically to congratulate the Marshal Sage. At this moment, they were all gathered around Lu Chang Xiang, their envy overflowing compared to the descendants of the old Continental Elders. Those descendants were truly a difference between the clouds and mud, and there was no way to compare them. They had just ascended to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, and all of them had broken through the posture of the tenth realm. Two Marshall Saints from one clan—this was not only a good story for the human race but would also shock the 10,000 races in the universe, making those foreign races and evil gods have a hard time sleeping and eating. This was the fortune of Great Siah, this was the fortune of the human race.

Lu Chang Xiang listened to the compliments from the many Marshal Emperors and martial Kings and nodded his head, saying with emotion, "I did not expect him to be so accomplished, having taken on so much. I deeply know the pressure one has to bear in this position. This brat is still too accomplished, actually giving me such a surprise without saying a word. Breaking into the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower and becoming the target of all the races in the universe is really not what I wished for. I only hoped that he would be free of disasters and grow all the way to Marshal Emperor. Growing all the way up to Marshal Emperor would do." The crowd was speechless for a while, but when they heard this, they realized that Li Ching, as the first Marshal Saint of the human race and the backbone of the human race, was qualified to say this. The people advised Lu Chang Xiang not to worry too much, as the descendants would have their own blessings, and the future was in the hands of these young people. Since Luu had such natural talent, it would naturally be better for him to become the second Marshal Saint of the human race.

Lu Chang Xiang listened to the crowd's words but shook his head. "It's not so simple to become a Marshal Saint, even though this kid has outstanding natural talent. It's simply impossible to rely on this amount of natural talent to become a Marshal Saint; it's too far off. Back then, when the human race was about to be overthrown, I faced the strongest of the 10,000 races in the universe, one evil god after another, and managed to save the day, killing all the way until the 10,000 races were emboldened. The Spirit Light Divine clan, the absolute Divine son claimed to come out once in 10,000 years, in front of me, was subdued and killed in just three moves. The evil God Clan's favored Lord, spreading terror on planet after planet, is still being smashed by me. There are simply not too many deeds like that for me to remember. Now that my incompetent has only broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, thinking of a Marshal Saint as a goal is tantamount to a Fool's dream. After all, the Reincarnation Tower without a life and death crisis can only be considered a game of breaking and entering, and it can only be said that the little guy's talent is indeed good."

The crowd listened to Lu Chang Xiang's words and agreed. Talking about those things in the past, they had all participated in these battles in the beginning, witnessing Lu Chang Xiang's rise to the top, so they could be said to empathize with him. Just as the crowd was chatting furiously, a handsome man dressed in white quietly left the table. Not long after, he was found by Yu Ya and respectfully shouted, "Sister Aha." Yu Ya nodded and casually asked, "Why did you come back to the Blue Star?" Li said, "My little nephew actually broke into the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, causing the 10,000 Clans to boil. After such a big event, can I not come back to take a look? This kid does have some skills; he almost turned the sky upside down." Yu Ya nodded and said, "You're right. Now he's playing with his little friend."

At the Yawang Pavilion, you can go and take a look, but it's best not to disturb them. I understand. Ba nodded. Outside the Yao Guang Pavilion, Ba concealed his figure and looked inside. He saw a scene that left him dumbfounded. Little Luu was narrating the story of the Reincarnation Tower, surrounded by a crowd. "It's a pity that when I broke into the first realm of the Reincarnation Tower, I was so engrossed in seclusion that I accidentally missed the time to break in. Otherwise, that first place would have been mine. Where would it be the turn of that Neptune Prince? That's all, and it gave him the illusion of declaring war on me three times. It's ridiculous! As soon as the second realm Reincarnation Tower begins, I'll kill him in seconds and let him know how ridiculous he really is."

On the side, there was also comic relief. He had also broken into the Reincarnation Tower. "Knowing that the 10,000 races are the pride of the heavens, how powerful they are, this was more than enough to set off Luu's extraordinary performance all the way through."

"Big Brother, tell me more about breaking through to the ninth floor," someone spoke up.

When Luu heard this, he smiled slightly and continued, "Thinking back then, my unproductive Marshall Saint old man was able to break through to the ninth floor. I still naturally have no problem with it. However, this is indeed somewhat difficult. I was on the eighth floor and met another me."

Ba's face was stunned, especially when he heard that his "unproductive Marshall Saint old man." He was even more shocked. "Good boy, this is really like father, like son."

Accompanied by Luu's narration, a burst of exclamations after another could be described as one after another. A group of children's brothers and sisters at this moment looked at Luu with eyes full of admiration and worship. Prior to this, there were actually quite a few of this group of children who were not convinced by Luu. Not all of them would be bluffed by a few words. That was precisely why the partner approved task had dragged on for so long in the first place, not being completed until the end of the Tower of Trials. However, at this moment, when Luu finished breaking into the Reincarnation Tower, everyone without exception was convinced of Luu. Second in the first realm, first in the second realm, his fame shook the universe, and all the races were boiling. Even their Marshall Emperor, Marshall King, mom, and dad were full of praise for Luu, lamenting that this kind of talent was truly unparalleled.

After finishing the matter of the Reincarnation Tower, Luu talked about his uncovering of the spies of the human race as well as pushing for the great unification of the human race. This thing, the movement is not small, the people are slightly heard, but one also did not expect is actually a big brother to promote. Amidst the crowd's inspiring gazes, Luu continued, "In recognition of my achievements, I have become the owner of 138 living planets."

When these words came out, a group of kid brothers immediately stared with wide eyes. "Oh my God, 138 living planets, big brother, you're directly commanding 138 planets, that's awesome!" Because of this news, it was so overwhelming that some people couldn't even believe it. "Is this true?"

"When have I ever told a lie?" Luu glanced at the man. "Whether it's true or not, you'll all know if you go and ask around."

The words came out, and Xuang immediately said, "I know this matter, it is indeed true."

The crowd was stunned. Luu smiled and continued, "In fact, my Marshall Saint father at first didn't agree with me becoming the master of these 138 planets. Do you know why?"

Chapter 131: The Future, Going to War Together

Inside the Yagang Pavilion, a group of children listened to Luu's narration in extraordinary quiet. The moment Luu said this, before the crowd could react, Yuanin grabbed the question. "Big Brother, why?"

Luu nodded and continued, "Because these 138 living planets are located in remote and harsh environments. However, that's not the point. What's the key?" Luu glanced at the crowd before speaking. "The key is that these planets, close to the Starfield Battlefield, have to be infested by foreign races from time to time. Once you take over my 138 living planets, it means taking on this burden. These are not rich planets of life but a frontline battlefield. So my dad naturally doesn't want me to agree. There's no doubt about it, it's a big pain in the ass, a big liability. But for the sake of the human race, for the sake of the great cause, how can I back down? If I don't take this burden, who will? Who will?"

When these words came out, the crowd was all excited, with their hearts pounding and their blood surging. A long time ago, at the banquet, Luu often opened his mouth and bragged about all kinds of things, and at that time, many people disdained this, thinking that Luu was thinking too simply. After the passage of time, after hearing these words again, after hearing Luu's bold words for himself at the beginning and starting to put them into action, how could he not be moved by them?

Luu looked at the complex expressions of the crowd and continued, "These things, as the son of the Marshall Saint, I am obligated to do, and these planets just happen to be my rear bases for my conquest of the foreign races. So to me, these 138 planets are..."

Here is the text with English errors corrected and maintained the original meaning:

Not troublesome or burdensome at all, but the best kind of help, as soon as these words came out, someone exclaimed excitedly, "Big Brother, I'm willing to follow you to these 138 planets and conquer the foreign races together!" Yuban Ching's reaction was half a beat slower, and when he saw that someone had jumped ahead of him, it was too late for him to catch up, and he hurriedly shouted, "I am also willing to follow big brother and conquer the foreigners!" "Big brother, I'm willing, I'm going to go with you to the battlefield together," "Big brother, I want to be with you in the battle against the foreigners too." My family has three Marshall Emperors, and two of them died in battle for our great cause; how can I be missing out on something like this?" You just don't understand—my family won't allow it!" The other little friends scrambled to be the first, fearing that they would be left behind and wanted to follow Luu to one of the battlefields to conquer the foreigners. Luu was very pleased to hear these words; it seems that none of these sons of the powerful and noble families are foolish people. The most basic loyalty is still there. But he didn't have the idea of luring these people into a trap all at once. Luu shook his head and said, "This matter of great importance is by no means a trivial matter. I appreciate the good intentions of all of you, but battlefield conquests and fighting against foreigners are all about facing the mouth of a knife and dealing with death; if one is not careful, it will be a path of death. If you really have this in mind, you'd better go home and talk to your elders, listen to what they think, and then come back and answer me." The crowd nodded seriously.

In the meantime, outside the Ywang Pavilion, Byang's jaw dropped to the ground in shock when he heard the conversation inside. A living being with 138 lives, this young man who was going to join the battlefield in the future? The most outrageous thing is that this still seems to be true, but does she know about this? Why did he agree? Byang looked at Luu with a mixture of expressions—That old man of yours is a fool, and you're fooling around with him too. Those 138 planets are basically war zones, and they're counting on you to protect them. By throwing this mess at you, they're counting on you. Can you understand that those families—since you broke through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower and have the posture of a Martial Saint, they can't wait to burden you! Byang's heart was filled with annoyance, and he was even angrier that his aunt knew all about this, but I didn't.

Lycha glared at the handsome man in the room. It was definitely this guy who snitched on me. Who is he? Lu, I tried to pull away from the conversation. "Your uncle, we met once when you were a year old," he said with a smile. Lu nodded. "Uncle, I don't see you anymore." "You didn't cut your hair, did you?" Luu nodded. "It's done, don't interrupt." By glanced at Bay, and under the bloodline suppression, Bay's hallowed Marshall Emperor was momentarily silenced. "What do you mean by that, exactly?" Byu asked Luu, looking at him once again. "Mom, unless I grow up for the rest of my life, there will be a day when I have to step into the battlefield and face the enemy. A day when I have to go to the front lines." "Is that possible?" Luu opened his mouth. "Then why did you hide it from me?" Byu continued to ask.

I don't know, don't you know? Luu saw his mom's face wasn't right, and quickly reassured him. "I must tell you next time." 

In the meantime, when that group of powerful sons and daughters went home and said that they were going to those 138 living planets to join the war, there was no doubt about it. It was called a chicken and dog fight—everyone was allowed to go. However, Marshal Emperor Chuan Hong narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "Why am I not allowed to go?" Xuang stood up agitatedly, his face red with anger. "My Chew family has three Marshall Emperors, and two of them died in battle. Have we become cowards when it comes to me? Didn't you say before that you wanted me to move around more with the Marshall Saints, son? Why are you going back on your word now? I asked you to strike a good relationship with that Lu, not for me to go into battle with him." Chuan Hong frowned and said faintly, "If we don't go to the battlefield together, fight and live and die together, where is there any good relationship?" Xuang retorted excitedly, "If everyone else goes and I don't, isn't that a disgrace to the Chu family?" It's fine for you to join the war with him, but it's absolutely not fine for you to give him your life." Chuan Hong shook his head. "You are no longer a child, don't you know the difference? He's bound to be a Marshall Saint in the future, what's wrong with me following him?"

Like this amount of merit, it's just a matter of future conquest for those planets. It's not as if we're going to go now, could it be that this can't even be promised? Chuyang stared wide-eyed, his eyes filled with disappointment. Chapter 132: Big Brother is really awesome, new Mainline Quest. No way, no don't think about this. There are knots to untangle.

Shuan Hong said it indifferently, "Me, I'm going." Xuang was so angry that his eyes turned red. He raised his head and stubbornly shouted, "I must follow Big Brother. You can't stop it!" Shuan Hong heard this and shot a headache through his head. He couldn't help but rub his brow. How did things go in this direction before? It was he who had united with a few other great SE lineages to count on the Marshall Saint as well as his youngest son.

The Marshall Saint's son, who had shown such amazing talent in The Reincarnation Tower, would at the very least be an emperor in the future. He must be allowed to take on more responsibilities. Who could have known that he was going to take his own foolish son and go with him to that star realm to fight against the alien race? There's no way that's agreeable. Calculating the success of the son of the Marshall Saint, he had been in a mood that could be described as very good. But what did he know? In a turn of an eye, his home was stolen. Numb people are numb. That's really lifting a rock and stoning yourself. Not all clans agreed with their own sons and daughters accompanying Luu in the future to fight together. Most of the families for the most part were in agreement. That's because they were already close to the Marshall Saint and because this matter was in the future, and it was only a verbal agreement.

There were still a lot of variables. Only a handful of martial arts families when they heard their own children say this, were then double-tongued. It's not that they fought for this condition by confronting the Marshall Saint's elder Hadon. They didn't give in at all. But you don't want your own child foolishly to follow one and then the next. Numb. Turning to the next day, once again, the Gathering of Luu's Little Friends gleefully gave a reply. The family agreed to go to those planets together in the future to fight against the alien race. But there were quite a few people who didn't come. Xuang was absent, and there was also the little fat Pinan, who came. Yanching immediately snorted coldly. These guys are all gutless rats. They talk pretty but in reality, they don't dare to come. That's it. Don't bring them to play in the future.

The surrounding crowd in righteous indignation agreed, "I don't think so." Luu directly shook his head. They're not like that. It must be because their family doesn't agree and still won't let them go out. That's why they didn't come over. Then they didn't say anything in the group. Yaning said it should be because they don't know how to face us. Luu thought for a moment and said, "Just make contact." Saying so, Luu directly contacted these absentees. As they looked at Luu, each one of them was incomparably ashamed. "Big Brother, my dad doesn't agree," said the little chubby Pirin Yun.

Shamefully, he directly grounded himself and forbade himself from coming over to play. "My dad grounded me too," said Shu Young in a hurry. "So are we, Big Brother, what should we do?" This one with a tiny face was full of aggravation. When the crowd saw this scene, they realized that they had really misunderstood and that things were indeed as Big Brother had said. There's no one who is gutless. It's just that their family doesn't agree. But if that's the case, then it can't be helped. After all, that was the decision of the elders and the family. So, how could they change it? There's nothing else to be done about it. But unexpectedly, Luu smiled and said, "Don't worry about it. I will personally convince your family members. As long as I explain the stakes to them, they will definitely agree."

"Dad, Luu," Lu Chong Chen said, "something's wrong." Lu Chong Chen glanced at him. "It's like this, Lu. You told the cause and effect of the matter roughly." When Lu Chang Chang heard these words, he couldn't help but be a bit surprised and couldn't help but glance at Luu. "Good boy, is this intentional or unintentional on your part?" Luu's smile was a surprise to everyone, and the sons of those families all looked at each other, dragged down. Not a single one got away. All of them will follow Luu, nice Skylord.

These martial arts families had really lifted a stone and smashed their own feet. It was indeed foolish to think that they could live long without following Luu. Lu Chang Ching smiled and said, "This is a small matter. Just leave it to me. Don't worry, I will convince people with reason." Luu nodded, then, "I'll trouble Dad." It would be foolish to go over there on your own when you have the thigh of the Marshall Saint's old man and don't mess with it. There are no surprises. It was a matter that was easily resolved.

Good times are fleeting, as the teacher had only granted him a three-day break to rest. Today marked the third day, and tomorrow it was time to resume martial arts training. Despite his initial resistance, Luu understood that strengthening himself was the right thing to do, given his lineage as the son of a marshall. However, if the human race was truly under attack from an external threat, it seemed odd that people were still following him.

Just then, a light screen appeared before Luu's eyes, lifting his spirits. The system mission had arrived. It had been a long time since the last mission, during which Luu had successfully captured the traitor of the human race and promoted the great unification of the human race by merging and integrating all countries.

However, Luu knew that this was not enough. The external danger to the human race had not decreased in the slightest. As the saying goes, "No egg is left intact when the nest is overturned."

Next, Luu was tasked with recovering a living planet that originally belonged to the human race. The reward for this mission was a Jade bone pill (stage two). Recovering five living planets would earn him a God defining bead (stage three), and recovering ten living planets would reward him with the Thunder fire seal (stage four). The ultimate goal was to recover 50 living planets, for which the reward was the Golden Crow Jade plate.

Looking at the system, Luu furrowed his brows. The rewards for the quest were certainly enticing, but the difficulty was a bit too high. Recovering a planet that was once owned by mankind seemed like an impossible task, especially since he was only three years old.

He let out a subconscious sigh, and Xuang immediately asked, "Why are you sighing, you Guing? You're stealing my lines again."

Luu pondered for a moment before speaking. "As far as I know, our human race at its peak once possessed more than a thousand living planets. Unfortunately, as the 10,000 races of the universe pressed on the war defenses of the human race, these life planets fell one after another. Now, there are only close to a thousand life planets left. There are still many humans in those fallen life planets who didn't have time to evacuate and have long since fallen into captivity and slavery of the foreigners, imprisoned for generations and working forever."

The crowd fell silent, and the originally cheerful and relaxed atmosphere instantly became gloomy. No one had thought that Luu was even thinking about these things.

"The 138 life planets under my control today are located in the Taiway star domain, which is very close to these life planets that once belonged to humans," Luu continued. "I want to recapture these planets, but it's just too hard, and I'm so young. Pop would never allow me to be in the battlefield. On top of that, I'm afraid that the soldiers in general stationed on these living planets won't trust my command, much less easily follow my dispatch. I want to keep making big moves, preferably to recapture those living planets, but I don't know what to do or where to start. I wonder, gentlemen, what's the best way to do this?"

Luu looked at the crowd, and the guys couldn't help but look at each other. The question was a little too over the top for them, but since Luu was so farsighted and so worried about the country, they absolutely couldn't be left behind.

Immediately afterward, this group of young brothers conferred with each other. There was no doubt that in these deliberated plans were mostly whimsical schemes, the kind that sounded outrageous on first hearing. Just then, the little chubby pirin Yun inhaled his nose, hesitated for a moment, but still opened his mouth and said, "Big brother, why do you ask about blindness? The moment these words came out, the surrounding crowd first froze and then glared angrily. What does it mean to ask the blind, you say that we are all working in unison to give Big Brother ideas, although the bad ideas are on the side, but at least they are their own thoughts. How can you say such things? This is not pouring cold water on everyone."

Luu turned his head to look at Chin Yu Li and opened his mouth to ask, "Do you have any ideas, Shin yunai?"

Shin yunai said seriously, "Our deliberation here is tantamount to talking on paper. Even if we give the best ideas and come up with the best plans, but once we get to the front line and actually use them, it's a different matter. Big Brother, your teacher Xiaoen hang is the former Chief Marshall of Diaa with such a great God around. What is the reasoning for not going to ask him for his thoughts and suggestions, and in turn asking those of us who haven't been on the battlefield where can we get a solution to the problem?"

As the crowd listened to Chin yuli's words, although they were tempted to retort, upon closer examination, this was really the case. Xuyang immediately said, "What, we should ask Xiaoen hang for his thoughts and suggestions?"

The crowd nodded in agreement. Luu turned to Xuang and said, "Good idea. I'll go ask him now."

And so, Luu went to find Xiaoen hang to discuss the best way to recapture the fallen life planets and save the humans trapped within them.

Chin Yun stated, "It makes sense that it's difficult for us to discuss a method, even after half a day's discussion. At most, we can unite our families and support the frontline battlefields as a way to recover the lost planets. However, if it were Marshall Xiao who made the move, then everything would be different."

Yuguan Ching hurriedly agreed, "I also feel that this is the truth. As long as Sword Emperor Jaia is willing to come out, then nothing is a problem."

Master Luu ran over with gusto and asked with a smile, "Haven't seen you for 3 days. Did Master miss me?"

Jaia Wanan narrowed his eyes at Luu, "What do you want me to do?"

Luu replied, "It's not about what I want. I can tell at a glance that you're needed. Here's the deal." Luu smiled somewhat embarrassedly and then roughly explained the matter.

After listening for a long time, Jaia Wanan nodded and said faintly, "So you want to ask me to come out and be the chief Marshall of those 138 planets?"

Luu nodded vigorously, but Jaia Wanan shook his head, "Not interested."

Luu was a bit dumbfounded. Master's rejection was too dry. He didn't even consider it at all. "I'm still recuperating from my injuries and my strength hasn't recovered to its peak stage. Once I go down, those foreigners will surely go down with even more powerful characters as well, and it'll be a bit unpleasant then. So, from all considerations, I can't go down for the time being."

Xiao Wuan glanced at Luu and explained, "Okay, I know that this matter is not that simple. You don't need to be in too much of a hurry."

Jaia Wanan said indifferently, "As a commander, the most taboo thing to do is to be too anxious. You need to remain calm at all times, even if countless people are dying every minute and every second. You still need to remain calm because any hasty decision you make could cause the situation to completely fall apart."

"If you're really interested in the afternoon's military class, we can deduce the battlefield situation over there, and I'll explain it to you properly. Although I don't know why Luu is so interested in recovering the planet, since he has said so, there is no reason why I wouldn't explain and do something for him. Just in time to use this as a textbook."

Xiao Wuan, who hadn't been to class for a while, was feeling a bit itchy. When Luu heard this, his eyes lit up. "Good, though I wasn't able to get the master to come out, the master can stand behind himself and advise him. So the effect is pretty much the same."

However, he's obviously thinking about things in a simplistic way. "Stupid, how could I have a disciple like you with your kind of command? You still think of recovering the lost lands of the human race. Do your spring and fall dream. Obviously, the cultivation talent is so good. How come when it comes to the military command above, it's stupid like this? You're even dumber than Jiia, the current commander-in-chief of the Taiway Starfield, to venture out without even the most basic understanding of the big picture. I think you don't even know how to write the word death."

This series of reprimands scolded Luu, who was a little confused. "How spirited he was when he broke into The Reincarnation Tower, and how stifled he was now, as if everything he did was wrong. Master, how could the commanders of these foreign races be as powerful as you? Luu really couldn't hold back and retorted, "Is it do you think so?"

Hearing this, Xiao Wuan narrowed his eyes and said, "To tell you the truth, within the foreign races, those who are stronger than me can be said to abound. You're underestimating those Cosmic Celestial Pride. If you still want to recover the lost planet for the human race, if you can't even win against me, I advise you to dismiss this unrealistic thought before it's too late."

Luu gritted his teeth again, but Xiao Wuan shook his head, "It's not coming. It'll be the same again. It's really foolish. Well, let me explain to you about the Taiway Starfield war zone and the recent war events that have taken place."

Almost all of Luu's 138 life planets were in the Taiway Starfield war zone. The highest commander in charge of this area was called Xiia Marshall Emperor realm, also a Dasha person. In Luu's Dasha hero circle, there was a Xi now who was this person's own son. Even though this Starfield, these planets didn't belong to Grand Siabi before this, it didn't prevent Grania's Army from being stationed over here, commanding the entire Starfield War Zone from here.

One could see why those martial arts families in Diaa did not agree to annex these small countries to complete the great unification of the human race. Military, political, and financial three aspects of power can be said to be firmly in the hands of only eat the benefits. Do not want to be bad. Why do you still want to cut the meat out of it?

Even though Luu had become the nominal master of these 138 planets, it didn't mean that whatever he said here was what he said. Military, political, and financial three powers still by the upper echelons of Dasha firmly grasping it. Need to slowly go to fight for him. As he continued to go deeper and deeper, Luu gradually realized that the situation here could be described as intricate and complicated to the extreme. Each party has their own side of the interests. In the multiple constraints, the situation formed a delicate balance. Once Luu intervened, the balance is bound to be broken. The situation will develop in another direction. Whether it would be...

At that time, whether one was good or bad depended on Luu's personal ability and the war situation. Jia Wuan also explained the general situation of the Taiway Star Domain to Luu. Despite being an Idol and former Chief Marshal of Dashia, Jia Wuan's intelligence channels were not insignificant. Under his explanation, Luu gained a rough understanding of the situation of these 1

No one can replace you; I have my teacher, Xia Onean, the former Marshall of the Grand Sia, who can fully take your place. After serving in the Taiway Star Domain for years, you can't even recover the lost human planet if you don't feel ashamed. I still feel ashamed. How dare you still interfere in others' affairs? From now on, I'm the boss of the Taiway Starfield; just listen to me. Don't underestimate me because of my youth. Be careful; I won't take your son to play with me in the future. Act properly. (Chapter 135)

Who is that Luu? Although Xiia thinks highly of himself, he's not the reckless type who got where he is today. How could it be that simple for a Marshall Emperor? Arrogance, superiority, and headstrongness are just superficial illusions. When Xiia glanced at the email, he couldn't help but fall silent, staring at the text. This email, especially the last threat, "Be careful; I won't take your son to play in the future," was extremely comical, making the entire email absurd.

Before this, the Marshall Saint's only son, Luu, had broken through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. Ji G was aware of such a significant event. This kind of genius, not just for the entire human community but even in the entire universe of the 10,000 races, is rare. After realizing Luu had taken over the 138 living planets in the Taiway Astral Domain, Ji G didn't care much until this email arrived. He was left speechless.

After some time, Ji G called his youngest son, "Dad." The youngest son, Myriad, looked up with surprise. Ji G asked, "I want to ask you, what kind of person is Luu?" XA Yuan, Ji G's other son, asked curiously. Ji G directly asked, "What do you think?"

Jauan, the youngest son, replied without hesitation, "Big brother is a hero." Hearing this, XI GF raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why do you say that?" Jauan explained, "In the near future, big brother will lead us to change the universe, suppress all the races, and make a great cause never seen before."

Ji G, surprised by his son's words, remained silent for a while. Jauan noticed his father's reaction and asked, "Dad, don't you believe it?" Ji G nodded, questioning how he could believe such a thing. Jauan continued, "You might think that big brother, being so young, is just making empty promises. However, big brother is truly walking on this path with determination. There are many things he has done that I can't even count."

Jauan shared Luu's recent actions, such as discovering spies while breaking into the Reincarnation Tower and pushing for the great unification of the entire human race. Jauan's admiration for his brother was evident in his eyes. Ji G couldn't deny Luu's maturity and achievements. Jauan reminded his father, "You can't treat him like a little kid; he's much more mature than we are."

Ji G realized that his son had not been fooled and that Luu was indeed powerful. He asked Jauan to tell him more about Luu's specific actions. Jauan obliged, recounting Luu's glorious deeds to his father. Despite his young age, Luu had been making significant contributions.

He stepped into the Dasha cabinet to listen to the cabinet members deliberating on important matters. It's amazing enough to listen to politics, even if it's not your thing. Who would have thought he'd even step in to solve the Hing Peril at the same time? Luu studied The Art of War with former Marshall Xia Wuan, and even Xiao Wuan marveled at his military talent, which was very impressive, no less than his martial arts talent. The subsequent opening of The Reincarnation Tower was even more of a triumph, displaying a heaven-defying martial arts talent.
Ja Mea Yuan rambled on for a long time as Xi Gia listened. His face grew more and more brilliant. Originally, he thought that Luu, no matter how much of a genius he was, was only a three-year-old child and could not possibly meddle in the affairs of the Thaway Star Domain. "I'm afraid that doesn't seem to be the case now," he said.
One of the things that my stupid son has said the most is, "His big brother always does what he says. Words will be honored. Actions will be taken."
Jai then thought of the email he had written to himself. One of the most vicious words was, "Don't think you are unique and no one can replace you." He can replace the former Marshall of Dasha at any time. Just now, Jai G hadn't taken that to heart. Now, it seems, if Marshall Xia was willing, then this matter was not impossible to happen.
After Jauan finished speaking, he looked at his dad. "By the way, big brother asked me to forward the mail today. What did he say to you?"
Jai shook his head. "Just a simple exchange of pleasantries."
"Oh, Jai," Xi Gia said, nodding. "Now, you and Luu..."
Jai shook his head. "No, this matter isn't that simple."
Bayu ya glanced at Luu and said indifferently, "You just took first place in The Reincarnation Tower. Don't you know how famous you are now? How dare you go out of the blue star at this time? Wait until you grow up a bit. I can ask my teacher to take me there. Off my teacher is a marshall Emperor."
What danger can this be? Lou you perked up, still wanting to fight for a second. That won't do. You're too young. I'm not worried by yuyo refused again.
Then wouldn't it be fine if you followed alone, Luu said.
"No means no," Bayu ya shook her head.
Just one trip to The Reincarnation Tower, and you've hardened your wings. Do you know how many evil gods are staring at you? Don't even think about it, Luu.
Nodding helplessly, Luu said, "Okay, it does seem a bit risky. In that case, I can only wait for Pops to return and discuss it. And let Pops take me there. That would definitely be no problem."
After leaving Mom's side, Luu unexpectedly realized that he had received a friend request. The other party was, of course, the general commander of the Taiway Starfield Legion, Die G.
Chapter 136: Is There Really a Capable Person Born to Know Whom?
Luu saw this friend application and couldn't help but be a little surprised. Could it be that he had scolded this guy sharply? Actually, Luu hadn't wanted to use his power to oppress people. But since this shy G is not a proper person, he can't be blamed, and that's the way it has to be when dealing with this kind of pride. You're arrogant and bossy, so I'll be even more arrogant and bossy than you. The only way to communicate better is to overpower the other person. Otherwise, the other party is above the eyeballs and won't even look at you as a little friend.
Admittedly, Luu's status was top-notch, and his talent was unparalleled. But the problem was that he hadn't grown up yet. After all, he was still too small. Why should others put you in their eyes? So reasoning certainly doesn't make sense. It can only be done this way—a little too aggressively.
Seeing this friend request at the moment, Luu thinks the guy might be red War anxious. But after a moment's thought, he accepted it. Go on. That's absolutely no way to wimp out.
After accepting the friend application, Luu even took the initiative and made a communication call. Soon, the communication call was connected, and looking at the figure on the opposite side, Luu smiled and asked, "You are Uncle Xi whom it's definitely not a wimp. Instead, it's a right of passage and a division."
Hearing this very polite address, Ja Mea Yuan was a bit surprised as he narrowed his eyes and carefully sized up the kid in front of him.
"You're L Wish's son?" Luu asked.
"Yes, my name is Lou U," Luu replied.
"Louu, why did you send an email to bully me?" Ja Gia asked calmly.
"Bullying?" Luu shook his head. "This is good advice. It's not bullying at all. I just hope to make you do not make a mistake. I know more about the situation in the Taiway Astral Domain than you do. It's not that I don't agree with the great unification of the human race. But this is a matter that doesn't need to be pushed forward so quickly."
Ja Gia slowly said, "There is a priority in everything, and I'm afraid that once it's pushed too far, there will be a great chaos. This is a truth."

I am certain you can understand why I intervened to block it. My intention is for this to progress slowly and steadily. You said those things and expressed a desire for Marshall Xiao to replace me. What else could this be but an attempt to bully me? This is a flawless statement.

Jai knew that the general trend could not be violated, so he did not foolishly resist it. Instead, it means that this matter should be adapted to the local situation and randomized rather than being implemented immediately without regard for timing. Luu found this perfectly sensible.

When Luu heard this, he was stunned. He did not seek to reason with Jia, but Jia sought to reason with him instead. I fear he wouldn't believe me if I told my master about this.

Luu thought for a moment before speaking. "Your judgment may not be accurate." Jai laughed. "I have been in the Taiway Astral Domain for so long. Could it be that my judgment isn't as accurate as yours? That's natural." Luu said rightfully. "Just because you are the son of a Saint Marshall, Jai Gia. That's even more of a put-down."

Luu did not get angry as he raised his head and said seriously, "Of course not. I have roughly understood your recent battle in the Taiway Starfield. There were quite a few problems, and if it wasn't for your blind confidence, there wouldn't have been so many unnecessary casualties, J Gia. It's not this kid. What's wrong with you? Does he know what he's talking about? It's okay to point fingers and stick to your guns on political matters, but how dare he point a finger at the military? This is tantamount to a Class Act and is simply ridiculous."

XI found this somewhat amusing. He really wanted to hear what kind of tall tales the little guy had. Luu was not the least bit polite and directly commented on it, constantly counting down the various problems and faults of Jia. These words were naturally not unintentional but the true insights of Master Xian Yuan. Jia Wuan stood at an absolute height and summarized one question after another. I remembered it clearly, and at this moment, without exception, it was all borrowed by Luu. I know you're not convinced, but you need to change your temper. If you can correct these problems, you can definitely go further and thus recover some human planets. Luu said so. Jia opened his mouth, bewildered. This was written all over that weathered face. Even in his dreams, he had never thought that there was not a single problem with Luu's words. Could it be that there are really capable people who are born knowing how? Can a kid that age have so much insight into what goes on in the battlefield? Is that what geniuses do? For a moment, Jia Gia was a bit skeptical. It wasn't until he hung up the communication video that he reacted with an afterthought. No, these words are definitely not from this kid. Nine times out of ten, it's Marshall Xiao. He's been retired for so long that I actually didn't react for a moment and was bluffed by this kid. Good fellow at this young age, you have used the pulling of the big flag so skillfully. If it weren't for the fact that I am familiar with Marshall Xiao, I would have really been blindsided by him. Is this the new era magnate being so enterprising? It makes me wonder if I'm getting old when he grows up and comes to the Taiway Starfield Battlefield. I'm afraid quite a few interesting things will happen.

J Gia couldn't help but smile, his eyes flashing with a hint of anticipation. Master Luu found Xiao Wuan with gusto. "What is it, Xiao Wuan?" Jia asked. Xiao Wuan glanced at him. "I've already convinced that Jia Luu said you got your dad to step in." Xiao Wuan asked. "Of course not. As I said, this little matter, I only need to make a slight move and casually give it away. It's not a problem at all." Luu said smugly. Oh, Xiao Wuan was a bit surprised but on second thought, this little guy almost always surprised people, so this wasn't particularly surprising. At first, even Jia looked for me to raise an offense, saying that I don't know anything, but I ended up just saying a few words and dismissing him into silence, letting him be convinced of me. Luu rambled on and continued to show off. Hearing the half-truths, Jia Wuan didn't count on the authenticity and still nodded his head in a breezy manner. "Master, why don't you praise me?" Luu asked with a smile. "This is nothing," Xiao Wuan said indifferently. "Okay, Master's standards are as high as ever." Luu nodded. "Then I'll go cultivate. Don't rush." Xiao Wuan shook his head. "I applied for you to enroll in Blue Star University yesterday, and that side has already agreed. So for your cultivation afterward, you can go there first." Ha. Luu was confused. Chapter 137: Blue Star University Triggered the Special Mission. The entry criteria for Blue Star University was to break through to the Marshall Fourth Realm before the age of 18. Luu was only at the Second Realm now and hadn't reached the standard at all. This was clearly a backdoor move. But here's the thing, Luu didn't have much interest in Blue Star University after all. In his opinion, no matter how good the conditions of Blue Star University were, it couldn't compare to the personal.

The Emperor's teachings, Jauan realized, were not about putting the cart before the horse. "You don't think it's necessary to go to Blue Star University when you have my teachings?" Jauan asked, seeing through Luu's thoughts in an instant.

Luu nodded.

"Aha, Luu," Jauan laughed, then slowly said, "Then you're also underestimating Blue Star University. Blue Star University is the top school in the entire human community, a gathering place for countless super geniuses. The ones you defeated in the virtual world's trial battlefield were just some low-level students. In short, the teaching conditions at Blue Star University are absolutely beyond your imagination. Both your father and I graduated from Blue Star University. If Blue Star University were ranked second, no martial arts university would dare to be ranked first."

Hearing these words, Luu couldn't help but say, "Master, you are a Sword Emperor. So what if it's a Sword Emperor?"

Xiao Wuan glanced at Luu and said indifferently, "You have to understand that even if your father came here, he wouldn't be able to compare to a top academy. I didn't intend to let you enter Blue Star University for further studies so soon. It's just that I didn't expect your rate of progress to be so fast. First place in the second realm's Reincarnation Tower. Even if you're still in the second realm now, in terms of strength alone, an ordinary fourth realm isn't even a match for you, and even a fifth realm could have a battle. You're now entering the critical stage of inscription comprehension. It's simply a waste of time to train hard here with me without proper conditions. Blue Star University, on the other hand, has a complete cultivation system that works very well, so it's naturally worth going there."

When Luu heard these words, he couldn't help but fall silent. After a long time, he raised his head and asked, "Master, are you driving me away?"

Xiao Wuan first froze, then couldn't help but laugh. "Naturally, I'm not driving you away. Whether it's swordsmanship or the Art of War, I'll continue to teach you, and you'll have to keep coming over. At the same time, I expect you to go to Blue Star University to further your education."

Luu subconsciously asked, "Right?"

Xiao Wuan nodded.

"This is too tiring," Luu was a bit dumbfounded.

"Isn't your goal to change the heavens and the Earth, clarify the universe, and suppress the 10,000 races of the universe?" Xiao Wuan asked calmly. "This is just where you're at, and you're feeling too tired."

With these words, what else could Luu say? Even if he knocked out his teeth, he had to swallow it in his stomach.

"Blue Star University, right? I want to go to the battlefield. What's a small university? Just go. Who's afraid?"

Looking down from the airship, the megalopolis was extraordinarily spectacular. In this megalopolis, Blue Star University was divided into four areas: the Elite School District (for those who entered the fourth realm before the age of 18), the Genius School District (for those who entered the Golden Body realm before the age of 18), the Demon School District (for those who entered the Dharma Body realm before the age of 18), and a special area where students from any area, regardless of their realm, could enter to cultivate as long as they broke through to the sixth realm and became a patriarch before graduation. Here, a sixth realm patriarch was enough to act as a teacher to teach the new students.

Luu was taken to the Demon School District. The conditions here were undoubtedly one of the best of the three large school districts. At this moment, a seventh realm Grandmaster, who was also a professor from Blue Star University, was standing beside Luu, patiently introducing everything here to him. Although Luu was only at the second realm, he had broken into the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower not long ago and gotten the undisputed first place. This was a solid Marshall Saint stance, even without looking at his Marshall Saint father. This qualification alone was enough to enter Blue Star University for further studies.

"This area where demons gather is called the Jin Shin School District," the old professor said with a smile.

"Why is it called Jin Shin?" Luu subconsciously asked.

"The word Jin Shin is an expectation that when they grow up, they will go and suppress the evil gods of all the races in the universe," the old professor explained.

Luu couldn't help but nod. No doubt about it, the students of the God Suppressing Region were the geniuses of all geniuses and the hope for the future of the human race.

"There aren't many students over here," Luu swept a glance, extraordinarily empty with sparse shadows.

"Very normal," Xiao Wuan nodded. "There are only a handful of people who can enter the Dharma Body realm before the age of 18."

Luu nodded deeply. Mastering inscriptions and stringing them together was difficult indeed. That's why he was open otherwise, it wouldn't have gone so well.

Just then, in front of Luu's eyes, a prompt suddenly appeared, and a line of text slowly emerged:

"Special Mission Triggered: You came to Blue Star University, visited all the things that Blue Star University has to offer, and decided to further your education here for a period of time to further enhance your strength. After all, in terms of your current strength, it's just too difficult to reclaim what was once a human plan."

Here is a polished version of the text while maintaining the original meaning:

If you're not careful, you'll lose your life in this situation. To succeed, you need to be cautious and continuously strive to improve yourself, in addition to learning from your Master. Blue Star University, which has cultivated numerous geniuses, is also a good place to gain some experience. On a mission to gain the approval of 100 classmates, the reward is a Jade Lotus root and a bottle of golden elixir. On a mission to perfect the Dharma body, the ultimate reward is nine turns of a golden elixir. As Luu looked at the quest in front of him, his eyes lit up. He hadn't expected that coming to Blue Star University would lead to such unexpected gains, including a special mission with excellent rewards. Two golden pills, just by hearing their names, felt extraordinary. It seemed that the system also recognized the difficulty of the mission to recover the planet that the humans had lost, and it was a high probability that the special mission would not trigger unless Luu arrived at Blue Star University. This meant that Luu visiting other places and triggering different special quests was a possibility, but it was useless to think about that now, as he was too young to leave the University without his mother's permission. The previous Reincarnation Tower was a one-time exception, and here at Blue Star University, there were certain rules to follow.

Zuo Yuan suddenly said, "The Airship has arrived, and we are in the middle of the wide Square chapter 138." The students were surprised, but Luu commented, "It's Sunday, so why can't we see a single person?" Zacha Gaki laughed and said, "These are big lessons. The so-called great lessons are when Marshall Emperors and Marshall Kings come to give lectures. They show us the way." Luu blinked and said, "But where are the teachers today?" Zacha Gaki replied, "Each student here has been assigned a Manor as a residence, equipped with various service robots and basic cultivation grounds, such as gravity Chambers and meditation Chambers. Most of the students either meditate at home or go to break into the Secret Realm of Trials."

Luu's eyes lit up when he heard about the Secret Realm of Trials and the inscription Slate. He could understand why his Master had insisted that he come to Blue Star University. Luu nodded to Zuo Yuan, who said, "Let's get through the enrollment procedure, and I'll take you on a tour of the University afterwards." The enrollment procedure was completed quickly, and Luu was given a badge with the logo of Blue Star University. 

After he got his hands on it, a light screen popped up, displaying the following message: "Your student code is No. 118. You have been automatically added to the Jinshin District Student Group." The quiet group instantly became lively, with messages welcoming the new students, congratulating them on their enrollment, and asking questions about Luu, the new student. Someone asked if this was the freshman who was also the son of the Marshall Saint, who had broken through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. Another student chimed in, saying that Luu was only 3 years old, and how was it possible for someone so young to be enrolled in Blue Star University? The group fell silent, and the old Professor Zuo Yuan smiled, saying, "You should know that Luu is indeed the same Luu we knew."

Some students were unable to comprehend the situation, thinking that it was too ridiculous for someone so young to be enrolled in the University, even if he was a genius. Others felt that it was normal, considering that Luu had broken through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. The circle of students in the Jinshin District was small, but they knew each other well, and quickly spread the news of Luu's enrollment.

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

As the son of a marshal, Luu had a special status. He had not only broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, but he had also mastered the posture of a martial Saint. What was truly remarkable, however, was his age - just over three years old. He had enrolled in the prestigious Blue Star Martial Arts University, setting a new record for the youngest student to be admitted. News of his extraordinary achievement spread like wildfire, causing a sensation throughout the university and beyond. Many voices of admiration and skepticism were heard, with some questioning how a mere Second Realm cultivator could enter such a revered institution. Others marveled at the idea, saying it was only natural for a Super Genius like Luu to take advantage of such opportunities.

Despite the commotion he had caused, Luu showed little care. In fact, his fame had grown exponentially since breaking through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower. His every move was scrutinized and discussed, making it seem like his fate was already sealed. Next, Zokiki took him on a tour of the God School District, introducing him to the secret boundaries of the trial and the Marshall Way Collection, which contained various secret arts, techniques, and mental disciplines. The Jun Shojo, a 10,000 Laws building and Master's family's 10,000 Swords Pavilion, also caught his attention - all these institutions were off-limits, but they were also possible for those with the proper credits.

Luu was surprised to learn that credits were necessary to access these esteemed institutions. "It's a super genius in the Godin District, and it comes with a price," he said wryly. Zuo Yuan smiled good-naturedly and began to explain the system of credits. "To earn credits, you can either break into the secret realm of Trials or complete tasks for the university. Each stage earns a certain amount, and you can also trade credits with other students."

Luu nodded, understanding that this was a motivational strategy. If everything were free, it would stifle growth and progress. Zuo Yuan led him to an ancient Tower, which was actually The Reincarnation Tower of the human race. Zuo Yuan proudly stated that there were four such towers, one for each School District, but they all led to the same destination: the secret realm of Trials. Although the layout of the secret realm and The Reincarnation Tower differed, the effect was the same - both served as a testing ground for cultivators to demonstrate their abilities.

Luu couldn't help but smack his lips in disagreement, laughing at the notion that The Reincarnation Tower was still a better place to hone one's skills. He wasn't exaggerating - there was no comparison. Zokiki chuckled and continued, explaining that The Reincarnation Tower served as a filter for Cosmic Geniuses, while the human Race's secret realm of Trials was created to nurture these exceptional cultivators. Though the methods and effects differed, the goal remained the same: to discover and cultivate potential.

As Zuo Yuan spoke, Luu's expression changed, and he began to question the second-old Professor's words. Was it really possible to break through higher realms without sufficient cultivation? Zuo Yuan's next words gave Luu pause - breaking into a fifth or sixth Realm reincarnation Tower with a Second Realm cultivator was essentially impossible. The second realm reincarnation Tower was significantly more challenging than the first Realm, and the fifth and sixth Realms were far, far more difficult - hundreds and thousands of times more so.

In the fifth realm, the disadvantage could not be overlooked, and the entrance to this trial, the Mystery Realm, was open to all five Realms. Zuo Yuan smiled as he said, "If we truly allow you to break through the first level, the pressure will fall upon the freshmen. These students, who have been enrolled for several months, have yet to pass the first level of the Mystery Realm. If you come up here and break through, what does that make them look like?" Although the words were clear, Zoo Yuan didn't believe that Luu could pass the first layer, as his realm was too low.

The second realm requires challenging a Dharma body martial artist, even the most gifted would find it difficult to do so. Luu smiled but remained silent, filled with weariness. "We'll have to try to find out if we can break through or not. Let's just go straight in and break in," he said.

Zoo Yuan nodded and gave Luu some noteworthy points. Luu listened attentively and then walked into the ancient Tower as the old Professor had said. There was a water screen in the center of the ancient Tower. Walk into the water screen, and you'll be in the middle of The Secret World of the Mystery Realm. This secret realm of Trials had no concept of death; even if you die in battle, you're simply eliminated out. However, unlike the Reincarnation Tower, it is part of the rules. It's more of a virtual world simulation but with near-perfect results. The Reincarnation Tower was truly too Heaven-defying, and it was already quite impressive for the human race to imitate a similar one.

Meanwhile, the Ginin District student group had seen Luu playing high and mighty and not speaking for so long. When Zoo Yuan saw this, he somewhat helplessly replied back to the group, "He went to break into the secret realm of Trials, so there's no time to chat." The group instantly boiled over at that comment. "What is this going to break into the secret realm of Trials? He's only in the second realm. How could he possibly break through?"

"Should just go and try it out. How's it going? I'm going to watch it live." "You have to pay credits to watch the live stream of the secret of Trials. Who's going to lend me a little bit of credits? I'll give him a million star dollars as interest, and I'll pay it back in a month."

As the news spread, the entire Blue Star University came alive. Many students, even if they paid a certain amount of credits, wanted to watch Luu's breakthrough. They all wanted to know if this Super Genius who had broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower would be able to break through the first floor of the secret realm of Trials.

As soon as he came up The Secret World of Trials, a great figure stood in the midst of the storm. The wind was howling, but he was like a statue, not moving. Just then, he slowly opened his eyes and looked at the person in front of him in surprise. "Second realm?" he thought he had been mistaken. Upon closer inspection, it wasn't a disguise at all; it was indeed only the second realm.

"How did the second realm come over, little fellow? How did you get in?" Luu answered truthfully, "I'm a student here to break in." When he heard this, he immediately laughed and said, "Interesting. It's been a long time since I've met such a young student. Allow me to introduce myself. I am the secret Lord of this trial secret realm. You may address me as Marshall ancestor."

Luu froze and couldn't help but ask, "The legendary Marshall ancestor, the one who pioneered the human Marshall da?" The Marshall ancestor nodded and smiled smugly, "That's right, that's right. It's this Grand Master." Luu opened his mouth and asked with some disbelief, "Then how are you still alive? This was a strong person from before the star Marshall calendar. The Starwood calendar alone is over two thousand years old. It was at least two thousand years before the Star Wars calendar. In other words, this Marshall ancestor had lived for at least 4,000 years."

The Marshall ancestor shook his head, "No, I died a long time ago. However, I am not completely dead. Not yet." What are you asking for? Are you here to break in or are you here to pick a fight?" Luu said in a hurry, "Good. The Marshall ancestor just waved his hand, and in midair, a large door slowly opened. He said with a smile, "This trial mystery realm has a total of nine floors. If you, kid, can break through the first floor with the second realm, I can give you a little benefit."

The Marshall ancestor obviously didn't know much about the many information in the outside world. He didn't even know that Luu had broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower. But what was certain was that this little guy was definitely not an Idol. Yes, Luu nodded his head in response. He could hear that even this Marshall ancestor didn't think that he could break through the first layer and even incentivized him.

Luu, eager to test the difficulty of the first level of this mysterious trial realm, did not hesitate. He wielded the Ji Shin Shing sword, stepped onto the white Jade Wind in Fire Wheel, and donned the Dragon Scale Battle Armor, fully armed. He then forcefully made his way into the first layer of the secret realm. As Luu vanished from sight, the Marshall ancestor remarked with surprise, "This young man possesses many fine treasures. However, the realm is too low to fully utilize their original power."

In the Secret World of Trials, the first level was an icy glacier. A Dharma body Powerhouse scoffed at Luu, "How dare you come to die in the second realm?" Luu, too lazy to engage in idle talk, raised his long sword and executed a lethal move, "Pull Sword Prison." At that moment, the power of this move was even greater than when it was used on the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. In an instant, the sword prison completely enveloped the Dharma body Powerhouse. Countless sword lights, like a meat grinder, madly carried out strangulation in a defenseless situation. The Dharma body Powerhouse instantly turned into a cloud of blood mist.

Luu felt a sense of ease, but suddenly sensed something was amiss. He looked up and saw a figure covered in scars in the godslayer sky above. The figure narrowed his eyes and stared at Luu, "Daring to come and break through the barrier at the second realm, there really is still something. Your move already has the meaning of a fledgling domain, but the force is not as good as it should be. The quality is adequate, but the quantity is way off. If you are not of the second realm but of the fourth or fifth realm, then I'm afraid I'm no match for you with your current strength. It's impossible to win against me."

These truths were naturally clear to Luu. At this stage, he was only at the second realm and had yet to forge a golden body. Even if he mastered the inscriptions and strung them together to gain an increase in battle power, forming a Dharma body was simply impossible. Only by forging a golden body could one form a Dharma body and complete the leap in energy. The reasoning was still the same. With the body of the second realm of the district breaking into this secret realm of Trials, Luu was at a significant disadvantage. The three Realms, the four Realms, the golden body, and the Dharma body technically speaking, Luu had crossed four levels to fight at the moment. It was hard to win against an opponent in such a situation.

Neither the old Professor nor the Marshall ancestor was optimistic that he would be able to break through the first layer. It was not a slight on him, rather it was really too difficult for a second realm martial artist to cross over and defeat a Dharma body Powerhouse. But how about this? Luu raised his head, his eyes full of battle intent. He was not the least bit afraid, even if the enemy was strong and the hope of victory was however slim. He didn't think he would lose. "Cut the crap, come fight," he challenged.

Beneath Luu's feet, the white Jade Wind and Fire rotated crazily as he leaped up and killed this Dharma body Powerhouse once again. Luu's actions attracted the attention of many students at Blue Star Universe University. One by one, students even at the cost of credits would watch the battle. "Here it comes, Jia sword Emperor's extreme sword prison. Pity it almost took the first level Guardian seconds. This move he has mastered it perfectly. Enough, but the realm is too low so he simply can't bring out the power that he was supposed to have. Yes, in the past when I was in the second realm reincarnation Tower, I was still able to be unbeatable. But the Guardians of this secret realm of Trials are actual Dharma body powerhouses. Obviously, the gap is so big. But he didn't have the slightest fear and killed again. This sword is so beautiful, extreme Lumen sword light. Right, it should be that sword. Wait, I can't believe he's getting stronger and stronger. He's got the upper hand. No, could he really break through?"

It was not just these students who were paying attention. Some teachers and professors, and even Fo Wang, the president of Blue Star University, were following the battle. Fo Wang hastily clicked on the live stream and watched. "I have to say this, Luu is very talented in battle. He knows how to utilize his advantages. It actually beat the first floor Guardians to pass a defense for a time. Nice, that's really good. Unfortunately, it's just that the gap in energy is too great. Even though every sword is a killing move, it still can't solve the opponent. The second realm Crossing combat Dharma body, it's still too much of a stretch. It's hurt so many times, but none of the swords are fatal wounds. Awesome, awesome. Such a disparity in Realms and still able to fight like this. No wonder you were able to break through to the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower. Unfortunately, the difference in Realms is absolute. If he has been unable to strike a fatal wound, it's only a matter of time before he loses. This Luu should have already realized this problem. But he still remains calm. This heart is really good."

The Secret World of Trials, the first layer, the gatekeeper was being pressed by Luu, and his face was full of humiliation at the moment. District 2 Realm, a mere second realm, in a rage.

The first layer of the Barrier Keeper's body inscriptions bloomed with brilliant light, and his Dharma body's complete State rapidly condensed. "You've provoked me, and I had no intention of bullying you," he said.

Luu's face became even grimmer when he saw this scene. The Dharma full body, although not as good as the Dharma phase on the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, was tough enough. The moment the Barrier Keeper's body instantly skyrocketed 10-fold in speed, strength, defense, and all-around attributes, completing a Leap Forward. The situation was reversed in an instant. The Keeper pressed in, and Luu, in a violet retreat, brandished the long sword in his hand and used his bottom card to kill the evil.

The battle just now had made him certain that this Guardian was an existence similar to a spirit body. So, this evil-cutting sword technique might have a strange effect. In this instant, the sword blossomed with dazzling sword light like a brilliant sun, a golden radiance spreading in all directions. It was like an invisible chain, quickly wrapping around the Barrier Keeper, binding his hands and feet.

The guardian's face changed dramatically. What the hell kind of move is this? His movements felt incredibly sluggish, as if they were locked in place by something. It was like encountering a natural enemy, and fear actually arose in his heart. This evil-cutting sword technique that he had just barely mastered had an unexpectedly good effect. He looked at the gatekeeper and, without hesitation, directly swung his sword to kill the evil. A brilliant sun was thrown out in this instant. The gatekeeper detected the aura of death. Unlike the previous defeats, he had a premonition that the consequence of being hit by the sword would be very serious.

The gatekeeper was in a hurry. The inscriptions on his body were quickly strung together, directly breaking free of the invisible chains and narrowly escaping the suppression of this brilliant sun. After escaping into the distance, the guardian gasped for air, as if he was scared half to death. His heart was constantly slandering, "Where did this pervert come from?" But the second realm! Why could he have so many powerful moves? Outrageous!

Without the slightest hesitation, the gatekeeper directly used a killing move. He was only seen flashing with inscriptions all over his body, which were then strung together once more in the next instant. One inscription actually detached from the Dharma body and quickly coalesced into a black lance. This move is called the Godslayer Lance. The Guardian stared at Luu, dead in the face. "If you can block this move, then it's my loss."

Luu couldn't help but be a bit surprised when he saw the scene of inscriptions strung together. Not only can you increase your strength, but you can also use inscriptions to attack. It was quite an eye-opener. Luu didn't think much and swung his sword again. In the meantime, the gatekeeper violently threw out the Lance in his hand. The black lance crossed in midair without the slightest resistance, just like a fish swimming in the water, smooth to the extreme.

In the next instant, it collided with Luu's sword light. Boom! The collision of a sword and a spear immediately erupted with terrifying might. The entire layer of space shook, and the glaciers around them rapidly collapsed. There was a huge explosion. The black lance was briefly blasted back but it automatically adjusted its angle and continued to attack Luu.

Luu dodged the Lance as a result, but it continued to track him. This time, it was too late to dodge again. Luu could only raise his sword to parry. This collision immediately made Luu feel a huge force, like a tiger pressing down on him. A sense of powerlessness instantly surged through his heart. Was this a pure energy gap?

Luu's body shook, and his consciousness rapidly blurred. Blue Star University's older students were showing incredible expressions, one by one, dead center on the live feed. Losing was normal. If he let a second realm barge through, he would be really groundless.

"How long has it been since the Guardians of the first level of the secret realm of Trials haven't used this move?" The old Professor Whato Yuan looked over and said consolingly, "It's normal to lose. After all, you're only in the second realm. However, it's already very impressive that you were able to force the guardian of the first level to use the Godslayer Lance."

On the first floor, the Godslayer Lance, a sword technique specialized in restraining spirits, caught Zacha Gaki's curiosity. L nodded, and Zuo Yuan laughed, commenting on the young man's ruthlessness. He rarely used this move, leaving Luu wondering if other first-level Guardians avoided it too.

Zuo Yuan confirmed that in recent years, this was the first time he used the Godslayer Lance in public. Many students begged him to showcase the move, but he refused. It's his strongest stance, and he didn't want to reveal it. Luu understood the significance, as he too used the Evilslayer Sword Technique without martial virtues, and the Gatekeeper used the Godslayer Lance without Marshall virtues. Despite the apparent loss, the Reeside Gun was still visible. Luu carefully studied the move, eager to learn from it.

Zuo Yuan noticed Luu's eagerness to retreat and suggested taking him to the Xin Shin Dojo. They discussed the low probability of breaking through the first level among this year's freshmen, only 0.2%. It was normal for Luu not to break through, and breaking in doesn't guarantee survival. Most freshmen were killed within seconds of entering, while a few managed to learn a few moves before being eliminated. Some could fight back and forth before being defeated, and those who almost won were even fewer. Luu was considered one of the latter, having forced out the DSi gun.

Luu was surprised to learn that so few students from the Jinshin School District broke through the first level. Out of the last 30 freshmen, only three passed. By sophomore stage, most students had broken through the first tier, and many had even broken through the second tier, starting to challenge the third tier. Currently, the highest number of layers among students in the town God School District broke through the seventh layer.

Luu was curious about the approximate strength of the seventh-floor guardian. Zuo Yuan replied that they had stepped into the Domain level fields, the realm above the Dharma Body in the Dharma phase. Luu realized he underestimated the heroes of the world at Blue Star University, which gathered the pride of the entire human community. This wasn't a small fight, especially during the first or second realm. Luu could still sweep and crush everything during those realms, but facing true Heavenly Prides at Blue Star University, his strength was inadequate.

Zuo Yuan explained that if someone in the secret realm of Trials pushed all the way across, it would be suspicious regarding how the human race dominated the universe. Even the topmost Blue Star University wasn't more than that. This wasn't very realistic, but it showed how impressive Lu's father's achievement was in breaking through the ninth floor and clearing the secret realm of Trials.

Luu recalled his father, Lu Chang, entering Blue Star University at the age of 10. Zuo Yuan confirmed this and added that Lu Chang broke through the ninth floor at 14 and graduated. Initially, he showed no impressive talent in the elite school district but rapidly improved after enrolling. He quickly rose to the Jinshin School District and eventually became the number one student.

As Luu listened to Zuo Yuan's narration, he couldn't help but picture his father's youthful and spirited appearance. They then arrived at the Xin Shin Dojo, where Zuo Yuan explained that cultivating there required credit consumption. As a new student, Luu had 100 credits, allowing him about 30 days of training. He needed to use his time wisely. Luu nodded and chose a futon to sit on, immediately feeling a sense of peace and an indescribable, intangible feeling.

Chapter 142: A Sword Breaks the Pass

A wave of excitement surged through Luu as the Tiue Diffractive Dharma Pill began to operate slowly in his mind. The image of the Gods-slaying gun resurfaced, as if a heavy fog was being lifted. Luu's eyes grew brighter and brighter as he saw it so clearly. It is so, it is... I got it.
Under the triple boost of the Jinin Dowfield, Tyu Immortal Cell, and Tiue Defract Dharma Pill, Luu penetrated the essence of that black lance. This momentary epiphany allowed Luu to find a whole new angle to look at those inscriptions. It dawned on him.
Everything is made easy under his control. Inscription after inscription was quickly strung together, like water to water accumulating Earth into mountains and water into an abyss. Countless battles in The Reincarnation Tower, many enlightenment Dharma stone tablets of Heaven and Earth, regicide gun - everything little by little accumulates and is summarized, infused.
Nosis, nosis, nosis. With constant enlightenment, it's only been 5 hours. The 128 inscriptions that Luu had mastered were actually completely linked together, an unprecedented sense of euphoria filling Luu's heart. Haha, he couldn't help but laugh out loud. There are times when failure doesn't mean it's bad. This failure allowed Luu to see his shortcomings and also the subtlety of the Dside gun.
After mastering the brand new method, it was so smooth to string together 128 inscriptions. No doubt about it. Luu's strength at this moment had once again taken a qualitative leap. I wonder if I can break through the first layer now, with this thought, Luu did not hesitate in the slightest and directly stood up and left the Gods' depressing Dojo. He decided to break into the secret realm of Trials again, but what Luu didn't expect was when he entered the secret realm of Trials, there was a surprising line.
Those who came here were freshmen from the town God School District, as well as sophomores and juniors from other school districts. When they saw Luu, they were first stunned, then they greeted each other. Obviously, because Luu had almost broken through the first layer, it gave them a lot of pressure. And one by one, they couldn't wait to come over and break through the trial mystery realm. You can't after all this time in school let a three-year-old overtake you. Can you? Many people secretly vowed in their hearts that they would absolutely rush ahead of Luu.
At this moment, they were not surprised to see Luu come over again. It's all too normal to feel unconvinced when you don't make it and want to do it again. They've done it before, but it had only been a few hours. There couldn't have been much change at all, and it was basically impossible to break through the first layer. However, it's not good to hit them in the face, and no one said anything. Luu had planned to queue up to go in the first level, which would allow nine people to break through at the same time. So he wouldn't need to queue for a long time before it was his turn.
As a result, the seniors were so enthusiastic that they made way for Luu to break in first under the hospitality, Luu could not afford to push back. When Luu entered the first layer, and the news is not going anywhere, of course, this one didn't raise a lot of eyebrows. Most of the students were unwilling to spend credits to watch Luu's breakthrough anymore because he had already failed once. Breaking in again in such a short period of time was simply not going to work. It's only been a few hours. Can strength still soar? Obviously, it's a doomed battle.
In the meantime, The Secret World of Trials, the first layer above the glacier, the first floor Guardian looked down at Luu, the little fellow of the second realm. "You're here again," he said with a smile. "I've gotten quite a bit of progress after the battle earlier. Please use the Gods-slaying Lance again."
"Ha," the gatekeeper laughed contemptuously. "You're only tougher with that sword. I'll be more careful this time, even if I don't use the Gods-slaying Lance. I'll be able to easily finish you off."
"Okay," Luu replied, hearing this, he stopped talking nonsense and directly swung his sword, the Puman Sword. Light under the string of 128 inscriptions, the power of this sword had more than doubled and tripled. Originally, it could only injure a layer of Gatekeepers, but at this moment, it even directly crushed through.
"Hauh, no, no," the first tier of Gatekeepers reacted for a split second, but it was obviously too late. If he had used the Gods-slaying gun from the start, he might not have been able to fight Luu. But alas, there are no ifs.
Under this sword, the guardian only resisted hard for a moment before turning into flying dust. In the last instant, his thoughts were, "How could that be? How long has it been, and why has it suddenly gotten so strong?" That's a win.
Luu was somewhat surprised by the power of his sword, but on second thought, it's normal. The Guardians of this first level were actually not particularly strong. The Dharma body, though fully formed, actually has only 54 inscriptions. The number of inscriptions Luu you had mastered was almost more than double that of his. It was just that before that, it hadn't been fully strung out, plus the gap in realms was also too big. So that's why the fight was so strenuous. However, if Luu's realm was slightly raised, not to mention to the fourth or fifth realm, even if he broke through to the Third Realm, he would have a chance to break through. At this moment, stringing together 128 inscriptions, his strength was qualitatively improved. So naturally, he would win.

Just then, a line of hints appeared in front of Luu's eyes: "You have broken through the first level of the trial Mysteries. Next, your choice is to continue to break through or to attend to the inscription Stone Tablet." Looking at the words in front of him, Luu did not hesitate and chose to continue to break through. From the old professor's side, he learned that as long as he broke through the first layer, he could refer to the inscription Stone Tablet at any time. The time for enlightenment was limited to 7 days. Even if he failed to break into the second level this time, the time would not be reduced. Therefore, there was no hurry to participate. Let's go first and see just how powerful the Guardians of the second level are in the secret realm of Trials.

The sculpture-like Marshall ancestor suddenly opened his eyes and looked up, saying with some surprise, "This is breaking through the crowd." In line, people froze at those words. In the secret realm of Trials, there were a total of nine Realms, each level allowing nine people to break through at once. Besides Luu, there were eight other people who had gone in to break through the barrier. Could it be that Chin Chong broke through? Fan Shang Yang Ru was also a possibility. It should be one of these three. The crowd murmured, and many people even asked the Marshall ancestor directly, "Grandpa Wuzu, who has broken through the first floor? Who is he? Can you tell us?" Feeling the curious gazes of the crowd, the Marshall ancestor's face was a bit subtle as he opened his mouth to answer, "It's Luu." The atmosphere, which was still somewhat lively, instantly became quiet. A pin dropped, and everyone's eyes widened, hardly believing their ears. Previously, when they heard the news, they had also thought that it might be Luu, but this answer was subconsciously ignored by them, or rather, deep down, they were unwilling to accept that Luu had easily surpassed them. Just as the hearts of the crowd were horrified and boiling, he heard the Marshall ancestor continue, "He used only one sword to kill the first level Guardian and is now breaking into the second floor. This is like a heavy bomb." Many geniuses had their mouths wide open, their jaws almost dropping to the ground. A few hours ago, when Luu broke through the first layer, he was still surrounded by a layer of Guardians, and he only killed them. Only a few hours had passed, and Luu was able to kill a layer of Gatekeepers with a single sword. Did he hide his strength before? No, obviously not. The only possibility was that he had grown again in just a few hours, his strength directly off the charts. As this news spread, it quickly caused an uproar.

Fourth shift, this chapter is a reward plus chapter 143 Jade Lotus Root Golden Pill. The news spread quickly like wildfire. However, in the blink of an eye, the entire Blue Star University knew the news. Luu, the son of the Marshall Saint, had just arrived at the school on his first day and had broken through the first level of the secret realm of trials. That news alone was enough of a surprise. Then, you're telling me that with just a single stroke of his sword, he decimated the Guardian and directly crushed him. This is too fake. Many people watched the live stream hours earlier. At that time, Luu had used all of his killing moves and used all of his strength but had not been able to break through the first layer. In fact, it was normal that he didn't break through, as he was only in the second realm. Even if his talent was high, it couldn't make up for the gap in the realm. But now, only a few hours had passed, and he had broken through the first layer in a crushing manner. How is that possible? When the crowd heard the news, their first reaction was disbelief because this news completely defies their perception. I'll be damned if I'm going to believe it. Soon, someone had gone to check the records of the trial mystery Realms breakthroughs, and it was clear to see that Luu had already broken through the first layer and was currently killing on the second layer. No such fake news, but it's actually true. No doubt about it. The entire Blue Star University quickly boiled over. Group chats in various school districts were buzzing. What's going on? What the hell? It's only been about 5 hours. How did this Luu suddenly become so strong? I don't understand. I can't understand at all. This growth rate is too fast. I figured it out. I know what's going on. What's going on? Come on, tell me. Don't keep me in suspense. You guys should remember when he broke into the Reincarnation Tower before. That was when he was like this. The growth rate was extraordinary, almost every once in a while, there were leaps and bounds of improvement. When he broke into the first realm Reincarnation Tower, he had only mastered a dozen or so inscriptions, but it turned out that in the blink of an eye, he had mastered dozens, hundreds. The growth is too fast. Right when he first broke into the one realm Reincarnation Tower, he only made it to the end of the seventh floor and failed to break through at that time. The first place winner of the one realm Reincarnation Tower was a genius from the sea.

God Clan, he was the only one who reached the eighth floor. That's right, that Genius of the Sea God Clan even declared war on Luu three times, but in the end, when they truly fought, they were directly crushed because that month, Luu grew again. Yes, when he started to break into the second realm of the Reincarnation Tower, Luu's strength was still growing. Eventually, he managed to break through to the ninth floor. In fact, if you think about it carefully, his growth rate is horrifying. Just watch the live broadcast; there's no sense of reality, and now personally experiencing his growth rate only makes you feel incomparable horror.

"Asterisk asterisk asterisk asterisk Sounds reasonable to me when I hear you say it. Outrageous! I think it's reasonable too."

Whom Fong Guang, the president of Blue Star University, was also stunned when he heard this news. Even he found it unbelievable. Fong Wang hurriedly called up the breakthrough video to take a look, and it really was just like the rumors – just one sword, and he passed the first level. This is actually real! Looking at the image in front of him, Fong Wang was amazed. This kind of natural talent is truly outrageous. It's only been 5 hours, and he's gotten so much stronger. It's simply like being open. Fong Wang hurriedly watched Luu's breakthrough live on the second level. The difficulty is much higher than the first. The Dharma body powerhouses at the second level had a full 101 inscriptions on their bodies. At the moment he was fighting Luu, it was only after more than 100 rounds that he was able to suppress Luu by virtue of his realm advantage. Seeing this scene, Fang's eyelids suddenly jumped. "This guy, he won't go cultivate for a few more hours and then break through the second layer, right? At this rate of growth, next year he could even participate in the 10,000 Races Heaven's Pride battle and fight for the human race for a wisp of civilization's flame. No, no, I think too much. It shouldn't be defeated."

Luu shook his head, his expression filled with regret as he shook his head. "Inside, I thought that I could rush through the second layer in one breath. The result is still a little short. If only I had raised my realm slightly upwards. Raising to the Third Realm should be enough to break through. It's still too much of a disadvantage to break through with the second realm. Next, in addition to inscription mastery, I'll have to try to raise my realm as much as possible. But first, let's go to the first level of the inscription stone tablet."

Just as Luu was thinking this, he suddenly saw the quest prompt appear. "Stage one Mission: Obtaining the approval of 100 students has been completed. Mission reward: Jade Lotus Root Golden Elixir has been issued. That's the job done."

Luu was a bit surprised. He knew that this task wasn't difficult, but he still didn't expect that it would be done so quickly. Just by passing the first level, he was recognized by 100 of his classmates. He had thought that he would have to break through to at least the second or even the third level. Luu didn't think much about it and hastily glanced at the item description: "Jade Lotus Root Golden Pill. Rank: Eighth quality. Excellent. Type: Consumable. Effects: After taking it, it can increase your life expectancy by an additional 100 years and further raise the upper limit of your foundation as well as drastically increase the strength of your physical body. Description: A superior golden elixir that can be taken by even ordinary people. Just that it will take an extremely long time to fully digest it."

Luu's eyes lit up. "I have to say, the difficulty of the quest is low, but the rewards are not subtle at all. Real good stuff. Whether it was to increase the lifespan, enhance the foundation, or increase the strength of the physical body, it was an incomparable effect. The bottom line is that this stuff works for ordinary people. Prior to this, Luu's foundation, after being transformed by the Da Embo Dan as well as the Dragon Tiger Golden Dan, was already top-notch enough. But compared to those in the universe which were extremely special and rare, strange beings, they were still slightly inferior. After breaking through the Reincarnation Tower once, it allowed Luu to raise his horizons quite a bit, knowing very well where the flaws and strengths of the human race lay. If one could gradually grow into a hexagonal warrior with these golden elixirs, one would certainly be invincible in the future."

"The Great Hall of Inscribed Stones. Stone monument after stone monument erected left and right. The monolith is inscribed with inscriptions. This was the heartfelt work of a Marshall Emperor. In the lower right corner of the stone tablet, it was written the time when the stone tablet was carved as well as the names of those Marshall Emperors. Luu just swept a glance and found the names Lu Chang Chang as well as Joe Wuan on the stone tablet. There are 31 stone tablets in all from the hand of Pops. There are also 18 stone tablets from the Master's Hand. Luu almost immersed himself in it after just a brief visit and couldn't help but want to have an epiphany. Nice place, sure is a great place. No wonder the old professor said for martial artists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh realms, this secret realm of Trials is even more effective than the Reincarnation Tower. This is not true."

"Chapter 144. 4 years old, finally no longer 3 years old, but why does only have seven days to enroll? On second thought, Luu vaguely understood the reason. Reason: If one is overly influenced by another person's towel, then it's hard..."

To get out of your own way, even in severe cases, the foundation can be shaken. After all, even if you follow the path of your predecessors, you can't be completely immersed in it without having a little something of your own. Whether it was The Reincarnation Tower or the secret realm of Trials, there was a time limit to comprehending these stone tablets, for this reason. Lloyd no longer felt sorry for himself and sat down on his knees, beginning to observe these inscribed stone tablets. At the same time, the Tiue immortal cell's diffractive Daradan began to slowly operate under the influence of these two Treasures. The originally obscure and difficult to understand inscriptions on this piece of stone tablet gradually became simple and clear. Lloyd could clearly sense that there were quite a few differences between the inscription stone tablet carved by human powerhouses and the inscription stone tablet of The Reincarnation Tower. What's the difference? To make a simple analogy, the inscribed stone tablets of The Reincarnation Tower were like textbooks, providing systematic foundational knowledge and skills as the core material for teaching and learning. On the other hand, the human inscribed tablets were like tutorials, used to consolidate and expand on textbook points, providing more in-depth explanations. Despite their differences, the general direction was the same; they seemed to validate each other for enlightenment. The thought flickered in Lloyd's mind, leaving him feeling a little heartbroken. He tried it - Lloyd closed his eyes and attempted to recall the Dow Rhythm of the inscribed stone tablet of The Reincarnation Tower. Then, he opened his eyes again and tried to refer to the inscribed stone tablet in front of him. A few hours later, his eyes shone bright, and he exclaimed that it worked wonders. However, he realized that this was a very difficult method, even for someone whose enlightenment was heaven-defying, like himself. He was the only one who barely succeeded, thanks to the added power of the Tiue immortal cells and the Tiue defraction pill. The effect of this kind of enlightenment was indeed too good; in just a few hours, Lloyd had mastered four inscriptions, making it feel as easy as eating and drinking. While the feeling was exhilarating, he pressed down his excitement and continued to begin his enlightenment. It was seven days in the blink of an eye; on that day, in the god-suppressing dojo, he hadEnumerated 128 inscriptions in just five hours, allowing his strength to skyrocket. It was the accumulation of months; after that, it was just a matter of reaccumulation. As a result, his cultivation speed was not even the slightest bit slow. In seven days, he had enumerated a total of 52 inscriptions. Now, the number of inscriptions he had mastered was 180, a number that was scary. The vast majority of Dharma body powerhouses didn't master that many inscriptions. The ultimate in theoretical Dharma was 199 inscriptions, but Lloyd vaguely felt that it was someone else's ceiling, not his own ceiling. The reason was simple: generally speaking, after mastering 100 inscriptions, the further one went, the more difficult it became. But Lloyd didn't even feel that there was a so-called bottleneck present. When he slowly opened his eyes, they were full of intent. But in seven days, his strength had once again changed qualitatively; it should be possible to break through the second level of the trial mystery realm. But Lloyd was in no hurry to break in; he thought that progress was moving too fast, and he needed to sink his teeth into it. The path of martial arts, after all, needed to be taken one step at a time. In addition to enlightenment, he also needed realm advancement. Stopping at the second realm all the time was just too embarrassing. He needed to find a way to finish quenching his sinus before expressing anything, as time was like running water, slipping by unnoticed at his fingertips. These days, Lloyd could be described as extraordinarily fulfilling - he was cultivating, enlightening, and learning about soldiers, and occasionally he also had to discuss war matters with XIA. The commander-in-chief of the taiway Starfield war zone, Lloyd was not a class act, but his remarks, with their borrowed comments from his master's critique, were something that XIA seemed to know about. He looked at Lloyd with an air of knowing, as if he had planned to throw out quite a few questions to ask him. Lloyd said, "I need a little time to think about it." XIA replied, "There's no rush; take your time to think about it and give me an answer when you have the results." Then XIA let the issue spread to the Master's side. The Master glanced at Lloyd with a knowing look, which meant that both the Master and XIA were aware of each other's existence, but had a tacit understanding that neither side wanted to poke through. They continued to use Lloyd as a messenger because he was still trying to complete his main quest to recover the planet, which was no doubt about it. It's a win-win-win situation. Under Lloyd's persistent messaging, the situation at the front line had really improved in the blink of an eye. It's time for the end of the year; a living planet was successfully recovered, which is the first time in recent years

The human community has blown a massive counterattack, performing exceptionally well as a New Year's gift for the entire human race. In that moment, Lu felt a surge of emotions and a sense of accomplishment, despite the fact that the success had little to do with him. As a messenger, receiving this news was a testament to the gravity of his role. If he hadn't played the messenger, Jajuan wouldn't have been able to receive Lu's questions without reservation or offer him guidance. He was even grateful for this message, as it validated his contributions.

Luu glanced at the system prompt, noting that the news of the planet's recapture had been coming in for a while now, but this system hadn't moved much. He wondered if his relatively small involvement in the mission could be considered as contributing to the progress - after all, it's hard to ignore the value of any assistance. Louu frowned as a few more days passed by in what felt like a blink of an eye. A new year had begun, with Luu now 4 years old. He had grown up another year older, finally leaving behind his pre-teen years. Just like Luu, the system prompt for the quest appeared before him, inviting Lu to look at the details.

It wasn't long before Louu looked at the mission details, where news of the live planet's recapture rewarded him with not one, but a Jade bone pill. This discovery stunned Luu, who thought it didn't count at all, given his minimal role in the mission. Yet, in just a few days, the system had revised its stance, considering Lu's participation valuable and contributing to the mission's completion.

The situation had been completely stabilized on the recovered planet, and with the mission accomplishment, Lu's stress began to ease. Even though the specifics of the mission were shrouded in uncertainty, he felt hopeful that the quest had been successfully completed. The Jade bone pill he had received was for him, to mark the accomplishment.

Upon examining the Jade bone pill, Lu's eyes lit up at the name - Good stuff, indeed! The effects of this Jade bone pill were truly exceptional - it could change the roots and bones of ordinary beings, transforming them into the highest grade of Jade bones. Lu felt a mix of relief and excitement, as the pill's effects were just as described.

In Luu's mind, he couldn't help but think that, if he had discovered this Jade bone pill earlier, he would have easily undergone the tedious process of bone forging. On countless occasions, he had endured the slow, arduous process of polishing steel bones and vdra Bones, only to have the system set milestones at a slow pace. Even highly skilled individuals required an abundance of time to break through to the Jade bone stage. Yet, with his body transformed long ago and his roots fully developed, Luu's progress had been accelerated by the system. Still, even so, there remained an enormous distance to travel before he achieved the ultimate goal of attaining the Jade bone.

Luu thought it would be simple to overcome the remaining roadblocks with the Jade bone pill's help. No longer would he have to spend years perfecting his skills to achieve even the vdra Bone stage. He realized he could now accelerate his progress toward the Jade bone stage, provided he had consumed the pill at the right moment.

A blissful new year had begun, filled with promises of excitement and adventure. Luu spent the New Year's Eve enjoying delicious food and chatting with his mother - Yuyang. When his mom asked if he would be a four-year-old anymore, Lu replied innocently, stating that, as he had stopped being three years old (and being fooled around), that usually meant he had really grown up. His mother, Yuyang, chuckled, sensing her son's hidden mirth.

However, as the night went on, Luu mused, his thoughts turned to the risks of becoming the System's favorite, as he had been. Yuyang had also offered him the following commentary.

It has been a considerable time since your reckless behavior, and it has been just as long since I last physically confronted you, a month ago. You, Lou, murmured, "Why did you get hit by me?" Yu Yao glanced at you, and explained, "I put an end to the violence and upheld justice, which resulted in you actually beating me up." You, Lu, were filled with resentment, despite the passage of time since the incident.

Yu Yao, speechless, said, "Those young brats from the Marshall family are accustomed to being arrogant and domineering, bullying others based on their power. It's not even if you stepped in and slightly punished them, but as a result, you beat them nearly to death. Their psychological scars were so deep that they didn't dare leave their house for several months afterward. If someone hadn't intervened, they would have all been killed by you."

Bayu Ya was afraid that you would kill these people next time. She wondered, "How old is he that he starts the killing? What will it be like this time?" She decided to confront you and told you, "Blossom again, Luu."

When you heard this, you thought for a moment and said, "It's true that I've been a bit heavy-handed, but it's they who are at fault first. If I don't hit them harder, they won't even know where they're wrong. Where did they go wrong?"

Yu Yao asked after more than a month of discussing this matter again, and she calmed down quite a bit and could reason with you properly. "Martial artists exist to protect the weak, not to bully the weak," she said.

You said seriously, and Bayu Da froze when she heard this and subconsciously glanced at Lu Chang Shang, who hadn't said anything. Lu Chang Shang smiled and nodded. Bayu Yuyo said indifferently, "If you can always remember the words you say, I won't beat you up again."

Your eyes lit up. Many parents belittle their children, believing that children will always be children, even if they believe the words of outsiders. They are not willing to believe what their own children say, even if the child is a child prodigy. He still does not take his words seriously. There are not a few cases like this, so it's still hard to earn your parents' respect and even harder to build up your authority.

As Luu continued to reveal himself and became stronger and stronger, he gradually gained this proper attention. The originally cold and clear Marshall Saint residence became lively once again. Inside the Yagang Pavilion, the group of heroes once again gathered. Luu sat in the upper seat, enjoying the bragging rights of the Dasha group. Unfortunately, the little guys, the ass-kissing was a little off. Didn't a single person see that the recovery of the human planet had something to do with them? Whether it was Yanching or Chuang, surprisingly, neither of them had noticed that.

That's not enough Enlightenment. Luu shook his head and slowly opened his mouth. "You may not know that I have a part to play in recovering the fallen planets of the human race. This time, it was me who prompted all of this to happen."

The group of kid brothers froze for a moment, each of them staring incredulously. They all know big brother is awesome, it's the genius of geniuses, but this is too much, such a Frontline war effort. It is the result of countless generals and soldiers taking their lives to fight out. How dare big brother say that it was he who prompted all this?

For a while within Yagang Pavilion, it actually gradually became quiet. Even the Marshall Emperor who was watching the show outside froze for a moment and couldn't help but shake his head as he chuckled. "This L youu he's still just as fond of boasting as he was a year ago." A Marshall King on the side nodded, "That's right, even this credit has to be taken on him a bit too much. Kids, it's harmless to casually brag about it."

There were also people who shook their heads in disbelief, not feeling that this was anything at all. Obviously, these Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors who were watching the show didn't even think that this matter really had anything to do with Luu because it's ridiculous. Inside the Yagang Pavilion, Yuguan Ching was surprised but he hurriedly praised, "I knew that this matter must have something to do with big brother. I remember a long time ago big brother asked us how to recover those fallen planets. Right?"

Xuong nodded, "This matter it might really be related to big brother, but unlike before this time there weren't many responders for a moment the atmosphere was actually slightly awkward. Just then Ja Meo Yuen who was sitting in the corner suddenly stood up. My father also told me that recovering those fallen planets, Big Brother deserves a lot of credit."

The moment these words came out within the Yawang Pavilion, it was instantly quiet. Everyone subconsciously looked at J me Yuan. "Really," they all thought. This group...

The crowd, including the Marshals, Emperors, and Kings, were bewildered, unable to look away. Could this young boy truly be the son of Xiu? The thought seemed preposterous.

In Chapter 146 of "10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride Battle," XY Yuan felt the weight of their gazes. He was nervous, but not vain, for he knew the truth. His father had mentioned it several times during their video calls. Swallowing a mouthful of saliva, XY Yuan continued, "Everyone may be surprised, but this is indeed true. My father personally told me that without Luu, it would have been difficult to recover the Fallen planets of the human race. His existence is of utmost importance."

After a pause, XY Yuan added, "My father also said that he'll be back in a few days to receive his medal and has brought back a special gift for Big Brother." The entire Yaguang Pavilion erupted in excitement. Even Yaning looked at Luu in disbelief, his doubts fading away.

Outside, the several Marshals and Emperors exchanged glances, their disbelief evident. "It's actually true," one of them said, "This I'll ask Brother Xi. He just happens to be here." Upon hearing this news, they all went numb.

Inside the Yaguang Pavilion, Luu was in a good mood. His progress had been impressive. He had mastered 266 inscriptions, with 199 of them being tandem. His realm had broken through to the Third Realm, and his body was gradually metamorphosing into Steel bones under the effect of the Jade bonan. His command of military affairs had also improved, and his relationship with Xi was getting better.

Just then, someone asked if Luu would participate in the upcoming 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride Battle. The pavilion buzzed with excitement. Luu raised an eyebrow. He had heard of this battle, and a special mission prompt appeared in front of him. The mission was to qualify for the battle, kill the finalists, make a name for himself, and ascend to the first place. The rewards were enticing: five impregnated Elixirs, nine Leaf Elixirs, Lunar syrup, and the Purple Gold Pill.

Luu couldn't help but feel excited. He felt himself touching on the truth that the human community had gone downhill, and his father was tired. He secretly swore to change all that with his own hands. The tragedy of 40 years ago would not be repeated.

Yuan was one of the reasons the 10,00

aha Lu changed touched luu's head, then confirmed that he wasn't lying. There were truly 266 inscriptions. However, he wondered how long it had been since luu had mastered them. Although the reincarnation Tower's performance was significant, Lu changing found it astonishing that luu had reached such a level as a martial arts Saint. But the question was, how long had this been going on? Just half a year had passed, and the number of inscriptions had doubled.

Lu changing explained that the more one progressed in understanding something like inscriptions, the more difficult it became. Luu had mastered 199 inscriptions, and that was already the limit for most Celestial Pride members. It seemed as if luu faced no bottlenecks at all, and with only half a year's effort, he had mastered 266 inscriptions. Lu changing couldn't help but express his emotions, feeling responsible as a father for not realizing luu's progress was so fast.

Lu changing couldn't help but comment on luu's usual busy schedule, making it understandable for him to be unaware of such details. Luu wouldn't act like an ordinary child complaining about an irresponsible father. This statement could only come from Lu Chong Xong, but if he said it, it wouldn't work. Lu Chang Chang was not only luu's father but also the Marshall Saint of the entire human race.

Upon hearing this, Lu Chang Chang nodded with some relief and then mentioned the possibility of luu participating in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. However, there was a condition: luu had to break through the seventh level of the Blue Star University's trial Mystic realm. Only then would everyone be convinced of his abilities.

When luu heard this, he was stunned. It had been a while since he last explored the secret realm of Trials, but the difficulty of the secret realm was extraordinary. At the seventh level, the field was incredibly challenging. Lu Chang Shing subconsciously asked luu if he thought it was hard, and luu nodded, agreeing that it seemed difficult.

Lu Chang Xang smiled faintly, acknowledging that even with 266 inscriptions, luu still couldn't break through the seventh floor. However, he had heard of someone at Blue Star University who had managed to break through the seventh floor. This seventh layer, though, was just an ordinary level in the context of the 10,000 races' Heavens Pride battle. If luu couldn't reach this level, attending the battle wouldn't be worth it.

This was indeed the truth, as the old Professor had mentioned that among the current students of Blue Star University, the highest record for breaking through the barrier was the seventh floor. However, the system panel recorded that 40 years ago, during the 10,000 races' Heavens Pride battle, the human race's Heavens Pride was defeated, and not even a strand of their civilization's flame was contested. If luu couldn't break through the seventh floor, it would be better not to attend and disgrace himself.

Luu furrowed his brows, his expression becoming grave. Lu Chang Chang looked at luu's serious face and smiled, encouraging him since he wanted to attend the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle to make a break for it. Lu Chang Chang offered luu something that would lessen the realm gap.

Lu Chang Chang casually took out a small golden bead and explained that it allowed luu to use energy at the level of the golden body realm. Although it wasn't as good as the Dharma body realm, the gap wasn't as significant. Luu's eyes lit up, curious about this helpful item. Lu Chang Chang revealed that he had specially refined it a long time ago.

Originally, Lu Chang Chang's idea was to create a large number of golden body martial artists. However, martial artists of a low realm couldn't grasp this ring energy without causing some damage to themselves, so he had to give up on that plan. He never thought this item would be used by luu after all this time, considering that he had already mastered 266 inscriptions and should have no problem controlling this energy.

Luu nodded and took the golden body bead from Lu Chang Xang. He followed the methods and steps taught by his father, leaving his spiritual imprint on the bead and gradually receiving the energy of the golden body bead. It felt like an external energy source had been turned on, and a wave of furious energy surged into luu's body. This energy was like a rushing river compared to luu's previous Chi and blood power, which was a mere trickling stream.

The berserk energy recklessly flushed luu's tendons and limbs. This was the energy of the golden body realm. Luu couldn't help but sigh, realizing why it was so tough when they tried to break into the secret realm of Trials before. He hadn't realized the energy gap was so significant. The energy was overwhelming, almost on the verge of going berserk, but at that very moment, the inscriptions luu had mastered quickly surfaced, preventing the energy from spiraling out of control.

This one inscription was like a sea pearl, allowing the raging energy to gradually become calm and controllable. It worked, and Luu felt this huge energy and was slightly uncomfortable, but it's a bit uncomfortable, it's good to get used to it for a while. Lu Chang Shang said without thinking, "Good." Luu nodded and then put his question and asked, "Dad, back when you were at Blue Star University, you broke through the ninth layer of the secret realm of Trials. How did you do that with the posture of the fifth realm?"
He passed through the nine layers of the secret realm of Trials, defeating those guardians who controlled the realm. This war record, it's really not a general exaggeration. You know all this."
When Chang Shang heard this, he smiled and said, "Actually, it's hard to say. It's hard, but it's not hard to say. It's hard."
The five realms of cultivation, though only the golden body and Dharma body, but you have to know that this thing called inscription is the root of Dharma bodies, Dharma phases, and even domains. This means that you will be able to cast a Dharma phase and unfold a domain even when you are in the fifth realm, not being limited by the realm.
For example, the current you, who is clearly only in the Third Realm, has mastered 266 inscriptions. Although you are unable to form a Dharma body, the many inscriptions still bring you a powerful increase in your battle power, allowing you to challenge the fifth realm over the levels. Even those ordinary fifth realms are not even a match for you. Without a golden body, the Dharma body cannot be condensed. But you can take the step of the Dharma body and directly condense the Dharma phase and control the domain.
When Luu heard these words, he subconsciously said, "This is okay. Why not?"
Lu Chang Shang smiled, "You mastered inscriptions when you were in the second realm. Now that you're in the Third Realm and have mastered 266 inscriptions, you don't dare to continue onward instead? And what sense does that make? I see."
Luu nodded with an educated look, as if he understood.
"It's good that you understand," Lu Chang Shang smiled. "Come with me to the house of 10,00 laws, and I'll give you a lecture on the nature of Dharma phases and domains. After knowing your idea of planning to participate in the 10,00 Clans Heavenly Pride battle, I naturally have to support it. The golden body beads just make up the volume gap, but there is a gap in the qualitative aspect as well. Naturally, I have to be properly puzzled."
Luu was slightly stunned when he heard this. All along, Pops had always adopted a freer range attitude towards his cultivation. He rarely instructed Luu. This moment is a first. This made Luu inexplicably a little excited. He followed Pops on a short while and arrived at the manifestation building. Pushing open the heavy door, he walked into the 10,00 laws building. And only when his footsteps fell there was a fluctuation in the surrounding space, just like last time. Luu arrived in a marvelous space. The sky consisted of countless densely written words. There were tens of thousands of martial arts books floating around in different forms.
Lu Chang Shang looked around and said with a smile, "This 110,00 laws building, I built it casually in my early years. In addition to the use of Enlightenment, there is also the use of teaching. In the past, you were still young and did not know what the tower was. When I saw that you were gifted in the dao of the sword, I allowed you to be under Brother. When I saw that you progressed so fast and grew to this point in a short period of time, today, I will teach you the Dao and give you a clear explanation of the nature of the Dharma phases and domains. So be still and listen to me as I unfold the story. How much you can comprehend and how much you can Master is up to you."
Luu nodded with a solemn expression. The Marshall Saints' teach an ordinary person at the top of the day could let the Marshal Emperor give him a few pointers. However, Lu youu, due to his special status, was able to get the Marshall Saints' old man to teach himself the way. This is a very rare opportunity.
Lu youu quickly threw the distractions out of his mind. At the same time, the Tie Immortal Cells and Tie Defra of Dadan in his body began to slowly operate. Lu Chang Shang saw that Luu was ready and without any nonsense, he directly began to speak.
"As we all know, the essence of Dharma bodies, Dharma phases, and domains are all inscriptions. The question then arises, what is the nature of an inscription? Again, I can tell you quite bluntly that the essence of inscriptions is the power of Heaven and Earth. It is part of the rules, a materialization of the laws. One of the Essences of this universe comprehend inscriptions, Master inscriptions, string inscriptions, fuse inscriptions, and dismantle inscriptions. This is the manifestation of going from shallow to deep, controlling the power of the laws step by step. In figurative terms, that is Dharma body, Dharma phase, domain. If one law is universal, then all laws are universal. You are right now still on top of stringing together inscriptions. Next, you need to fuse inscriptions and then try to disassemble them."
Luu listened attentively to Lu Chang Shang's words, and for a while, he was mesmerized. The confusions of a long time ago were answered one by one. At this moment, a feeling of enlightenment arose. When his old man's teaching was over, he couldn't wait to begin his enlightenment.
When Lu Chang Shang saw this, a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

At first, he didn't feel that Luu could participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. However, as time passed, he changed his mind. Luu had brought him too many surprises, such as breaking through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower and obtaining two supreme treasures, which proved that he had the stature of a martial Saint. Why not this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle? If he could break into the top rankings and fight for a flame of civilization for the human race, it would be a great achievement for the entire human race. Lu Chang Xiang also knew that if the Heavens Pride battle were held ten years later, with Luu's qualifications, he would certainly sweep away all the Heaven's pride and ascend to the top with an incomparably strong stance. However, he was too small, his realm was too low, and his cultivation time was too short. With less than half a year until the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle opened, he really didn't have many opportunities. But this Epiphany lasted for a full month. Luu slowly opened his eyes, and an extremely complex Fusion inscription flashed in his eyes. Chapter 149: Speed Through the Secret Realm of Trials as if Struck by Lightning, Rewarded Plus More. During this month of Epiphany, Luu's progress was very exaggerated. The number of inscriptions reached 301, tandem inscriptions were even higher at 248, and one Fusion inscription was successfully fused. Although it was only the beginning of a phantom, the power was extraordinary. Unfortunately, dismantling the inscription was not yet a clue, and controlling the field was even further away. But that's normal; you have to eat your food one bite at a time and take the road one step at a time. It was not possible to have a single Epiphany and directly cast a Dharma phase in control of a domain. This was tantamount to a full stream. Even if there were a Marshall Saint ordination, if it really worked that well, Lu Chang Xiang would have collected a group of disciples long ago. Actually, the reason Luu had progressed so much was mainly due to his own Enlightenment being sufficient, coupled with the Tiue Diffractive Dharma pill and Tiue Immortal cells. Adding to it, out of the manifestation, Luu opened his communication device. Many people had contacted him during the time he was closed. It was still before the retreat, and a lot of people wanted to ask him out. As a result, Luu directly played disappearance and did not reply to any of them. Luu didn't think much about it and replied in unison, roughly explaining the situation. He needed to cultivate hard to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle and didn't have time to play around. The words came out, and the great summer Heroes chat group directly boiled over. No one had expected that Luu would actually want to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. One must know that for this Heavens Pride battle, almost all participants were Peak Dharma body existences. Luu was only a Third Realm, and even though he had mastered many inscriptions, the disadvantage was still too great. It's hard as hell to pull off another miracle. Sure, since big brother was participating, they did not say anything demoralizing and spoke out in encouragement. Le swept a glance and also saw that this group of little guys didn't think highly of himself, but that's normal. Not to mention them, even Master Xia Wuan didn't think that he could get a top ranking. A huge gap in strength is not something that can be salvaged by paying lip service. Even Luu himself could only take one step at a time. There were still a few months to prepare, and he could continue to get stronger. Got to get a grip. After the exit, Luu intended to return to Blue Star University to further his education before leaving the house. Mom handed Ji Gia's gift to herself. Luu froze; he had almost forgotten about it. Picking up the dagger, he examined it carefully. It was an extremely delicate dagger, with the hilt set with a dark blue gemstone. Drawing his dagger, the blade shone coldly, making one's scalp involuntarily go a little numb. With just a casual wave of his hand, space seemed to be sliced open, so sharp. Lu you marveled, this dagger is quite something; at the very least, it's a Heaven treasure. Jai's outburst was really generous. Luu thought about it and wrote an email stating that he had received this gift and thanked him very much for his kindness. Blue Star University Principal Fong Wang couldn't help but sigh as he looked at the trial secret realms breakthrough record. There's still only one who has broken through the seventh floor so far. Those who have broken through the sixth floor have increased by two, instead becoming five. If you put it in previous years, this would have been great, but with the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle this year, time is running out. Can only this good ceiling fight for the flame of civilization for the human race? I don't know what's going on with a couple of other colleges; I always feel like my hopes are a little slim this year. Originally, I was expecting that Luu would continue to surge forward and create more miracles. Now it seems that it's basically impossible. The record didn't move directly after he broke the first layer. Before, was this a case of silence, or is he planning to make a splash? Can't figure this little guy.

Out Fong Wang felt a bit sick and desperate. He wanted to pin his hopes on a little guy, but the little guy was too small. Even if he progressed rapidly, it was impossible for him to represent the human race in the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle. During this recent period, the freshmen who were at the same level as Luu had already broken through the first layer one after another, and many of them had also broken through the second layer, trying to break through the third. On the other hand, Luu, who was the center of attention, was completely silent. No one knew what he was doing. Just when Fong Wang was worried about the candidates for the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle, a message came through: Luu had returned to Blue Star University and directly went to break into the Secret Realm of the trial. Upon hearing this news, Fong Wang raised his eyebrows. The little guy finally couldn't help himself and planned to make a splash. I wonder how much progress he's made after all this time? Fong Guang hastily glanced at the live stream. The Secret World of Trials, second layer. The gatekeeper stood on top of the dune, looking down at Luu. "Little fellow, it's only been a while since I've seen you, and you seem to have gotten much stronger," the gatekeeper could clearly feel that this little fellow in front of him was different from the last time. "Make a move," Luu looked at the gatekeeper with a calm gaze and spoke blandly. "Arrogant," the gatekeeper snorted coldly. His Dharma body instantly coalesced, and his speed, strength, defense, and all aspects of his attributes skyrocketed. Although Luu was arrogant, the gatekeeper understood that this little guy surely had the strength to be arrogant. That being the case, there was absolutely no room for carelessness. "Come, battle!" The light in Luu's eyes flickered, and that battle intent was unprecedentedly high. As soon as he came up, the guardian used his own stance, however, before he could unleash it, a sword light attacked him. In the way of sword and martial arts, the most important thing was the speed of the sword. So fast, the gatekeeper was shocked and hastily crossed his arms to resist, but as a result, in a split second, he was completely annihilated and turned into flying ash. Next Level. Luu was not surprised by this situation and continued to break through the third level. "What a fast sword!" Fong Wang couldn't help but marvel. "And with this sword, it doesn't seem to be going all out. Sure enough, he's gotten a lot stronger." Soon after, Luu arrived at the third level, and still with just one sword, he killed the guardian. Seeing this scene, Fong Wang blinked. "This kid is he really going to give me a surprise? Two in a row, in one breath, a sword and a pass. The scariest thing is that he hasn't gone all out. He continues to break in."

Outside the trial, quite a few people had heard about it. Marshall Ancestor looked at the crowd swarming in, stroked his chin, and said with a smile, "Are you guys here to break through the barrier or are you here to watch the show?" When the crowd heard this, they hurriedly said, "We want to know the latest situation of Luu's breakthrough. Wouldn't it be nice to spend some credits watching it live?" Wuzu said with a smile. "Spent," someone said awkwardly. "As a result, that Luu just made it through the level with just one sword, and then had to spend credits to watch a new breakthrough. After gritting my teeth and spending credits, he ended up passing the level with just one sword again. Yeah, there's definitely something wrong with this mechanism. The person who set it up probably didn't expect that someone could speed through it." Another person spoke up. Listening to the crowd sputtering, Marshall Ancestor stroked his beard and smiled, then spoke, "At this moment, he has already broken through the fourth layer." "Sure enough, outrageous!" Hearing this, the crowd looked at each other in disbelief, and they could all see the complex look in each other's eyes. There was shock, envy, and even jealousy. The fourth floor was so difficult that it almost stopped the vast majority of the older students, and he actually broke through this. This is really too much. The result is the next second the Marshall Ancestor, however, was not surprised by his words. Moreover, he still killed the fourth level's Guardian with just one sword. "He hasn't used his full strength yet." The word just fell out, and the crowd was struck by lightning, their jaws dropped. "This... how is that possible?" Fourth shift, this chapter is a reward plus chapter 150.

Here is a revised version of the text, with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

As a result, a four-year-old kid had broken through the fourth floor of the guardian, and yet, he did so with a sword, appearing smooth and calm. He lost face, really. The fourth level of the secret realm of Trials had always been a barrier that most students at Blue Star University struggled to overcome. The reason was simple: the first, second, and third layers were considered Dharma layers, but the fourth, fifth, and sixth layers were considered the Dharma void. Students with Dharma bodies versus Dharma phases were at a significant disadvantage, making it extremely difficult to break through. For the vast majority of Blue Star University students, even those who were about to graduate, breaking through the fourth floor was nearly impossible. Only a few geniuses from the Jinshin school district were able to break through the fourth and fifth layers. No one expected that after only half a year of enrollment, Luu had killed the fourth level's Guardian with a single sword. This was sheer madness. The news went viral, and the entire Blue Star University began to discuss it. Old Professor Zuo Yuan was shocked when he heard the news: "Good boy, good boy, one sword and he's broken through the fourth floor. This is the Dharma phase, and he's achieved it in such a short time? I'll have to see how he does on the fifth level." Without much thought, Zuo Yuan hastily opened a live broadcast and watched along with many professors, including Zian. Each had also opened a live stream to watch Luu's breakthrough.

The Secret World of Trials, fifth floor. A turquoise prayer fluttered around the fifth level Guardian, who looked down at Luu with a hint of surprise. A little fellow from the Third Realm, how did you break in here? He felt incredible. Since the trial mystery realm was created up until today, it was the first time that a youngster from the Third Realm had broken through to the fifth floor. Luu raised the long sword in his hand and said with a smile, "Well, I chopped my way here." At these words, the gatekeeper narrowed his eyes. This little guy was quite something, obviously he was only at the Third Realm, but the aura on his body actually made him feel apprehensive. Without a hint of bravado, the gatekeeper smiled and said, "Well, you'll get to show me what kind of skills you actually have." Only after the words were spoken did a burst of shadows appear around his body, but in a split second, a giant over 100m tall CLA in battle armor directly rose up from the ground. The Dharma realm of the fifth compared to the Dharma void of the fourth level was really quite a bit stronger. On Luu's side, the Phantom gradually emerged, and he saw a vicious silhouette with a green face and fangs and Vermilion hair holding a long sword also rising up from the ground, though it was a head shorter than the battle-armored giant.

Seeing this scene, the gatekeeper sneered, "Really powerful; your ability to condense a Dharma phase Shadow at only the Third Realm is no wonder you managed to break through here." The gatekeeper didn't hesitate and directly swung his sword down. Luu also swung his sword and chopped out. The collision of the sword and knife erupted a violent fluctuation that made the entire fifth floor space tremble for a moment, the ground shook. The battle was incredibly fierce. However, it was not enough; the 100 meter tall Guardian laughed and said, "Let me see what you're all about." Another violent collision, Luu's silhouette was nearly unable to maintain itself. He gradually showed signs of collapsing under the constant, head-to-head exchanges. If this continues, defeat was only a matter of time, but... nothing more than that, you lose the gatekeeper said with a big smile, deciding to give Luu a fatal blow. Boom! Luu's Dharma phase was knocked backward continuously, and the Dharma phase's Shadow became more and more blurred, for a moment it was as if defeat had been decided.

Blue Star University, many older students sub(consciously) breathed a sigh of relief as they watched the scene. "Lose it! It's finally time to lose. He should have stopped at the fifth floor; still, it's quite anticlimactic." "Yeah, I've never seen such a fierce freshman, and the point is, he's only that small. He has the posture of a Marshall Saint. How can we compare?" "It's a pity. In a few months, the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle will begin. If only we had given him a few more years..." Someone suddenly realized something was wrong. "Luu's phallic Shadow looks like it's about to collapse at any moment." It turned out to be a long fight, and it hadn't crashed yet. The fifth level Guardian glared and once again used a killing move. Luu's faltering Dharma phase froze and still didn't collapse. "What's going on here?" Fong Guang, the principal of Blue Star University, couldn't help but say, "Good boy... he actually sensed the other party's Dharma phase; he's really gutsy, and the strength is really strong. It's all the way to the fifth layer, and he's still this easy to navigate. He's been shaking for so long, but he actually hasn't collapsed yet. That's quite a pretense, but he's easy to play off at this rate. It should be over."

The Secret World of Trials, fifth floor. The gatekeeper had gone completely crazy, his eyes red.

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

He kept swinging the large knife in his hand, seemingly defying the idea that he was no match for this formidable Powerhouse, slicing and dicing him with ease. The key to the phallic phase transitioning from the virtual to the real was rooted in the number of inscriptions fused together – the more inscriptions combined, the stronger the power of the pH became. Unfortunately, I am unable to do so for the time being; I need to continue to cultivate and enlighten myself. I must be patient in this battle. Luu raised his head, and so did his phallic Shadow, the long sword in his hand glinting menacingly in the light. Sword Prison was a move he had used before, but now it did so in the Dharma phase. The effect was described as vastly different from before; the spherical sword prison, with a diameter of thousands of meters, enveloped the Guardians of the fifth level, rendering them immobile. The gatekeeper froze, his furious face transformed into a momentary act of astonishment. "It's just the fledgling form of a domain," Luu said with a smile, "but against you, it's already enough. You can die." 

Chapter 151: Heaven's Pride Battle Selection

When Luu faced the Powerhouse on the ninth floor of the Reincarnation Tower, Sword Prison was little more than an afterthought, failing to cause any damage at all. That feeling of powerlessness still lingered, a stark reminder of how much time had passed. And yet, as Luu's strength increased, so too did his understanding of the move. Eventually, the fifth floor gatekeeper nearly recognized the wrong person in Luu's transformed stance, the faint aura of his prowess suddenly visible. Without hesitation, Luu swung his sword down in an instant. The sky erupted with flashes of sword light, like a meat grinder tearing through the guardian's body with ease. Sweat flowed from the guardian's face, and he desperately tried to resist, but Luu's sword defying attacks left him little time to react. The guardian's resistance was annihilated in the next instant; the barrier Keeper's huge body collapsed like a mountain peak, toppling to the ground in a spectacular display of force. Luu's face remained resolute, his eyes gazing into the distance, observing the scenery with a hint of a waste of time, yet always breaking through. Continue to rise to the sixth floor. Luu broke through the fifth level of the secret realm of Trials. The aged Professor Z looked at the live broadcast screen and couldn't help but speak out in amazement. It was the fifth level, and yet Luu seemed so effortlessly adept. Jude remembered that a few months ago, he had shocked the world by mastering the first layer in just a few hours, a feat that left everyone in awe of his accelerated growth. 

Now, only a few months had passed since then, and Luu was facing the formidable Dharma phase powerhouses of the fifth level, effortlessly breaking through the growth rate that had once fascinated everyone. Even Professor Li Guang Tha was perusing the live broadcast with a look of dismay on his face. "It's him," he whispered. "The little guy from the past, now a powerhouse of the fifth level." Li Guang Tha recalled that he had mentored the same young Luu, who had long ago asked him to teach him martial arts. Li Guang Tha then smiled, remembering that a long time ago, the young Luu had asked him so many questions. "Tell me, Lu you," Li Guang Tha asked, "What do you want to learn?" Luu replied without thinking, "I want to learn martial arts." Li Guang Tha smiled. "Why martial arts?" Luu simply stated without hesitation, "I want to become stronger like Wangai." Li Guang Tha pressed on, aware that the memory of that occasion still lingered in his mind. That sense of wonder was still fresh in his mind. The past seemed indelibly marked on his being.  That was all so long ago. Meanwhile, another person, Fong Guang, the president of Blue Star University, watched the scene unfold in amazement in his office. His eyes lit up, and he let out a sigh of admiration. "I didn't expect this rate of progress from Luu," he muttered. "If we follow this rate, there's a chance we might just participate in the Heavenly Pride battle selection. Perhaps his strength is fast enough to get us into the tenth tier battle." A spark of excitement ignited within him. Fong Wang decided to instruct the AI to announce the news of the battle selection and sent it to the students of Blue Star University. He called for all the students to pass the seventh level of the trial of the secret realm. Those who emerged victorious at the sixth level would obtain their qualifications for participating in the battle. And as for the fifth level –  he explained – one would have to pass the campaign elections.

The Major General rank and a reward of 100 billion star dollars, one piece of supreme treasure, three pieces of heavy treasure, and the opportunity to worship the Martial Emperor were announced. This news spread quickly throughout Blue Star University, causing a frenzy among the students. The Medal of Honor, extraordinary even among star Marshals, has been issued only a few hundred times in the past 2,000 years, and its gold content speaks for itself, making it an honor that could support a martial arts family.

The rank of Major General already carries a high status, but with the additional rewards, it was a dizzying array that left many breathless. With this one email, the attention of the secret realm of Trials immediately rose several notches, and news of Luu's crazy breakthrough spread further.

After a few months, Lu you broke through again, directly from the second floor to the sixth floor, and came with a handful of Speedy passes to The Secret World of Trials and Tribulations. It seemed that he was also going to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle.

Byu Jing, who was cultivating slowly, opened her eyes and nodded slightly upon reading the latest email. The selection conditions for the human race's Heavens Pride battle had been announced, and it was a generous reward that could change one's life. It was enough to make any student's heart flutter.

Suddenly, Byu Jing saw something and furrowed her pretty brows. Little Luu was breaking through the sixth layer, and he had easily broken through the fifth layer. Byu Jing blinked her beautiful eyes, her eyes filled with disbelief. How long had it been since they last saw each other, and he had become so strong? She couldn't believe it. Luu was almost caught up with her, and she was close to graduating. Plus, she had been practicing hard for so many years in the Jinshin school district, and she had only gotten this far. How old was he? Four years old? Cousin son, what a horror! She knew he had the stature of a marshal saint, but at least grow up slowly, right? Didn't he have a bottleneck in his cultivation?

Among the young people of the B family's generation, Bing's Talent was the best. She had been hailed as a genius among geniuses since she was a child and simply couldn't meet any rivals in her peer group. It was not until she reached Blue Star University that she encountered a Celestial Pride that barely pressed her head, and she was still far ahead of the others. Now, compared to Luu, her proud cultivation talent was nothing at all. The sense of contrast was just too much.

Byu Jing felt not long ago that this little Luu was even words that could not be said. The result of a turn of the eye was so strong. An estate in the town's theological School District, a quiet room, the only student who had broken through the seventh floor looked at the male with calm eyes without any surprises. He got the place in the heavens Pride battle suddenly he noticed something and there was some surprise in his eyes. "Luu, the son of the Marshall Saint, is breaking through the sixth floor? Isn't he only 3 or 4 years old?"

Chapter 152: Fighting Spirit
Nearly a month of Enlightenment time, Sia looked at the email message with some confusion. He had long heard of Luu's reputation as a genius at a young age, and he possessed the posture of a marshal saint before that. He had even broken through the first level of the secret realm of Trials, but no matter how much of a genius Luu was, he was still only in the second or third realm. Wanting to become completely stronger was something for later. It would take at least seven or eight years, if not a decade, to grow up gradually. The future belonged to him, but Summercliff was not expecting it at all.

In just a few months, Luu had broken through the fifth level of the trial Mystic realm. What's that supposed to mean? Was he going to break through the sixth layer or even the seventh layer and then join himself in the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle? A 4-year-old little guy representing the human race in the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle? Are you kidding me? Is there no one left in the human race? Summercliff felt a little ridiculous but had to admit it. But it was such a ridiculous thing to do. Obviously, the next generation of Genius is just caught up by Leaps and Bounds, no reasoning whatsoever.

Perched halfway up the mountain, the colossal figure was resting his body, with most of it towering above the clouds. Suddenly, he realized something and looked down, then opened his mouth to speak with a voice that boomed like a thunderous explosion. "A mere little fellow of the Third Realm, to be able to walk here, it's quite interesting."

Lu looked up at the looming Giant in the distance, and his face became serious. He thought of the Giant on the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower back then. At this moment, this giant was even more terrifying than the one on the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower. If the Dharma Giant on the ninth level of The Reincarnation Tower was the seventh and eighth levels of Dharma, then this giant in front of him was the ninth level of the Dharma phase, standing 10,000 ft tall. His head was like a mountain peak, his waist was like a steep mountain, his eyes were like thunder pools, his mouth was like an abyss, and his teeth were like dangerous peaks. He was a true law of the heavens.

Obviously, the difficulty skyrocketed with every level you broke through. The Phantoms cast by The Intruders at the fifth level were no more than a few hundred meters tall. Lu dealt with it with ease. The sixth level Guardian should be around a few thousand meters tall, but the result was straight to tens of thousands of meters. This made Lu realize that there was trouble, but the stronger the opponent, the more you have to break in.

Guardian Lu raised his head and shouted, "Please also let me feel the strongest strength of the ninth level of the Dharma phase." The Towering giant laughed and responded, "Then I'm afraid you won't be able to support yourself for a moment, but if you say so, then as you wish. I'll let you feel what it means to be a true Dharma Heaven."

Saying so, he just glared, and above the sky, instantly dark clouds and thunder surged, wind to my aid, rain to help me, Ray come help me. In a split second, the howling wind was more than just a gale, and the large trees that several people had embraced were directly uprooted. The rain was as if seawater was pouring down, directly from the sky, creating an instant flood. The Thunder was like a thunder dragon probing downwards from the clouds, followed by a dive directly pouncing towards Lu. This is the true law of Heaven and Earth.

Lu's heart was appalled, and without the slightest hesitation, the Dharma FAS Shadow immediately swung out a sword pull, sword prison, boom, boom, boom, boom. The Thunder Dragons that swoop down collided with the sword prison continuously, and the explosions rose and fell in succession. In just an instant, the sword prison, which had been invincible just moments ago, was already shaking.

Sure enough, it's worthy of being a full body of the Dharma phase. It's too strong. Lu couldn't help but sigh in his heart. Even though he was facing such a strong enemy, he did not have the slightest fear. His eyes grew brighter and brighter, and his battle intent grew thicker and thicker. Lu knew that he could not sit back and wait for death and instead of retreating, he advanced and swung his sword.

Return to the ruins. Legend has it that hundreds of millions of miles east of the bohi see, there is an unfathomable Gully called The Returning ruins. This is the place where all things end and return. This sword is called ruin, and it is also the sword that ends everything and destroys everything. Before coming to Blue Star University, Jia Wuan taught Lu this sword. Even Lu's World unrivaled talent in the sword da had just barely mastered this move. Using it at this moment is really a matter of necessity because only the sword could threaten this Behemoth.

Whether it was the Lumen sword light or the demon Punisher, even the sword prison, it was difficult to have much effect. The difference in strength between each other was too obvious. Lu had only barely grasped the Dharma phase void while the other party was the ninth weight of the actual Dharma phase. As this returning ruin sword slashed out, the Pangian giant was slightly stunned. He had actually sensed an aura of danger. This how could this be possible?

Without the slightest hesitation, he raised his hand again, Ray come help me. Above the sky, dark clouds rolled as if there were Thunder pools pouring down, and countless Thunder Dragons pounced towards Lu. Boom, boom, boom, boom, the thunder dragon collided with the sword and was annihilated as much as possible. However, the number of brontosaurus was just too much. Thousands of Thunder Dragons going forward and back pounced madly, not giving Lu a chance to catch his breath at all. Boom, Dash, violent explosions rang out. Lu eliminated, breaking into the sixth floor.

Seeing this scene, many of the veteran students of Blue Star University couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. "Finally, lost. I thought he could break through the sixth floor. Yeah, scared me to death. That last sword was kind of awesome." Facing thousands of Thunder Dragons, all of them supported it for so long. In the entire Blue Star University, there are only a handful of people who have broken through to the sixth floor. If he breaks through, then the pressure on me, me, we'll be too great.

"Okay, okay, this Lu is breaking through so violently. Is he going to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle? Huh, are you kidding me? He's only four. What's wrong with four?"

"He's only seven years old. If he breaks through the seventh floor, will he still be forbidden to go to the next level? How is that possible? How is it impossible?"

These words left the person arguing momentarily speechless, but they quickly retorted, "That's not possible, is it? His realm is still too low. Without a Dharma body, sensing the Dharma phase will be twice as difficult. He's only now condensing the Dharma phase void. Without a few years, it's impossible for him to reach the ninth level of the Dharma phase. Moreover, even the ninth level of the Dharma phase can't break through the seventh level of the trial Mystic realm - the seventh layer is already at the level of a domain. There are still a few months left until the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. Even if he's a demon, he won't make it."

Despite his defeat, Luu appeared in high spirits, a faint smile on his face as he looked around. "If you break through a layer, you can participate in the enlightenment here for seven days. I just broke through the second, third, fourth, and fifth floors in one breath. That is to say, I can participate in Enlightenment here for almost a month."

Chapter 153: "Is there no upper limit to inscription comprehension in the secret realm of Trials?" Many students came one after another, seeing this scene. Wuu couldn't help but smile. "It seems like that kid has brought a lot of pressure to this group of students to break through to the sixth level. At the Third Realm, this is considered unprecedented. Although he has a treasure on him that can make up for the energy gap, that thing alone is not enough to support him to the sixth floor. This kind of natural Talent is only comparable to that student who broke through the ninth floor a long time ago. It is said that he later became the only Marshall saint of the human race. It seems like there's hope for this kid too."

The Marshall ancestor blinked, looked up at the students lined up, and with a big wave of his hand, the doors leading to the various levels opened one after another.

In the meantime, Luu sat cross-legged within his body, the Taiumortal cell Taiudhad Dan was slowly running, which made the process of Enlightenment twice as effective. However, even with the help of the Tiuemortal cells and Tuidiffractive Dharma pills, it would be difficult for Luu to advance by Leaps and Bounds.

Luu furrowed his brows at this rate. Even if he were to participate in Enlightenment here for a month, he would only be able to step into the fifth level of the Dharma phase or so. This speed, compared to others, is already very fast. However, for Luu, it was not enough. The current progress was to break through the fifth floor, not even the sixth. Breaking through the seventh floor was even further away, and it was not even certain that he would get a place to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle.

Luu let out a deep breath and thought, "Calm down and think about it a little. The top celestials of the 10,000 races of the universe had cultivated diligently for more than ten years or even decades before moving from Dharma body to Dharma phase and then to realm. Now, he's trying to catch up in just a few months. Not too difficult, maybe, but if it was really that simple to do, then the so-called Heavenly Pride of the 10,000 races of the universe would become a bunch of jokes. Difficulty to the point of Despair is the norm. However, even though he knew this, Luu did not have the slightest thought of giving up. He thought hard about the solution. After a long time, an aura flashed through his mind. Luu's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but murmur, 'Since it's too difficult for me at this stage to comprehend the fusion inscriptions and perfect the Dharma phase, wouldn't it be better for me to continue comprehending inscriptions? Although I have mastered 301 inscriptions, I am far from reaching the bottleneck. As long as more inscriptions are mastered, the foundation will also become more solid. At that time, fusing the inscriptions and perfecting the phases should become relatively easier.' This is a stupid way, but right now, I can't form a Dharma body, so I can only use this stupid way."

Thinking this way, Luu immediately redirected his cultivation and continued to Envision the new inscription. At the same time, he was also a bit curious about the upper limit of inscriptions he could master. He wondered, "What is it? The average Genius of the human race mastering 199 inscriptions is already the limit. But he's already mastered 301 inscriptions. That's not even his limit. This Enlightenment was nearly a month's worth of time. Opening his eyes again, Luu's eyes continuously flashed with inscriptions, his expression a little subtle. Luu just wanted to make the foundation stronger so that he could use it to perfect the Dharma phase with the Mastery of one inscription."

After successive breakthroughs, it seemed as if Luu had no limits. Intrigued, he explored the extent of his capabilities. As the cultivation time neared its end, Luu had mastered 500 inscriptions, nearly doubling his initial count of 301. This was remarkable, as even rare races with natural talents possessed only between 300 and 400 inscriptions. Luu surpassed these rare races in the number of mastered inscriptions, which was overwhelming.

The superb effects of pills like Dowo Embryo, Pill, Dragon Tiger Golden Pill, Jade Bone Pill, and Jade Lotus Root Golden Pill significantly exceeded expectations. Under their transformative influence, Luu's upper limit increased significantly. Time was running out, and Luu decided to leave the Inscription Stone Tablet Hall. The enlightenment he gained from this experience required digestion.

Upon exiting the secret realm of Trials, Luu headed straight to the Xin Shendow Field. He wanted to organize and absorb the numerous benefits he had acquired. Breaking through four levels of trial mysteries consecutively, Luu now possessed numerous credits, and staying in the Xin Shin Dojo for a year would not be an issue.

A month passed, and the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride selection tournament commenced. Auditions were held across various martial arts universities, arenas, and private martial arts schools. However, only martial artists in the fifth realm could participate. Most golden body realm practitioners were eliminated in the first round. Only the strongest dharma body realm practitioners could progress further, but they would still be eliminated eventually.

In the dharma body realm, those who had mastered the dharma phase were the true leaders, dominating the major planets' auditions. The absolute Heavenly Pride, who had mastered the domain, had not yet entered the fray. This was normal, as they had already secured their spots in the Heaven Pride battle and did not need to participate in the selection round.

As the tryouts continued, the occasional appearance of the Cold Family's pride became a topic of conversation. Some people even compiled a list of human Celestial Pride contenders for the Heaven Pride battle. This list included 50 names, with Sia of Blue Star University ranked first. He had broken through three levels of the secret trial realm, becoming the deserved king of newcomers.

Wu Wy of the military martial arts university ranked second, having mastered the domain and stepped into the third mountain of the three military mountains of the military Marshall University. Gawan of Star Martial Arts University ranked third, having also mastered the domain and climbed to the top of the Star Marshall University points ranking.

Luu also made it onto this human race Heavens Pride ranking, with an overall ranking of 49th. His impressive performance in breaking through the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels of the trial mysteries consecutively earned him this position. Although he lost at the sixth level, his overall performance was commendable.

With three realms separating Luu from the top, it would be challenging to make up for this gap in a short period. However, given enough time, Luu's growth rate suggested that he could progress further. In the next few months of cultivation, he was bound to advance, but whether he could reach the number one spot on the Heavens Pride ranking remained uncertain.

Undisputed number one in the Heavenly Pride ranking, representing the human race to fight in the 10,000 races Heavenly Pride battle, and will certainly be able to get good results. Unfortunately, the distance from the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride wore only the last few months left time was not on Luu's side. From here, it could be seen that the person who made the move to compile the human race as Heaven's Pride ranking could be said to have his hands in the air with a staggeringly large number of intelligence channels and was able to calculate every aspect. As soon as this human race Heaven's Pride list came out, it quickly caused a huge uproar around this list. The entire human community was in a heated discussion. Those who were on the list were somewhat unconvinced when they saw their names as well as their rankings.
"Why am I on this list?" As the discussion intensifies, it's only the audition stage, and the heat is already exploding from all sides. Blue Star University, the sixth level of the secret realm of trials, two Phantoms tens of thousands of meters tall were in a fierce physical battle. On one side was the gatekeeper, and on the other side was Chu Xiao, a senior at Blue Star University Jinshin School District. After a thousand rounds of intense sparring between the two sides, the guardian's head was finally blown off by a punch.
"Level six pass. I'm going to break through the seventh floor." Shujao's eyes are bright as if he is getting more and more courageous. As a result, when they reached the seventh level, as the gatekeeper unfolded his domain, Shujao, who had defeated the ninth level of the Dharma phase, was strangled in just a few rounds. The seventh level of the secret realm of Trials without half of his body, Bayu Jing's eyes were still bright as he stared deathly at the Domain Powerhouse in the distance, almost sadly.
"Still almost. Although I have already mastered a portion of the domain, the intensity is really too low. If I cultivate for a few more months, I might have a chance to break through the seventh layer." Thinking like this, BYU Jing's breath grew weaker and weaker, and then his eyes went black, and he was directly eliminated from the eighth level of the secret realm of Trials.
The two domains clashed madly against each other. It's just a matter of moments, and Sia then fell into the wind for a moment. It was impossible to attack and could only barely parry and passively defend. So strong, he raised his head and frowned as he looked at the gatekeeper of this level.
"I've already stepped into the third level of the domain, but I'm still in such a sorry State. The guards at this level are at least domain 5. It's only a difference of two weights, but the Gap is still so big. If I can't break through the eighth floor, I'm afraid I'll have a hard time getting good grades in the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle." Earlier, as the human race Heaven's remarkable ranking came out, his name was quite literally ranked first. However, Sia did not have the slightest bit of Pride because he knew very well that the intensity of the competition in the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle was Far Beyond imagination. This amount of his strength was nothing. It's hard as hell to get a top ranking.
Boom, Dash with a violent explosion, Sia was eliminated outright. Military Armed Forces University, the secret Realm of the three Army Mountain, third Mountain, Wua continuously roared.
"By what right am I second?" By what right, his domain continued to unfold, eliminating monster after Monster. I don't know how much time had passed, but Woo, covered in blood, suddenly widened his eyes and his face was filled with ecstasy.
"I've realized it. Turns out to be so. This is the fourth level of the domain." Star Martial Arts University, Virtual Worlds. However, in the blink of an eye, Gan defeated 100 Dharma body martial artists. This caused the old Professor next to him to nod frequently.
"Your Mastery of the domain is getting more and more subtle."
"Not enough 100 more, no 200 more." Gawan shouted.
"Good." The old professor said with a smile.
Then, he set it to a Siege of 300 Dharma body powerhouses. As the time for the cosmic 10,000 races Heavenly Pride battle Drew nearer and nearer, the entire human race's Prides one by one all felt a huge pressure and all began to cultivate frantically, constantly refining themselves. Time is gradually passing. 3 months have passed in the blink of an eye. A lot has happened in these past three months.
First, it was Blue Star University's Byeing who had broken through the seventh level of the trial mystery realm and in one breath had rushed to fifth place on the heavens Pride ranking, booking his ticket to the 10,000 races Heavenly Pride battle in advance. Then, it was Military Marshall University's Woy who had gone even further in the three Army Mountain. Not only mastering the fourth level of the domain but also comprehending a mastery, squeezing Seak Cliff out of first place in Blue Star University. Many senior students one after another broke through the sixth layer of the trial mystery realm and in the subsequent Heavenly Pride battle selection competition, they were unbeatable.
During this period of time, on the Heaven's remarkable ranking, the ranking rotation was quite intense. Luu, who was still in 49th Place, was squeezed out early. Even if the heavens remarks ranking expanded to 100 later, he was still invisible. Fewer and fewer people are talking about him. That's normal. After all, in the opinion of the vast majority of people, Luu's realm was too low, and it would have been impossible for him to go

To the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle, wait a few more years before it's his time. Meanwhile, there was only one month left before the start of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle, and the auditions had also come to an end. The final rankings were about to be contested. Jin Shen Dojo's Luu slowly opened his eyes. After three months of hard work, he had made great progress. He had mastered 921 inscriptions, and among them, 781 were in tandem. The number of fused inscriptions was 12, as expected. At first, the more inscriptions he mastered, the more solid his foundation became, and the easier it was to fuse inscriptions in comparison. During these three months, Luu didn't practice alone; he occasionally returned to seek advice from his master, and his old father would also teach him regularly. This caused Luu to make rapid progress. His Dharma was much more perfect, and his battle power had increased on all fronts. The only thing unfortunate was that his field progress was minimal. Breaking through the sixth floor shouldn't be too much of a problem, but whether he could break through the seventh floor was still unknown. According to the onlookers, without entering the realm, no matter how strong the Dharma phase was, it was impossible to break through the seventh layer. Despite this, Luu still decided to give it a try. After all, no one else had mastered 921 inscriptions.

Three months in seclusion, and Luu finally arrived. The Marshall ancestor immediately brightened up and said with a smile, "Little fellow, it's been a long time. You've gotten stronger again." Chapter 55: No, what makes his Dharma face so strong? The moment the Marshall ancestor spoke, the crowd, who were still quietly lining up, immediately looked over. "It's him! After three months of seclusion, you finally can't help it. I wonder how many floors he can break into this time. Break through the sixth floor or even the seventh? Unlikely. Although his talent is heaven-defying and his rate of progress is terrifying, this is the Dharma phase and domain level. The realm is too low and too difficult to comprehend. We'll see how it turns out. Wait and see what he does." These people murmured, each a little curious about the results of Luu's seclusion.

Luu looked towards the Marshall ancestor and greeted him with a smile. "Grandpa Marshall ancestor, long time no see. The sixth layer just happened to have an empty slot, so you can directly go and break through." The Marshall ancestor waved his hand and said with a smile, "The reward I promised you last time, I haven't given it to you yet. If this time you can break through the seventh layer, I'll give you a good thing." Luu was slightly stunned by this, then nodded. "Good." The crowd in line was stunned to hear this. "Woo! This means that Luu can definitely break through the sixth floor, and only the seventh floor is considered a challenge." Meanwhile, Luu had already passed through the teleportation portal and arrived in the battle space on the sixth level amidst the mountains.

The Towering giant lowered his head. "Little fellow of the Third Realm, you're here again. These days, the sixth floor has seen a number of trespassers come one after another, but there has been no second trespasser from the Third Realm other than Luu." The gatekeeper said. "I'm here again," Luu laughed, then said loudly, "Please also give it your all." The gatekeeper glared, and Heaven and Earth changed color as dark clouds tumbled and Thunder Dragons emerged. Le stepped on the white Jade Wind and Fire wheel and raised his head to watch the wind and clouds rise, quietly observing the transformation of Heaven and Earth. The Gale kept whistling, uprooting a tree, and flying sand and stones hovered. The scene was like the arrival of the end of the world. Luu, however, did not move at all, as if he was a c pin standing in midair.

Rumble Dash! A huge thunder dragon swooped down from the dark clouds and attacked towards Luu. However, when it was about to hit Luu, it was as if it had hit a wall of air and automatically collapsed. "I don't know when it started, but the sword prison space has enveloped the surrounding heaven and Earth, and a small head of thunder dragon cannot be shaken at all." The gatekeeper knew that Luu had gotten stronger and more than a little bit stronger. Without the slightest hesitation, he directly summoned 10,000 Thunder Dragons. In the next instant, it was like a thunder pool tipping over, as countless Thunder Dragons successively pounced. Luu's face did not change at all, but as he quietly watched the scene, he couldn't help but feel emotion in his heart. The law of Heaven and Earth, also known as the law of Heaven and Earth, had been able to utilize the natural climate to attack opponents. The essence of the Dharma phase was the fusion of inscriptions, and the essence of inscriptions was the power of Heaven and Earth. It was part of the rules, a materialization of the laws, one of the essences of this universe. A few months ago, he had only a superficial and shallow understanding of all this and was unable to realize the essence at all. But now, after mastering so many inscriptions, he had a whole new understanding of the power of Heaven and Earth, of the materialization of laws. Sure enough, just as he suspected, even if it was the same Dharma phase, there was a big difference because of the different

Having mastered 921 inscriptions, I've become significantly stronger. Is this a whole new path? Will there be a qualitative change when I master 1,000 inscriptions in a few days? Three months ago, Luu was powerless against this ninth level Dharma Guardian, only able to marvel at his opponent's power and terror. But now, even as thousands of Thunder Dragons bombarded the sword prison space, Luu remained unmoved, showing not the slightest sign of collapsing. 

At this moment, Luu hadn't yet reached the ninth level of the Dharma phase, but due to the number of inscriptions he had mastered, he was terrifyingly powerful. Instead, the opponent appeared outwardly foolish. Without the slightest hesitation, Luu raised his hand and struck. His sword pierced through, returning to the ruins as this single strike caused thousands of Thunder Dragons to collapse. The dark clouds in the sky were sliced in half, the gusty winds stopped abruptly, and the torrential rain vanished above. The guardian stared at the sword in shock, and before he could react, his massive head rolled down. Then, the guardian's enormous body fell to the ground, smashing mountains and rivers, and cracking the Earth.

"On to the seventh floor," Luu retrieved his long sword and continued to break through the barrier. He wanted to see where the so-called domain powerhouses were truly strong. As Luu broke through the sixth layer, the Marshall Ancestor's eyes immediately lit up, and he couldn't help but smile. "Not bad. With just one sword, you've broken through the sixth floor."

Hearing this, the people in the queue were stunned. "Who just one sword and breaking through the sixth layer?" This was too much. In the entire Blue Star University, there were only a handful of people who could do this. Someone couldn't help but ask, "Marshall Ancestor, Grandpa Marshall Ancestor, who exactly has broken through the sixth floor?"

Hearing this, the Marshall Ancestor glanced at the man and said in a somewhat strange manner, "Who else could it be besides Luu?"

Hearing this, the crowd looked at each other, all of them seeing the shock in each other's eyes. Even though they had already mentally prepared themselves for this, they all knew that Luu might break through the sixth floor. After all, the Marshall Ancestor had said something like that. To expect Luu to stop at the sixth floor would be a joke. So the sixth floor, you should be able to break through, but what they did not expect at all was for Luu to break through the sixth floor with just one sword. Many people were secretly staggered and couldn't help but mutter, "Will it really be possible to break through the seventh floor?" "Impossible! The seventh layer is a domain layer. I don't think so, but it's really possible that he broke through the sixth layer with a single sword. A four-year-old domain powerhouse? No kidding! I can't take it!"

The news went viral and attracted a lot of attention. At the time, Luu had broken through the sixth layer. This was not a surprise. In 3 months, with his terrifying growth rate, it could be considered very normal for him to progress again. However, he had killed a ninth level Dharma phase Powerhouse from the sixth level with a single sword, so it was not the same concept. For a while, these people opened the live stream to watch Luu's breakthrough live feed. Luu did not unfold his domain; he was still using the Phantom Plus Sword Prison, fiercely exchanging blows with the seventh level Guardians. Many people couldn't help but shake their heads when they saw this scene. "He hasn't mastered the domain yet. He only has a sword move that can barely be considered a domain prototype. It seems like he won't be able to break through to the seventh floor."

"That's right. The difference between a domain and a Dharma phase is too great. It's not on the same level at all."

"Yeah, a Dharma phase Powerhouse can never beat a domain Powerhouse. The gap is too big."

No one was optimistic about Luu, even though he had killed the sixth level Guardian with a single sword. The point of not having a domain doomed him to defeat. Right at this moment, someone spoke up, "If this is the case, then why is he able to pressure the seventh level domain Guardians to fight?"

At those words, several people around them froze, looking at the live feed again. One's expression became somewhat incredulous. "Yeah, what's going on here? Why is it that the Dharma phase can suppress the domain?"

"Nope, what makes his Phantom so strong?"

Here is a rewritten version of the text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

The gatekeeper smiled and nodded, then gently raised his hand, transforming the space around him into an extreme Darkness Field in an instant. The DSE field expanded crazily and enveloped the entire seventh floor, shrouding it in darkness so intense that it seemed to cling to everything. The sun and moon disappeared, and the sky and earth changed, as if trapped within the field. Luu was astounded to realize that he couldn't breathe, a sensation that was literal rather than an illusion. His domain, named the Great Dark Heaven, was a realm where he was god.

The gatekeeper looked at Luu with a faint smile and said indifferently, "Hurry up and make a move, or you'll never have a chance." Luu didn't take his words seriously and cast his Dharma phase, releasing his Sword Prison to counter the domain. The domain responded by activating its fledgling resistance, but Luu's Domain wasn't at all threatened by the counterattack. As the gatekeeper finished speaking, his expression changed, and a sword returned to ruin, tearing apart the domain with unimaginable force. The gatekeeper barely dodged just in time, looking at Luu with a mix of surprise and wonder. "How could your sword be so powerful?" he exclaimed. "If I had reacted a fraction of a second slower, we would have been over."

Luu didn't even give the gatekeeper time to catch his breath as he unleashed yet another devastating attack. The strength of this second sword was even greater than the first, and under its might, the darkness that shrouded the realm seemed to break apart. "Great Dark Heaven, flee!" the domain boomed, and black hands emerged from the void, lunging towards Luu. These were a special aspect of the domain, intent on ripping apart anyone who dared to enter. However, to the gatekeeper's dismay, Luu's sword was able to evade and deflect even these fearsome attacks.

As the battle raged on, the gatekeeper's expression changed from surprise to shock. "No way, this is impossible," he muttered. Luu's Domain continued to overwhelm him, tearing apart the realm, and the gatekeeper realized that his domain's strength was no match for his opponent. Finally, in a desperate attempt to turn the tide, the gatekeeper declared, "This is as far as I can go!"

Luu regarded him with disappointment and asked, "Is this the true power of your domain? Can you show me your true strength?" The gatekeeper's anger flared up, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. "Who's going to argue with that?" he exclaimed, realizing that under normal circumstances, his domain would indeed have been the superior force.

As the students watching the live broadcast on their screens witnessed this turn of events, they were stunned. "But this isn't scientific," one of them muttered. "There must be some mistake." Another student shook his head and exclaimed, "The Dharma phase martial artist is just too powerful, even the domain was torn apart by a single sword."

Fang Wang, an administrator at Blue Star University, watched the aftermath of the battle from his office. "It seems like once again, a seventh-level Guardian has been defeated," he noted. His colleague Yaga, the principal of the military's Marshall University, shook his head with a tinge of envy. "That Blue Star University really does have a lot of talent," he said. Fang Wang chuckled and asked, "Guess who this person is?"

Yaga shook his head, and Fang smiled mischievously. "Look who's fooling around! You know who it is," he whispered, grinning. Yaga raised an eyebrow and shook his head, "No... I don't believe it."

Here is the revised text with improved English:

The seventh layer earned the qualification to participate in the battle of the 10,000 Clans. Why wouldn't I be surprised? Yaga said with an unimpressed tone. "Is that so?" Fong Wang replied with a smile. "What if I tell you that this student who broke through the seventh layer is the son of the Marshall saint?" the four-year-old Liu asked as soon as he heard those words, Yaga's eyes widened, and he was a bit incredulous for a moment. "Who did you just say he was?" Liu Fong Wang repeated with a smile. Yaga's scalp was a bit numb, and he couldn't help but say, "I remember, he's only four years old and his realm is only the Third Realm. How could he possibly break through the seventh floor? You're not kidding, no kidding honestly. I also feel incredible, but that's the truth." Fong Wang shook his head and couldn't help but exclaim in admiration. "Truly unexpected. He actually broke through to the seventh floor, took the ticket to the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. Reserving tickets for the heavens Pride battle." Schwan wo! How did he break through? Yaga couldn't help but ask. Just four years old and he's able to master the domain; The Marshall saints back then weren't this perverted, were they? He doesn't seem to have mastered the domain yet. Fong Wang frowned. "Didn't Master the domain?" Yaga was even more surprised then. "How did he break through the seventh floor?" Just take a look, Fong Guang was also a bit curious and hurriedly pulled up the video of the break-in and began to watch it. Yauga, who was on the side, also looked over curiously. "Ha! Just after looking at them for a while, the two Wu Presidents stared with white eyes. This isn't right; the strength of this fantasm is very off. He's actually able to resist the tearing of the domain. How many inscriptions does this son of the Marshall Saint have? The completion of the fantasm is closely related to the fusion of inscriptions, but the strength of the fantasm is also directly related to the number of inscriptions. What a fierce sword! He's almost mastered the essence of this sword. The Dharma phase is pressing down on the domain. I never dreamed that this would happen. This little Marshall saint of ours is too Heaven-defying." The duo watched the break-in video and couldn't help but tsk, tsk, tsk in amazement. "By virtue of Dharma alone," it overcame the realm. "Wait until the seventh floorkeeper falls; When this news spreads, the other Universities' Heavenly Prides, one by one, I'm afraid they'll be struck down. It's good to stimulate them. The top seedlings of this session of the heavens Pride battle are too few." Fong shook his head and said with a smile. "Also, the heaven's remarkable ranking can be updated again. This Lou's ranking is well... it's good to be ranked fifth; you're still as wicked as ever." Yaga didn't know how to comment on the fact that the hallowed Marshall Emperor, the chancellor of Blue Star University, had secretly made a human Celestial Pride ranking. If This Were to be rumored, I am afraid it would make many people's jaws drop. Soon, the official website of the human heavens Pride ranking rankings are updated; the rankings change, and this message automatically pushed to all subscribers. Initially, these people did not care, just casually glanced at, at the changes in this phase of the heavens pride list. What kind of ranking changes? Then, they saw that Liu's name, which appeared in the fifth position, "Aha! Many people couldn't help but squint their eyes when they saw the scene and thought they had misread it. But this is clearly not a misreading. The fifth place, indeed, is Liu Shady. This is definitely Shady. Isn't it? Yu was almost invisible in this list before. How could he suddenly Scamper up to fifth? He's only four years old. How come he's ranked fifth on the human Race's Heavens Pride ranking? This is too ridiculous. People who saw this scene couldn't help but spit out the black mail thinking that the owner of this website is using his power for personal gain. A Discerning I can see the problem at a glance. During these recent months, Yu was completely silent. How did you get to fifth place all of a sudden? It's not that he doesn't have the talent. Quite the contrary; Yu was the one whose talent was the strongest of all. But he's too young. He's only four this year. Before and after, his cultivation was only 2 years. Suddenly ranked fifth on the heavens Pride ranking could it be that this time in the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle, Yu is also going to fight? What a joke. Regardless of what the foodie spews this human Pride ranking is a reason list of reasons. Four months ago, Yu was at Blue Star University breaking through four levels of the trial mysteries in a row and ranked 49th on the heavens pride list at the time. Unfortunately, he has been completely silent since then. Gradually being overtaken by others and ranking outside the top 100 overall. Yet, these four months of hard training have allowed his strength to skyrocket. Just now, he broke through the sixth and seventh layers of the trial Mystic realm in one breath, becoming the current Blue Star University's third student to break through the seventh layer. It is worth noting that Yu has not mastered the domain and is using the Dharma phase realm to fight against the domain realm, forcing his way through this level. This performance is unparalleled. The number of inscriptions he has mastered, I'm afraid it's very terrifying. Which leads to the extremely high strength of the phallic phase, making the general.

Realm Realm holds no power over him whatsoever, which is the key to reversing the phallic phases of the realm, as far as comprehensive performance is concerned. A first or second level domain martial artist is no match for him, thus placing him in the fifth position of the Heavens Pride ranking.

As soon as the Heavens Pride list was released, major news outlets picked up the story and rushed to cover it. Numerous front-page headlines with direct, bold headlines read: "Luu, Son of the Marshall Saint, May Represent the Human Race in the 10,000 Races Heavenly Pride Battle"; "TL List Updated: Fifth Place Changes Hands - You'll Never Guess Who It Is"; "The Strongest Heavens Pride in History Makes an Appearance".

There are still variables in the candidate for the human race's Heaven's Pride battle. The first Heavenly Pride in the history of mankind defeated the realm realm at the age of four. A story was published, causing an immediate uproar in this world where information was extremely developed. In just a day's time, the news about Luu being ranked fifth in the remarkable Heavens Pride ranking had spread to every corner of the human race.

For a while, no one knew what was going on. No one expected this son of the Marshall Saint, a Heavenly Pride that should have risen to prominence in the future, to have even made an early appearance. He had broken through to the seventh level of the blue star University's trial secret realm, which meant booking a ticket to the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. As long as Lu you was willing, he could directly participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle.

This has generated quite a heated discussion. Some people praised Luu's terrifying and unprecedented talent and believed he was bound to become the second Marshall Saint in the future. Others questioned the possibility of shady practices. After all, the other participants needed to go through the audition rounds, selection rounds, and fight over one after another, eliminating countless opponents in order to qualify for the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle. Luu, on the other hand, had only broken through the seventh level of the secret realm of Trials to qualify. That's not fair to the other players, some people argued, if there was a dark secret in it, it would simply be the greatest insult to the pride of the human race.

Some people also stood out and refuted, saying that blue star University, military Marshall University, and star Marshall University all had similarly reserved spots, so why didn't they go and question the other contestants, but specifically came to question Luu. Could it be that other people don't have to compete, they just get the ticket qualification and have no problem with it, but Luu has a problem with it? Those who stood out and questioned it immediately retorted back, saying that Luu was too young, his cultivation time was too short, and his combat experience was too little, and on top of that, he hadn't mastered the domain yet. The other players who had gotten their tickets in advance were without exception all strong masters of the domain, in addition, they were also very experienced in combat, having practiced for many years and had an extraordinarily solid foundation. As for Luu, his flaws were too obvious, if he was allowed to directly participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle and was eliminated in one round, who would be responsible?

Chapter 158: A Farce

Five embodied Spirit pill Luu had broken through the seventh level of the trial Mystic realm and gotten the qualification to attend the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. This would mean that he squeezed out an alternate character, this unlucky bastard was called Su Dawan, the number one Heavenly pride of Sirius stars five Realms. Along the way, he eliminated countless opponents, breaking through round after round, and could be said to have experienced many hardships and dangers before finally getting the ticket to the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle.

As a result, because of Luu's appearance, the tickets that had arrived suddenly flew away. How can this not be urgent? Su Dawan is not convinced and neither are his fans. It's more than normal to think that there must be something Shady going on here, so it was that Su Dawan and his fans sent out a protest to the officials. As a result, officials simply ignored it. Su Dawan continued to test, wanting to fight Luu. As long as he lost, he was convinced at that time Luu would be able to convince the public when he went out to fight in the 10,000 Clan's Heavenly Pride battle. Su Dou Chuan's idea was a good one, sort of giving the officials a leg up and Luu a chance to prove himself. As long as Luu was confident in his own strength, then he would definitely not refuse, and the officials should also agree to the results. Officials or not, Luu acted as if they hadn't heard his request, simply ignoring it as if to say in a silent voice, "You deserve it, bully." This is too much of a bully, Sud Dawan felt very agreed that the participation spot that should have belonged to him had been snatched away from him by the powers that be just like that. As a result, Su Dawan rallied his fans, and on major websites, various protests were made, which aroused the sympathy of many people. As things get bigger and bigger, officials had no choice but to offer an explanation on the seventh level of blue star University's trial secret realm. The Guardians were domain powerhouses, Luu being able to break through the seventh level meant that he was able to defeat a primary domain possessor with this kind of strength. Any 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle participant would be lucky to have such a strong opponent.

In the selection tournament, there was no doubt that Luu would not be his opponent. There was no controversy over Luu's place in the Heaven Pride battle. If Su Dawan suggested a contest, it would not be necessary. They should weigh themselves first and see if they could beat a domain powerhouse. If Su Dawan was still unconvinced, he could make an exception and allow him to go to Blue Star University and break into the secret realm of TR's. If he could also break through the seventh floor, then he could also qualify for the Heaven Pride battle.

When Su Daan saw this response, he readily agreed and immediately rushed to Blue Star University to break into the secret realm of the trial as a special invite. Unlike other Blue Star University students, his breakthrough was exceptionally high in attention. Before breaking through, Su Daan confidently stated that since Luu could break through the seventh floor, there was no reason why he couldn't. Unfortunately, imagination is beautiful, and reality is bone dry. Not to mention the seventh floor, Su Daan couldn't even break through the sixth floor. After breaking through the sixth floor several times over and over again, he still couldn't break through and was all but slapped out.

Su Dawan was anxious, and his fans were dumbfounded as well. Not why is this sixth floor so difficult? This should be harder than the seventh floor, right? There must be a problem. How can you pass the sixth floor when you said you'd break through the seventh floor? A Blue Star University student came forward and said that when Luu broke through the sixth floor, it was just a sword, and he broke through a complete landslide victory. As for what happened to Su Daan, why can't you even break through this sixth floor? All I can say is practice more. If you're a vegetable, if you can't afford to lose, don't play. How dare you try to touch Luu with that good thing? I didn't waste anyone's time this farce, which made a lot of noise, also allowed countless melon eaters to further understand what great Luu's strength was. In the fifth on the heavens remarkable ranking, it was not a false name but a very accurate ranking. The skepticism on Luu was much smaller as a result, of course. Those skepticisms, they didn't exactly go away. People who like conspiracy theories will question them no matter how much you try to prove yourself.

Blue Star University witnessed this farce with his own eyes and couldn't help but shake his head. This little Luu, after breaking into the secret realm of the trial, he immediately closed down and didn't care about the storm in the outside world. He's really calm and collected now. He's fifth on the heavens remarkable ranking, squeezing me down to sixth. That means it's stronger than me. By Yu Jing blinked a bit, incredulous. This growth in strength is just too fast. Dasha Heroes group, as Luu broke through the seventh level of the trial mysteries and got the qualification for the 10,000 races Heaven Pride battle, the group once again boiled over. Big brother is awesome, big brother did it, big brother is really going to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle. Fifth on the heavens remarks list, it's a pity if we give big brother another half a year; he can definitely rush to number one. There are actually idiots on the internet who dare to question big brother. Brothers and sisters, spray them, yes!

Marshall Saints residence by Yu Ya looked at the latest news in surprise. Not this stupid kid really wants to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle and really let him get the qualification. Broke through the seventh level of the secret realm of Trials by Yu Ya couldn't help but blink her heart filled with shock. The reason was simple. Even after graduating that year, she hadn't broken through the seventh floor. On the contrary, it was Lu Chang Xang who had broken through the ninth floor before graduation, causing countless people to gasp in amazement. Now that Luu had only been enrolled in school for a year, he had broken through the seventh floor, which was a bit faster than Li Changing's progress back then. Jia Wanan looked at the information in front of him and couldn't help but furrow his brows. After failing to master the domain, he broke through the seventh floor and qualified for the Heaven Pride battle. This is quite a surprise. However, this strength in the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle can only be considered as a medium level, and it's basically impossible to get a top ranking. Time is too short, though having broken through the seventh level of the secret realm of Trials. But Luu was not the least bit proud. The reason is simple. The guardian of the eighth floor defeated him in just an instant. The fifth level of the domain's guardian is simply incredibly strong. Just a casual point, a flash of cold light stabbed Luu lost consciousness, not even the room to resist. Losing is too dry. The heart, which was still a bit restless, instantly calmed down. Not even being able to break through the eighth floor and still wanting to obtain a top ranking in the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle, was tantamount to a fool's dream. The difference is just too great. Must find a way to catch up, never waste a single moment. After failing to break through the eighth floor, Luu immediately came to the inscription stone monument hall and prepared to enlighten and cultivate here. However, to Luu's surprise, there was someone who had come here early and was waiting for him to come over at the same time. A quest prompt flashed before his eyes. Stage one quest: obtaining the qualification to participate in the 10,000.

The battle of the Heavenly Pride clans has been completed. The mission reward of five infused spiritual Elixirs has been issued. Luu glanced at the quest prompt but didn't examine the effects of the five infused Spirit pills. He raised his head to look at the person in front of him and asked, "You were expecting me? That's right, I came over here to analyze the origin laws of the domain way for you." Chapter 159: L's loss of temperament.

The person who spoke was undoubtedly the lord of the Trials secret realm, the human Marshall ancestor. Luu blinked in surprise and asked, "Is this the gift you want to give me?"

The Marshall ancestor smiled and nodded. "You're about to master the domain, but you haven't fully mastered it yet. I've come to analyze the origin laws of the domain for you. It's just right if you accidentally take the wrong path in the way of The Realm. By the time you react, it will be too late."

Luu asked with curiosity, "How are you going to parse this for me?" One must know that Luu's teacher was a sword Emperor, and his old man was a marshal Saint. With these two great men as teachers, his cultivation conditions were unrivaled. These two never analyzed the domain's origin laws for Luu, so how could the Marshall ancestor do this?

The Marshall ancestor seemed to have seen through Luu's thoughts and couldn't help but roll his eyes as he continued, "But old me, I've lived for at least 4 to 5,000 years. The accumulation of this is not even comparable to that human Marshall Saint kid. Let me test you. How do you think about the nine layers of the battlefield of this trial Mystic realm?"

When Luu heard this, he was slightly stunned and pondered for a moment before opening his mouth and saying, "This secret realm of Trials is perhaps a large-scale domain."

The martial ancestor looked at Luu with some surprise. There were a few points of enlightenment, but Luu was wrong in this answer. "Yes and no," Luu was somewhat unable to understand what the Marshall ancestor meant.

The Marshall ancestor waved his hand, and Luu hurriedly followed. It was only a short distance away when suddenly, his feet stepped out of the air. Luu was shocked to realize that something was wrong, and just as he tried to levitate, his body felt like it had lost control and plunged down.

The Marshall ancestor looked at him with a smile on his face, as if he wanted to see Luu's reaction. When he saw that Luu didn't wince in fear, the Marshall ancestor couldn't help but shake his head and sigh, "Meaningless, uninteresting brat. Too much guts."

Luu looked around, and the scene was marvelous to watch. It was like playing a game and suddenly falling out of the map. Not far away, the secret realm had nine layers of space with nine battlefields on each layer, totaling 81 battlefields. They appeared clearly beneath them.

The Marshall ancestor stood at his side, pointing at the chaotic air currents in the distance. "Interesting, isn't it?"

Luu nodded, it was the first time he had seen the secret realm from this perspective. The Marshall ancestor smiled and said, "That's natural. I'm the first Lord of the human race's Secret Realm, and my mastery of the secret realm is the strongest among all the secret realm Lords."

The Marshall ancestor continued, "To answer your question from before, I say yes and no because the so-called realm is only a rudimentary version of the Secret realm, an incomplete and incomplete form. The ultimate direction of the domain's derivation is the secret realm."

Luu nodded, asking with some curiosity, "You mean that the ultimate direction of the domain's derivation is the secret realm?"

The Marshall ancestor shook his head and said, "L, what's with the talking points again? You see in a hurry again." The Marshall ancestor said with a smile, "Listen to me quietly and I will unfold the story. There are two directions of evolution after the domain. One type is to gradually expand and stabilize, eventually forming a small world. This stage is called the Marshall King realm."

"In earlier times, people called the Marshall King realm the lord of the world. If one further becomes stronger and masters the four types of basic laws: earth, water, fire, and wind, so that the small world gradually possesses vitality from the initial chaos to the beginning of the heavens and earth, from disorder to order and from noo to taii, eventually becoming a small world that truly has living beings. This stage is called Marshall Emperor."

"Earlier people called the Marshall Emperor realm the god of the world."

Luu asked with some curiosity, "What about the Marshall Saint?"

When these words came out, the Marshall ancestor couldn't help but glance at Luu. This little guy was looking for a fight, wasn't he? The Marshall ancestor said without any good humor, "Don't interrupt. We are now talking about the stage evolution of Marshall King and Marshall Emperor. Marshall Saint, wait until you grow up."

Luu blinked and closed his mouth. The Marshall ancestor continued, "Other than that, there is another path: returning greatness to yourself, fusing the realm into the physical body and creating a heaven and earth of its own."

Within one's body, this is the path to becoming an emperor in the physical form. You've comprehended numerous inscriptions, and your physical body and Dharma phase are exceptionally powerful. You can attempt this path. Upon hearing this, Luu subconsciously thought, "After becoming an emperor in the flesh, one should be able to become a Saint in the Flesh as well." The martial ancestor nodded, saying theoretically, it is possible. However, there's only one Marshal Saint in the human community so far, and the path is still being explored. We can't know if it's possible until someone tries.

He then pointed to a distant secret realm and continued, "I will now explain the evolution of this secret realm to you. From tight e to Tao, taer, taiu, and finally Tai Chi, these five stages of derivation are the origin laws of the domain way. How much you can comprehend will depend on yourself." Luu nodded slightly and knelt down to listen attentively to the Marshall ancestor's teachings. The ancestor's 4 to 5 million years of accumulation was still something remarkable. The explanation of the realm's way was an eye-opening experience, moving from shallow to deep and analyzing it layer by layer with various novel perspectives.

In just one day, Luu mastered the true meaning of the domain. However, casting a field still required more practice. Additionally, Luu pondered which path to take: the regular field route or the path of attributing greatness to oneself. These were two diametrically opposed paths, and Luu didn't decide hastily. Instead, he made a direct communication call to his father.

Lu Chan Chang, Luu's father, asked what the problem was. Luu then quickly asked his question about the path he should take. Upon hearing this, Lu Chang Xang glanced at Luu with surprise. Luu had indeed mastered the true meaning of the domain. Lu noted this and briefly told his father about the Marshall ancestor's teachings. Lu Chang Xang responded, "This question is quite simple. Just look at the number of inscriptions you've mastered. If you master a large enough number, you can completely take the path of becoming a Saint in the Flesh. Compared to the domains, this path is purer but also more demanding. By the way, how many inscriptions have you mastered now?"

Luu answered truthfully that he had mastered 921 inscriptions. Lu Chang Xang widened his eyes in astonishment, as this was the first time in a long while that he had been so taken aback. Luu blinked, realizing that his old man's reaction was quite significant. Luu knew that mastering 921 inscriptions was considered quite exceptional. Usually, when people encounter such a situation, they would hide their clumsiness and not show their full strength. However, Luu was different. His father was a martial arts Saint, the most powerful person in the entire human community. In that case, what was there to fear?

Luu showed his strength progress openly, as there was no need to cover it up. Luu's father, Lu Chong Xen, then asked if it was bad to master too many inscriptions. Luu looked up at his father with a naive face. Lu Chong Xen shook his head and smiled, saying that there was nothing wrong with mastering many inscriptions. This inscription thing, the more one mastered, the better. With so many inscriptions mastered, Luu could indeed take the path of becoming an emperor in the flesh. However, to take the path of becoming a Saint in the Flesh, Luu needed to continue comprehending inscriptions. Lu Chong Xen explained that 921 inscriptions were not enough; at least one million inscriptions needed to be mastered. After achieving that, walking this path would become much easier.

Luu understood what he should do next. He went to the Inscription Stone Tablet Hall to continue comprehending the inscriptions. Previously, he had broken through six or seven layers of the trial mysteries consecutively and had 14 more days of enlightenment time inside the Great Hall of Inscribed Stones. As Luu sat cross-legged, viewing a stone tablet, he suddenly remembered something and quickly checked his system panel. The five aphrodisiacs were of rank eighth quality, perfect type, and were consumable. After taking them, they could enhance the... (The rest of the text is missing)

In the secret realm of Trials, many students were lined up. When they saw Luu enter, they were all stunned and subconsciously moved aside from the line. In the entire Blue Star University, there was no one who didn't know about Luu's achievements.
Luu walked straight to the eighth floor, the highest floor he had ever reached. He had a strong determination to break through this floor. The eighth floor was filled with powerful Guardians, and it was said that only those who had reached the Saint realm could pass this floor.
Luu took a deep breath and stepped onto the eighth floor. The moment he set foot on the floor, the Guardians immediately noticed his presence and charged towards him. Luu quickly activated his domain, and the path of fleshly sainthood shone brightly.
The Guardians were astonished by the power of Luu's domain. They had never seen such a powerful domain before. Luu's domain was not only strong but also flexible, allowing him to adapt to different situations.
Luu fought fiercely against the Guardians. With each strike, he could feel the power of his domain growing stronger. The path of fleshly sainthood was becoming more and more solid under his feet.
As the battle continued, Luu's confidence grew. He could feel that he was getting closer and closer to breaking through the eighth floor. The Guardians were becoming more and more desperate, but Luu's domain continued to grow stronger.
Finally, after a long and intense battle, Luu managed to defeat all the Guardians on the eighth floor. He stood at the center of the floor, his domain shining brightly around him. He had finally broken through the eighth floor.
Luu couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. He had never thought that he would be able to break through the eighth floor so quickly. The path of fleshly sainthood had truly opened up for him.
As Luu left the eighth floor, the other students couldn't help but look at him with admiration and envy. They all knew that Luu had just taken a huge step forward in his cultivation.
Luu walked out of the secret realm of Trials, his heart filled with excitement and anticipation. He knew that the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was just around the corner, and he was more than ready to face it head-on.
As Luu walked away, he couldn't help but think about the words his father had once said to him: "After mastering a thousand inscriptions, you'll feel much more relaxed when you walk this path again." Luu smiled to himself. He knew that his father had been right. The path of fleshly sainthood had truly become much easier for him to walk on.
Now, Luu was more determined than ever to continue his journey towards the peak of the Saint realm. He knew that there was still a long way to go, but he was more than ready to face any challenges that came his way. Chapter 161: He won't really be able to break through the eighth floor.

There weren't many who managed to break through to the eighth floor, so there was no need to queue up. They were able to enter directly. The Marshall ancestor glanced at Luu and his eyes lit up before he smiled and said, "You've taken this path after all, right?" Luu nodded slightly and spoke, "During this period, there has been a small improvement. I specifically broke into the eighth floor to verify my growth. Are you sure?" The Marshall ancestor asked, "No, Luu." When these words came out, the students in line subconsciously breathed a sigh of relief. It was scary to listen to the conversation between the Marshall ancestor and Luu. One would think that Luu had only been in seclusion for a month and was able to break through to the eighth floor. Currently, in the entire Blue Star University, none of the students could break through to the eighth floor. Looking at the entire range of the human race, not a single Heavenly Pride could break through to the eighth floor. Even the Marshall Madman of the Military Marshall University had only mastered the fourth level of the domain and it was impossible for him to break through the eighth level of this secret realm of Trials. If Luu had broken through to the eighth floor, wouldn't he have directly topped the human race's Heaven's remarkable ranking, four years old, number one on the Heaven's Pride list? Are you kidding me? Of course, he was now in the fifth place of the Heaven's remarkable ranking, which was already exaggerated enough. Not continuing to make small talk, the Marshall ancestor simply reached out and waved his hand. A door slowly opened in midair. Luu did not hesitate and stepped onto the white Jade wind and Fir wheel, directly drilling into the eighth floor. The clouds, like the sky in the distance, sat a domain keeper. When he saw Luu coming over, he did not exchange pleasantries, not to mention nonsense, and raised his hand to unfold the Domain. The cold wind whistled incessantly, and the snowflakes, frozen into ice particles, accompanied by the blistering wind, flapped everywhere. This field was called Thousand Miles of Ice. Last time, when Luu broke in here, the other party directly unfolded the field, followed by a flash of cold light that stabbed Luu. He almost did not react to it, and a black eye directly lost consciousness. At this moment, the other party still did not talk nonsense and repeated the same trick, raising his hand again. FW, a cold light stabbed. This time, however, Luu was able to see clearly and dodged his opponent's attack by simply tilting his head. The attack did not create much of a commotion when it did not enter the iceberg behind Luu but instead noiselessly ran and appeared as a deep bottomless hole in the eye. Good, you marveled. The cold light was not any special treasure but a piece of broken ice. Such a simple attack had such great power. The doorway of it was really not simple. Seeing Luu dodging this strike, the gatekeeper seemed a bit surprised but still did not say anything, just raising his hand again. In the next second, above the sky, the wind rose in countless ice crystals, rapidly condensing in midair. At a glance, the cold light flickered densely packed, with countless amounts. It's horrifying when this crushed ice hits. How to hide again? Obviously, after just a simple test, the other side moved straight to the real thing. Luu couldn't help but marvel in his heart. The difficulty of this eighth layer was truly extraordinary. No wonder, after so much time had passed, there wasn't a single student from Blue Star University that had broken through to the eighth floor. The difficulty of each layer was straight up. The seventh layer was still domain one, and the eighth layer was directly domain five. Even if the students of Blue Star University were even more demonic and talented, it would be difficult for them to break through this eighth floor. Then again, back then when Old Dad Lu Chang Chang broke through the ninth floor and cleared the entire trial mystery realm at the fifth realm, what kind of spiritedness was he? That's exactly what the saying goes: if you don't practice, you'll see me as a frog in a well looking up at the Moon; if you practice, you will see me like a mayfly looking up at the sky. It's so heartwarming. Many thoughts just flashed by. Luu's eyes glowed without the slightest bit of fear as he raised the long sword in his hand. His body's inscriptions bloomed with a different kind of light, whereas the light of inscriptions used to be a shining, undisguised light. At this moment, Luu was full of introverted, hazy light. Seeing this, the Guardians on the eighth floor were somewhat surprised and couldn't help but open their mouths and muttered to themselves, "The Way of Flesh becoming Emperor. It's been a while since I've seen an opponent like this. Interesting. What fun, let's see whether your flesh body becoming Emperor way is powerful or my Thousand M Ice Seal is powerful." Blue Star University, where is Luu still practicing? No, he's not seen in the Xin Shin Dojo either. Obviously, he was in the Xin Shin Dojo before. Where did he run off to? Principal Fong Guang was a bit strange. There are still two days to go before the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle begins. Doesn't he know that he has to gather earlier? Where did he go at this juncture? I can't even get through to him. Soon, the AI reported Luu's trail. Just a few minutes ago, Luu went to the secret realm of Trials. When Fong Wang heard this, he couldn't but be happy.

At this point in time, the intention is to break through the eighth layer of the secret realm of Trials. That's all we need to know for now. We'll just have to wait and see. Time is a little tight, but for a while, it can wait. It seems that during this month of seclusion, this young fellow, Lu You, has made significant progress. Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken through the eighth floor again. However, the difficulty of this eighth layer is extraordinary; it's incredibly hard to break through. Let's see how he does it. After all, there's a difference between good and bad performance, even if one can't break through.

Casually, Fong Guang pointed on the light screen in front of him, and the image suddenly changed rapidly. On the eighth level of the secret realm of Trials, Lu You's breakthrough immediately appeared on the screen. "Ha!" As a Marshall Emperor, Fong Wang could tell at a glance that something was wrong. He narrowed his eyes and reached out to zoom in on the light screen. Soon, the light screen projection grew larger, and the battle on the eighth floor emerged more clearly. This time, Fong Guang saw it clearly. "This is truly the way of Flesh becoming an Emperor!" Fong Guang's eyes whitened as his heart grew more and more surprised. Even though it had long been known that Lu You had mastered a very large number of inscriptions, leading to the extraordinary strength of his Dharma Phantom, and he was even able to counteract the first level of the domain with the Dharma Phantom realm, he did not expect Lu You to embark on the path of becoming an emperor in the flesh. This meant Lu You had mastered at least 500 inscriptions.

It's a tough and bumpy road, but it's not one that hasn't been traveled. With the huge number of human communities, any Marshal path has been tried by someone. For example, armsmen, martial artists, medicine martial artists, Nemesis martial artists, psychic martial artists, and so on. This way of becoming an emperor in the flesh had likewise been attempted by quite a few people. Only the prerequisites for taking this path are high and require mastery of enough inscriptions. But for the average person, there is an upper limit to the number of inscriptions that can be mastered unless the bloodline was special and gifted. There was a certain chance that once one succeeded in stepping onto this path, the increase in battle power was terrifying. Fong Guang stared dead on the screen and subconsciously held his breath when he saw Lu You hardening himself against the domain attacks and explosively hammering the eighth level Guardian. "He won't really be able to break through the eighth floor, right?"

Here is a rewritten version of the text, maintaining the original meaning while improving the English:

The fleshly body can withstand the domain's crushing attacks - it's too terrifying, and it's still ongoing with intense energy. It's wonderful, but I can't see much, but I feel that Luu seems to have the upper hand. No, he wouldn't realistically be able to break through the eighth floor, would he? This is the eighth level of the Secret Realm of Trials - if he breaks through, wouldn't he be directly ranked number one on the Heaven's Pride list? It's crazy, it's crazy. Has anyone recorded the entire battle? I'm willing to pay a high price to see it.

As the replies below started piling up, Eugi's pair of beautiful eyes turned white. This is what it means to break into the eighth floor and still have the upper hand without a moment's thought, Yujing hastily spent his credits to watch Luu's attempted breakthrough live. The battle was already at a fever pitch, with Luu covered in wounds and blood flowing all over his body - he looked like a blood man, but his eyes remained bright and his Aura and attacks showed no signs of weakening. They were still comparable to those of a god on the other hand, the eighth floor Guardian appeared intact, but his face gradually paled, revealing the domain's obvious advantages and flaws. If the battle couldn't be resolved quickly, the consumption of energy would become terrifying, even the fifth level of the domain would struggle to bear the cost for a long time. In contrast, Luu's way of becoming an emperor in the flesh was a far cry from the average person who walked this path, attributing greatness to himself and the consumption of energy was nothing at all. It seemed that his flesh body had taken on the Emperor's path, which was more powerful than the average person walking this path in both defense and attack. It was clear that he'd just stepped onto the path, and if he were to switch to a domain, it would be equivalent to domain one. However, at this moment, he was pressing down on the fifth level of the domain - it looked a bit chaotic, but he still had the upper hand. Could it be that Luu could really break through the eighth floor? Let's think about it...

By Yu Jing subconsciously held his breath. Someone off to the side looked over curiously, "What are you looking at? What kind of fight is this?" Several people froze when they saw the battle, even the three men who were commercializing and broadcasting each other's skills were captivated. This is the eighth level of the Secret Realm of Trials - by just sweeping the image, Sia recognized it, and he couldn't help but open his mouth, "Who's breaking into the eighth layer? It's him!" Gowon stared at the little guy on the screen and said with some surprise, "I told you, he didn't come back just to wait. So he's breaking into the Secret Realm of Trials!" Dash Wu looked at the image in front of him with a wonderful expression, "Luu's fighting is pure domineering and completely irrational. Let your fears be heavy and all torn apart. He just chases and cuts - this little guy's battle is even more dominating than mine." Wooy looked at the image in front of him and also recognized it, "This is the way of becoming an Emperor in the flesh inside the restroom, several people all looked at the image in front of them with dead eyes, as the battle continues. Soon the battle was nearing its end - Luu's offense gradually appeared to be declining, and the Guardians of the eighth floor had finally found their footing. He raised his hand again, and a blizzard rained down across the entire domain, but all was frozen in time..." 

The few people in the room couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief, thinking that the battle was about to end, and the attempted break-in would be over. "It's going to end, it seems that the break-in has failed. After all, the gap is so big that failure is normal. I'm afraid that his comprehensive strength can't enter the top three of the Heaven's remarkable ranking - almost, but not quite, be able to break through... it's a pity."

It's the only one who feels pity is Euio. Others were clearly fighting to this extent, just a little short of the last point... "Could we have broken through or is it a lost cause? The Secret Realm of Trials, eighth floor, it's over... what a tough cookie!" The Guardian breathed a sigh of relief but knew he'd won, despite the advantage being so huge at the moment. He still didn't drop his guard, his pair of eyes stared deathly at the ice ball and reached out to eliminate Luu completely, but just then, a sudden change occurred. The ice ball shattered, and a flash of sword light violently attacked. In just a split second, the eighth-level Guardian had his head sliced off, and the gatekeeper's work was done.

The chapter 163, Luu's first practical battle, battle of the momentous occasion.

The few people in the lounge all stared in disbelief when they saw the scene in front of them. One by one, they stood up. No way, this can't be right - what's with the sudden reversal? Does that mean he still has a card? This is a last-minute undercard, a battle that could clearly be over at the beginning was dragged out to the very end.

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

It was likely that he was already at a disadvantage due to the sword that erupted at the last moment unexpectedly ending the battle in an instant. In fact, even F Wang, the president of Blue Star University, couldn't remain calm after witnessing the scene. Relative to these students, Fong Guang, a Marshal Emperor, was able to see a glimpse of hope. The Sword's sudden move in the last instant was some kind of secret technique. Could it be a secret technique passed down from the Marshal Saint or the sword Emperor himself? There was only one way to find out - to enter the secret realm of Trials, level 8, the Battle was Over.

The Guardian's severed head spun in mid-air, his expression complicated. At first, he was full of disbelief. How was this possible? Even if this little guy could break free from his frozen state, it was impossible for him to decapitate himself instantly. The Guardian reacted with a heavy huff. He guessed that Luu's sword was his true card: a secret technique that only this little guy could use, which allowed him to kill himself in seconds. But Luu preferred to fight until he thought he was winning, and then only then to accomplish a magnificent Counterattack. It was humiliating.

Luu gasped at the Guardian's power. The Guardians of this level 8 were truly formidable, even after using all his strength, he couldn't help but be eliminated at the last moment. But Luu's bottom card - Sword Da Tonin - saved him. This was a natural ability acquired from the system long ago, which constantly obtained the power of the Dow of the sword from the universe, as well as from the existence of the void, and strengthened himself. However, this ability came with a major flaw: the Sword's rule forces didn't belong to Luu, and forcing them into his body would cause a certain degree of damage to his physical body and spirit.

Earlier, when Luu was breaking into the reincarnation Tower, he didn't dare to use this move, even if the situation was bad, because he knew the consequences would be severe. I'm afraid I'll lose more than I gain if I use it now. But now, on the path of physical sanctification, his flesh body had already been strengthened to a certain extent, and the risk of using this move again was not as great. Even so, caution must be exercised. This was a killing move that hurt the enemy a thousand times and harmed himself 800 times.

The main reason for using this move was to see how well it worked, as well as to verify its effectiveness. Otherwise, in the 10,000 Clans, the Heavens Pride battle, it would be too risky to take the risk of using this move, not knowing how effective it would be or what the consequences would be.

Well, the results were overwhelming. In just an instant, Luu decapitated the head of the level 8 Guardian. However, the cost was not small. There were many Sword Dow rule powers that didn't belong to him, flying around in his body, and a tingling sensation came over in a steady stream.

If he hadn't taken the path of becoming a Saint in the Flesh, he would have been seriously injured, or even on the verge of death. This move was still an extremely treacherous one, but it also had another benefit: it could use the power of those unknown Sword Dow rules to grow rapidly in strength. The system had said that the method was crazy but effective and needed to be tried with caution.

Feeling the power of these Sword Dow rules, Luu's eyes lit up. Unfortunately, this was not the time for enlightenment. There wasn't much time left. Luu raised his head at this moment, after breaking through the level 8, he could go on to the level 9, break in, and check out the scenery on the level 9. Luu naturally knew he was no match for the level 9 keeper, but he still had the courage to try.

Without hesitation, Luu broke into the level 9 floor. Inside the lounge, Sia's eyes were a little complicated as he saw the scene. He hadn't even broken through to the level 8, yet Luu was already seeing the scenery of the level 9 floor. He heard that Luu had broken through the first floor a long time ago, and he was already navigating the scenery of the level 9 floor. Exaggeration! The rate of this progress is just too much. Since the inception of Blue Star University, only a handful of students had broken through the level 8, and even only one had broken through the level 9. Could it be that the second person to break through the level 9 was going to appear now? They say he's a martial arts saint of sorts, so it's really not true at all.

The secret world of Trials, level 9, the gatekeeper glances at Luu, revealing a somewhat surprised expression. "Hello, gatekeeper," Luu said politely. "Please let me see the power of domain 9." The gatekeeper nodded readily and reached out to snap his fingers. Immediately afterward, the surrounding space rapidly transformed.

An ocean of molten rock materialized beneath us, and a wave of intense heat enveloped us. Luu was unsteady and teetered on the brink of falling into the magma. My domain is called the World of Fire, and the gatekeeper smiled and explained, "This is its attack - the ninth level's flame attack. The flames will dance, but be careful."

The Keeper of the Barrier raised his hands, and in an instant, the flames that filled the sky instantly engulfed the entire field. There was no place to hide, no place to run. Whether it was the power of the flames or the stability of the realm, it was not comparable to the Guardians of the eighth level. In the chaotic flames, Luu could not see anything and was eliminated in the blink of an eye. He had failed, and there was no doubt about it. The ninth floor was indeed difficult, and it was not on the same level of difficulty as the eighth level.

Luu couldn't help but lament after his failure. The completion of his domain, as well as its overall structure, had been perfected to such an extent that it was not too much to call it a world in itself. It was not unfair to lose to such an existence if one were to defeat such a character and pass through the entire trial. Mysteries then the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle wouldn't matter at all. Unfortunately, Luu was not even close.

Luu shook his head before he noticed a message from the president of Blue Star University. Several messages and communication calls had been sent. Luu then realized that the crowd participating in the 10,000 Races Heavens Pride battle had already gathered in advance during this period of time. He had been completely engrossed in cultivation and hadn't paid attention to this slight oversight, but it should be in time.

Luu made a communication call to the president of Blue Star University a short while later. The comm's call came through.

"I have finished speaking. Who's in favor? Who's against?" Fong Guang, the principal of Blue Star University, looked at Luu with a somewhat complicated face. As early as a long time ago, he knew that Luu would rise rapidly. At that time, he was even thinking that if Luu were to soar high and progress wildly, he might be able to catch up with the 10,000 Races Heavens Pride battle. The idea was crazy, even he couldn't believe it, but it really did make him guess. Not only was Luu going to participate in the 10,000 Races Heavens Pride battle, but he would also be able to participate in the battle as the human race's Heavens Pride leader. This was something Fong Guang did not expect.

"How does it feel to break through to the ninth floor?" Fong Guang asked. The difficulty of the ninth level is too high, principal," Luu replied, surprised that the principal was paying attention to his breakthrough. He thought that he could keep it quiet and give everyone a surprise.

"Naturally, I know," Fong Guang shook his head and said with emotion. "To be honest, I really didn't expect that you would be able to break through the eighth floor. You really surprised me, but that last sword of yours shouldn't have cost you much, should it?"

Luu was slightly stunned when he heard this. It had to be said that the Marshall Emperor was worthy of being a marshall emperor. His vision was just poisonous, and he had even directly seen through that sword of his and was bound to pay a certain price. Come to think of it, that sword was too powerful. It was rather abnormal not to pay a certain price.

Seeing the surprise on Luu's face, Fong Guang smiled and said, "The power of that sword far exceeds your current strength. It is normal to pay a certain price. Most of the secret arts are like this in the 10,000 Races Heavens Pride battle. Behind you, this move serves as a base killing move. You must use it with caution. You are the Future Hope of the human race. I don't want to cause your future to be destroyed in order to fight for a wisp of civilization's flame. You have the stature of a marshal saint. Your future is unlimited. There's no need to overuse secret techniques. You should understand that."

Luu nodded and said seriously, "I understand. It's good that you understand." Fong Guang smiled and said, "The Gathering time is about to pass. I'll come over to pick you up." Good, Luu answered, and then hung up the communication call. The speed of a marshall emperor was just fast, and in just a moment, Fong Guang appeared not far away.

"Little Marshall Saint, this way," Fong Guang beckoned. Luu was a bit speechless but still walked over, led by Fong Guang. Luu was brought to the Gathering Place of the Top 10 Pride of the human race as soon as they entered. All eyes looked over Luu, and he didn't shy away from the stage and swept over with a glance, sizing up each of the individual race celestials. Woo w from Military Marshall University, Gawan from Star Marshall University, SIA from Blue Star University, and Byuing's gaze lingered on By Yujin's body for a split second - this was Mom's little sister, his own sister-in-law. He then continued to look at the others - Chang Xi, Sun Yen, Gaia Juan, in chopping, and AO Hongan. These five were the Ruthless People who had killed all the way from the sea selection, and a few people were on the older side.

It was evident that they had deliberately suppressed their realms to participate in the 10,000 Clans' Heaven's Pride battle. Unfortunately, even after suppressing his realm and cultivating for many years, he had only grasped the rudimentary form of the domain. The domain, an ability belonging to a great master, was simply difficult to comprehend at the fifth realm. Many fifth realm Celestial Prides, even if they purposely suppressed their realm when they cultivated, would automatically break through, almost like a waterfall. Those who purposely suppressed their realms and came to participate in the Heaven's Pride battle were inferior to the Marshall University's Heavens Pride, who cultivated normally. However, there was a slight gap in terms of hard power, but they were older and more experienced in combat. All of them were not to be underestimated.

"Hello everyone, I've kept you waiting. I'm Luu," Luu smiled and waved his hand in greeting. "It wasn't a long wait," Yu Jing spoke. Luu nodded and then spoke, "On my way here, I heard Principal F say quite a few things about the 10,000 races Heaven's Pride battle. This time, the Heaven's Pride battle will most likely have a group battle. That also means that we have to stick together to get through this."

As soon as these words came out, this group of celestial pride looked at each other in dismay, completely not expecting Luu to say this. As soon as he came up, obviously only four years old, just a little bit older, but like an old leader, the sense of contrast is really a bit strong.

"Of course, I know we're definitely aligned for the sake of the human race. Surely, there will be unity," the crowd nodded their heads as a response to Luu. Hearing this, Luu nodded and continued, "If there is a group battle, then there must be a commander, a leader. Otherwise, even if they are united, there will be times when they will disagree. It's a great taboo for soldiers not to be able to use their strength in one place. So, I'll take this command. I'll be the leader, and you guys just need to listen to me. This way, there won't be times of disagreement, and you'll be able to better ride out the storm together."

"I'm done talking. Who's in favor? Who's against?" Luu said this and looked over one by one. When Luu finished saying these words, the few Heavenly Prides in the room one by one froze, completely not expecting Luu to say this. Some subconsciously looked at Wo Woo Wy before that he was the one with the highest strength among the crowd and the one who was esteemed by the two great Masters. Who would have thought that the moment Luu came over, it would be an incomparably strong seizure of power? Even Fong Wang, who had brought Luu over, did not expect this little guy to be so overbearing. It was really surprising, but that's good. Otherwise, when it comes to group warfare, there will be another disagreement, and that won't be good.

The moment Wu Sia's face was wonderful. He felt the gazes of the bystanders still. He didn't hold back and opened his mouth to ask, "On what grounds? On what grounds should you be the commander based on what?" Hearing this, Luu turned his head to look at Wu Enemy and said indifferently, "On the basis that I'm the strongest one amongst you. If you're not convinced, you can fight me. If you win, then I'll listen to you. If you lose, then behave yourself, Marshall Invincible. Do you dare to fight me?"

When these words came out, Wu instantly furrowed his brows. He knew very well that by saying this, Luu was using himself as a tool to establish authority, breaking through the eth level of the secret realm of Trials meant that Luu's strength was above his own. He had this confidence, but the problem was, since Luu had said so, he still didn't dare to meet the battle, and it would be even more humiliating if he was scared off directly. It's not a good idea to fight this battle. It's not a good idea not to fight, embarrassing to lose, and even more embarrassing to chicken out. For a while, Wu Sia had some regrets. Why did he come up to strike up a conversation on impulse? He clenched his teeth but still spoke, "Fine, then let's have a fight. If you win against me, then I'm willing to push for you to be the captain. If you lose, then you have to support me as well." Luu nodded slightly when he heard this. "You do have some guts, Wu Wy," his eyes flashed as he spoke. "I would like to see how powerful the way of the flesh body becoming Emperor is."

When Fong Guang heard this, he couldn't help but shake his head. "It's really young people. They are just exuberant." He smiled and said, "Good, then let's go and fight in the virtual world. And when you get there, you can let go of your hands and don't have to be concerned about the weight of your blows." When these words came out, the few other Heavenly Prides in the room could not help but be a bit dumbfounded. "It's not it's not even if you don't stop it, Principal Fong. You actually let them go to the virtual world to have a good time. It's really just a hoot to see what's going on."

Chapter 165: Pure Restraint Virtual Worlds Martial Arts Arena. Luu and Wu were present outside the arena. There was also Principal Fong Wang, as well as a group of heavenly Prides watching the battle. Before that, Wu was the strongest one among them. Even Star Marshall University's Goan and Blue Star University Sia had.

Upon Luu's sudden appearance, he had broken through the eighth floor of the Reincarnation Tower, overshadowing Wuu. The impending battle between the two would largely determine the position of the human race's Heavenly Pride captain in the 10,000 races' Heavenly Pride battle. At the moment, it was hard for anyone else to argue about who would win.

The crowd couldn't help but discuss the upcoming fight, wondering who would emerge victorious. Aoh Hongan, who was standing by, knew that Luu and Yujing were related by blood. She believed that Luu would win, having broken through the eighth level of the trial.

"Does Marshall Invincible have a chance?" San asked, looking towards Sia.

"Yes, he does," Summercliff nodded. "Junior Marshall Saint broke through the eighth floor using a special secret technique. Without that underlying technique, it shouldn't be possible to break through. The gap between the two sides isn't particularly large. In this battle, if he doesn't use that secret technique, Crazy Wo still has a real chance of winning."

"What if he uses that secret technique?" Sunen couldn't help but ask.

Gohan shook his head. "There's no suspense then."

Sia suddenly spoke up, "These types of special secret Arts usually come at a certain price, especially those that are more powerful. There are also restrictions on the time and number of times they can be used. That's why I think that in a short period of time, the little Marshall Saint shouldn't be able to utilize that secret technique. In this battle, Marshall Invincible still has a chance."

Gawan nodded in agreement. "If we go by this statement of yours, Marshall Invincible is still hopeful in terms of battle experience. He is definitely better."

"That's right," Giaan nodded. "But how the result really is, we have to know after the fight."

Sia glanced at the duo in the martial arts arena. "My domain is named True Martial Space. Wuu, set up a martial arts stance."

As soon as the battle began, Wuu seemed apprehensive, but as soon as the fight started, he calmed down completely and was even a little excited to jump into action.

"What is the effect?" Luu asked.

"There is no special attack effect, but a pure martial combat increase," Woia spoke. "It's somewhat similar to your Flesh Body becomes Emperor way, but it's not entirely similar."

Wuu set up a martial arts stance, and the domain True Martial Space spread. The surrounding space rapidly transformed, and an androgynous figure appeared on the ground of the martial arts arena. Woia stood on the black figure, and Luu stood on the side of the white figure.

Luu was slightly stunned as he felt the transformation of the space around him. In the next instant, Woia had already bullied his way in and blasted out with his Cannon Fist. Wuky pulled all the stops, both in terms of movement speed and attack strength. The space was vaguely shaking and twisting.

With this punch, the punch had reached its peak, locked on target. There was no avoiding or hiding. Without the slightest hesitation, Luu similarly threw a punch. It was a clash of pure power and strength.

Boom! A simple collision caused the surrounding space to tremble. Woo Woo Siia, who was still calm and collected, couldn't help but change his face drastically. He had never seen such a brutal punch before. The sensation was almost like punching against an asteroid traveling at breakneck speed. A sense of powerlessness set in.

Wu activated the True Marshall domain, and the androgynous figure on the ground slowly rotated, unloading Field Effect. However, with punch after punch coming down, how could he unload without stopping?

At the end of the fight, Wuky's arm was twisted, and his bones were shattered. His entire arm was wasted and drooped down powerlessly. On Luu's side, his tiny fist was unharmed, and it didn't even break the skin.

The crowds in the viewing gallery were all dropped, almost unable to believe their eyes. The little Marshall Saint didn't use his best sword but instead got up close and personal and physically fought with Wuu. Even so, it was still punch after punch smashing Wuu out of the arena. It had only been a short while, and even with his full strength to fight, Wua had still wasted one of his arms. It was important to know that in the True Marshall Space, Wuu's speed and strength were at a disadvantage.

Defense and all other aspects of his attributes had drastically increased, yet the gap remained significant. The crowd debated if Wua had a chance, concluding there was a good one. It turned out to be a close fight. In a short time, Luu didn't even move his sword, instead using close combat that Wua excelled in to defeat him. Fong Wang, on the sidelines, was astonished as Luu's fighting style seemed unlike the Flesh Becomes Emperor way. He pondered if Luu was following the Flesh Becomes Saint way. This possibility left Fong Wang in shock, as the paths differed only by one word but were worlds apart. The Emperor way required mastering 500 inscriptions, while the Saint way demanded mastering at least a thousand. Fang wondered how Luu had achieved this.

In the battle, Luu reminded Marshall Invincible, a domain four, that he was following the Fleshly Body to Sainthood path. Luu initially thought it would be a good fight, but found Wua's approach to be overly simplistic, focusing solely on physical combat. Luu knew this wasn't his usual style, and questioned if Wua had any other moves.

Marshall Invincible was taken aback, as he hadn't realized Luu thought he was following the Flesh Becomes Emperor way. Wooi, however, couldn't provide an answer. Luu then considered if the Flesh Becomes Saint way might be true. The Saint way was only a legend, never witnessed firsthand. Wooi realized he had no chance of winning and conceded defeat.

Luu consoled Wooi, saying he had encountered a more restrained opponent and that losing to him was normal. Luu advised Wooi to learn from this experience and develop other skills. Wooi found this consolation bitter, as Luu hadn't even drawn his sword.

In the viewing gallery, the crowd was shocked as Marshall Maniac admitted defeat. Luu then challenged anyone who doubted his victory to come down and fight. The crowd hesitated, realizing that only someone stronger than Wooi could possibly face Luu. Sia, in the third level of the domain, hesitated as well, not wanting to make a fool of himself. However, as the team captain, Sia supported Luu.

It was challenging even to complete the general tour. Lu You was not in a hurry; he patiently walked around, unlike the others who had the Supreme and Heavy Treasure sets. His need for secret treasures was not as urgent; what he sought were those with special effects. After a while of searching, he did find one. The beads' effect was to influence the opponent's field to some extent, but there was a limit to how many times it could be used. Each use caused irreversible wear and tear on the domain-defining bead itself, and after repeated use, it would lose its effect completely. Additionally, its effect was quite limited, only affecting the field to some extent and not directly nullifying the opponent's field. For everyone else, this was merely a minor treasure, but to Li You, it was a rare and valuable find. The Way of Flesh Body Saint was difficult to achieve a one-hit kill against domain powerhouses. With this domain-defining bead as a distraction, the probability of a one-hit kill would increase significantly. Luu pondered for a moment and pocketed the treasure. He then continued his search, picking out a few more pieces of auxiliary equipment with similar effects to the domain-defining bead. He didn't find anything particularly good, but with these pieces, it was still acceptable. Luu glanced at the time; 40 minutes had passed, and 20 minutes remained. He didn't know the results of the others' treasure hunt and didn't want to bother them at this critical time. He shook his head and continued his treasure hunt, walking around and looking around. At this moment, the Pichy Lu suppression stone in Luu's body suddenly lit up, as if it had sensed something. Luu was slightly stunned. The Pichy Janun stone's effect was simple: it turned misfortune into good fortune and had the effects of calming the house, warding off evil spirits, opening the door to luck, and attracting wealth and treasure. At its core, it could increase the luck of the person who wore it. Following the sensation, he looked up in one direction and saw a bow lying quietly on a mountain of randomly piled treasures. When Luu gazed at the bow, the Pichy luck suppression stone lit up again. That's right, that's it. Luu took the bow down and briefly surveyed it, finding nothing special about it. It was an ordinary straight-draw bow, with no decorations and nothing extraordinary. But on second thought, he felt something was amiss. If it was truly an ordinary bow, how could it be in this secret treasure trove, a treasure that could make the Pichan Yun Stone shimmer with light? This bow definitely wasn't simple. Luu pondered for a moment and tried to pull the bowstring, but the result was that the bowstring didn't even move. Luu, now on the path of Flesh Body Saint, was of infinite strength, and the gift of innate strength from the Dragon and Tiger actually couldn't pull the string of this bow. Unbelievable. Luu didn't think much about it and slightly exerted some force. The bowstring was gradually pulled, and the bow immediately bloomed with bright precious light. At the same time, an invisible arrow gradually emerged, giving off an extraordinary feeling. Even Luu, who had embarked on the path of fleshly sainthood, felt extremely sharp. That's right, sure enough, it's a precious bow. This was no longer an ordinary secret treasure; at the very least, it was a heavy treasure, even among the heavy treasures, an extremely high-quality item. Picking up the pieces, he gradually loosened the bowstring and did not let go at once. The invisible arrow did not shoot out but gradually disappeared, and the bright treasure light of the bow also slowly lost its light and turned into its ordinary appearance. Not far away, Fong Wang was slightly surprised to see the scene. Luu's vision was really good; to be able to find a heavy treasure in this secret treasury was no easy feat. You had to know that the secret treasures here had been screened through multiple rounds, so it was basically impossible for them to be overlooked, even with a good eye. One could only pick out extremely high-grade secret treasures, and it was unlikely that they would exceed this grade. Of course, even so, there were occasionally one or two treasures that managed to escape the heavy screening and make everyone bat their eyes, but here's the thing: everyone else had hit the eyeballs, so why should you be able to pick up the slack? The difficulty of this was self-evident. Luu really found it, and it was awesome. Fong Wang couldn't help but marvel in his heart; it really was worthy of being a little Marshall Saint. The talent was unparalleled, and it was also so strong. Luck, in the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle, maybe there is really hope. Thinking this way, Fong Wang looked at the others. The top 10 tinio list, although they couldn't pick up a big leak like Luu, they all chose superior secret treasures or even extreme secret treasures, which could be considered a great harvest. Not bad. The crowd took advantage of the remaining time to make various fine selections. Luu had already determined the six secret treasures he wanted and returned to Fong Wang's side. Fong Wang asked with a smile, "Aha..."

Luu nodded. "You have a good eye," Fong Wang praised, then handed over a ring. "This is for you."

Luu was slightly stunned. "This is..."

"Inside this spatial ring are various pieces of equipment and items that your father has specially prepared for you to participate in this Heaven's Pride battle," Fong Wang explained. "When he came over earlier, he realized you were in seclusion, so he didn't disturb you and asked me to pass it on to you."

Hearing this, Luu took the ring and instilled his consciousness into it. With a simple sweep, he saw piles of equipment, consumables, and all sorts of treasures inside. Without exception, they were all the very best of the best. To sum it up in one word: impeccable. Luu was somewhat speechless. "This is too much." The joy of having just worked so hard to pick out and acquire a good deal was gone.

After the people had chosen their secret treasures and were fully armed, they boarded the airship and prepared to head to the Secret Realm of Reverse Entropy.

The commotion surrounding the opening of the Secret Realm of Reverse Entropy was far less than that of the Tower of Reincarnation. It was vast, but between the two, there was still a significant disparity. However, the Secret Realm of Reverse Entropy was imbued with a wisp of civilization's fire, causing all the communities in the universe to rush towards it. It was different in nature from the Tower of Reincarnation's screening of geniuses. This 10,000 Races Heaven's Pride battle was a struggle between the major civilized races – a grand struggle on a cosmic scale.

As the crowd embarked on their journey with the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle about to kick off, with all the major communities in the universe, the attention gradually reached its peak. At this juncture, the final installment of the Human Race's Heaven's Pride ranking was finally updated. However, on that Human Race Heaven's Pride ranking, Luu's name had clearly appeared in first place.

All subscribers read this push message. The list was updated, the rankings changed, and the son of the Sage of Wu, the Little Sage of Wu, Luu, ascended to the first place. When the news came out, it instantly set off a huge wave.

Chapter 168: Those Altered Life Paths

Human Heaven's Pride Ranking: First - Luu; Second - Woo Woo; Third - Summer Cliffs.

Those who saw this list were all a bit dumbfounded. What? The Little Martial Saint had reached the top at the last moment? Topping the Heaven's Pride ranking and becoming the leader of the Human Race's Heaven's Pride? This was big news, absolutely great news!

With this Heaven's Pride list, many news media swarmed like sharks smelling blood. The front pages of all the major headlines were without exception filled with news about Luu's ascent to the top. Even the official news of Dashia Heroes of Dashia chat group almost immediately, Yanching sent this message to the group:

"Big Brother has ascended to the top of the Heaven's Pride ranking! Big Brother is so strong!"

After a short period of silence, the chat group exploded.

"*** *** *** *** I roll jpg"

"Big Brother has ascended to the top of the Heaven's Pride ranking! Big Brother is so strong! Too strong! Too strong!"

"This is the number one in the Heaven's Pride ranking! Big Brother deserves to be Big Brother!"

The group was abuzz. Luu's younger siblings were thrilled. Luu topped the Heaven's Pride ranking, and they felt honored as if they had also reached the top spot.

But just then, someone spoke up, "Can't you guys feel it? Big Brother is getting farther and farther away from us."

The moment these words came out, the originally lively chat group instantly quieted down. Everyone froze, staring blankly at the message, not knowing what to post again. For a moment, even Luu's number one dog leg, Yu Guan Ching, couldn't help but fall into silence.

Reason indeed. Ever since he had started cultivating, Luu had risen high. First, he broke through to the ninth floor of the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower, becoming the undisputed number one. Now, he had broken through to the ninth level of the Blue Star Martial Grand Trial Mystic Realm, becoming the leader of the Human Race's Heaven's Pride. The next step was to showcase his skills in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle. But what about them? Originally, Luu's figure could still be seen, but now it was no longer even a shadow. Luu was getting farther and farther away from them.

It was a bad feeling.

A short silence passed before someone posted in the group, "We've got to step up our game. We have to catch up with Big Brother."

The words elicited a response from the crowd. "Exactly! And we have to work hard, desperately hard. We must catch up with Big Brother before we do, never let Big Brother leave us completely behind."

Cultivate, cultivate!

This great Summer Heroes chat group basically consisted of the sons and daughters of Martial Emperors and Martial Kings. They were the top most powerful sons and daughters of the entire universe and usually lived extremely privileged lives. With their fathers and predecessors at the top, there wasn't much of a sense of crisis or motivation that they had to get stronger. Whether studying or cultivating, they all proceeded step by step, completing the tasks explained by their elders and getting by. The elders also urged them from time to time, but things like cultivation ultimately depended on the individual. Even if others urged them, it was difficult to have any effect.

However, at this moment, the hearts of all the people were lit.

Here is a rewritten version of the passage with improved English:

With the flame of determination to become stronger, the idea was simple: catch up with Luu, if not a bit simplistic and ridiculous. Yet, sometimes things are just that simple. And so, with Luu as a model to follow, he gradually changed the original life trajectory of this group of second-generation martial artists. The news of L You topping the Heaven's remarkable ranking spread rapidly, and in a very short period of time, it spread throughout the human community. Many people sighed in awe, holding Luu up as a worthy role model, the little saint of the human race. However, there were also those who couldn't believe it - Luu was only 4 years old! How could he be so strong, directly surpassing a group of human Prides and ranking first? Before this, when Luu was ranked fifth on the Heaven's Pride ranking, there had already been a large number of people questioning the shady practices, saying that it was the result of secret manipulation. At that time, it was a big deal and was only barely ended when the unlucky kid who finally let Liu squeeze out the Heaven's Pride ticket went to break into the Blue Star University secret trial realm and now you're actually doing it again, going straight to number one. No matter how much these people questioned it, the reason is clearly stated - Luu broke through the eighth level of Blue Star University's trial mystery realm, breaking the highest record of students breaking through in the last 100 years. In terms of overall battle power, he was the undisputed number one in the Heaven's Pride ranking, even if the reason is clearly written, there is still a lot of skepticism. Some people firmly believe that Luu's ascent to the top was too sudden, that progress in martial arts has always been steady and steady, where is there anything like Luu? It was like he was on a rocket soaring in a straight line without even a brief pause, even if you're a genius, you can't be like this - it's not scientific. These people firmly believe that Luu will likely suffer a big loss in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle, and then he will clearly realize his problem. However, one learns from one's mistakes, and the loss was a good thing, in that it helped Luu use subsequent growth. There are times when it's too much of a smooth ride, rather than a good one. Voices like these are shared by a number of people, particularly some folk martial artists who didn't think highly of Luu in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle at all. Even if he got the first place in the human race's Heaven's Pride ranking, some people didn't think he had what it took to be a strong contender. As the saying goes, "when things go wrong, they go wrong, question first, then believe." On the contrary, the second and third ranked W maniac and Sia were felt by many to be promising and might have good results - they should be very upset that they were robbed of first place by Luu. Right, surely they would find ways to prove themselves. The outside world is noisy with all kinds of discussions and many speculations. Actually, this is not only true of the human race, other civilized communities are similar. Amidst all sorts of discussions, the time soon arrived at the day when the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle opened. As many people had guessed, the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle was a group battle, this was going to test the team fighting ability of the major ethnic group's Heavenly Pride. After the news was released, many people inevitably worried about the teamwork of the human race's Heaven's Pride Squad. It was important to know who would be put in command, who would be the captain. Luu, the first place winner, was only 4 years old - could the team be convinced by making him captain? Or was it someone else, perhaps Wuf Oria in third place, or Goan in fourth place, or one of those who were older, like Chang XI, Sun Yen, Gia Juan, who had fought bloody battles in the martial arts arena for years and had even gone to war? They were experienced and indeed suitable for command, but could they convince the people? If the hearts and minds of the people were not United, many problems inevitably ensue. In the midst of the crowds, worry, the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle had officially begun, and the live feed was transmitted back to the human race. The commanding officer of the human Heaven's Pride Squad was quite literally little Marshal Saint Louis chapter 169. "One D, to speak, one dared to listen, the live feed," it was a virgin Forest, thick trees hundreds of meters tall, required dozens of people to encircle them in cross-section, Luu stood on a huge rock, and below him were the other nine human race celestials. At the moment, Luu was waving and issuing tasks, while the others listened attentively, nodding their heads from time to time. The image looks extremely comical, it's almost like a child's playground, in comparison to the other groups, the sense of contrast is enormous. Many of the spectators saw the scene, and all of them stared in disbelief. Many people even had two black eyes and a bad feeling came over them.

Talent was almost flawless, but the question was, was it okay to let him command? It had nothing to do with physical strength, as a lapse in decision-making in command would be difficult to correct, even if he was strong in group warfare. Strength was part of the equation, as was cooperation, and more importantly, the command of key decisions. In this regard, Luu lacked experience; it wasn't that he was belittling Luu, but the truth was that he was too small. How could one have good command with too little experience? The pride of the human race surprisingly did not doubt Luu's command in the slightest. This was a dare to say; it was a dare to hear that many viewers were drumming in their hearts during the live broadcast, but they could only barely get a general view and were unable to hear the conversation of Luu's soldiers or learn about their decisions at this moment. Luu could only pray in his heart that no major mistakes would occur, that he wouldn't encounter strong enemies or foreign races, and that he wouldn't be targeted by those foreign races. If he succeeded without any problems, that would be the best outcome. If they all fell at the first hurdle, then I'm afraid that the human race would become a great joke. It was a scene that no one wanted to see, even those who had questioned Luu beforehand. The moment they realized the gravity of the situation, they were praying that they would never fall at the first hurdle. There were also those who knew the inside story, for example, one that won clearly knew the weight of his own disciple and knew that with Luu's ability, commanding these few people was not a problem at all. With Luu's ability, he should be considered one of the best commanders in this batch of Heaven's Pride battle. If anyone underestimated him and tries to take them down, I'm afraid they'll be in for a big loss. The first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle is a group warfare test that lasts 24 hours with the following rules: hunt down a fifth-order beast and gain one point, hunt down a sixth-order beast and gain 50 points, hunt down a seventh-order beast and gain 70 points, hunt down an eighth-order beast and gain 100 points, and advance automatically. Encouragement of the hunting of competitors by gaining 100% of that opponent's points for a successful kill means that if you're killed by your opponent, you're immediately eliminated from the game and lose all points. It's forbidden for any ethnic group to join forces, and if they do, they're immediately disqualified. Furthermore, breakthrough to the sixth realm is prohibited and immediately disqualified. The final team rankings are within one 000000, advancing to the next round, with the current number of participating teams totaling 16 021, totaling 1160 210 participants. All participants can view their team's current ranking at any time. Fight to your hearts' content, and use all means to gain points and rush to a higher ranking. The weak are the strong, and this is the law of Heaven in the Battle of Civilizations. It's either you die or I live. The battle of the 10,000 races for Celestial Pride officially begins this was the information that appeared in front of Luu's eyes before the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle began. The writing was definitely not in the Dasha language, but he knew what it meant by simply looking at it. It had to be said that the competition in this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was really cruel. There were full 16 021 teams, representing 16 021 civilized races, but just in the first round, 15 021 teams had to be eliminated. 16 into one. Such a cruel promotion mechanism even the powerful racial teams, with strong strengths, couldn't take it lightly. If they accidentally rolled over, the fun would be great. Group warfare, of course, could be warmed up, but there is also the possibility of being destroyed. Caution is definitely the order of the day. But it would be a mistake to tie your hands because of this. Luu didn't think much about it and quickly assigned tasks to the crowd before coming to the reverse entropy Mystic ground by airship. He had already roughly understood the abilities and characteristics of the crowd, Woy specializing in close quarters, suitable as an offensive anchor, Summercliff specializing in long-range attacks, suitable for kiting and pulling, Hate specializing in wide-range attacks, and suitable as an output Mainstay, BYU Jing specializing in speed and scouting, making him suitable as a Sentry. The five people, Chang XI, Yen Gaia, Juan, in chopping, and Ao hungan, also had their own strengths and weaknesses. Luu arranged the tasks in an organized manner, and the people listened attentively all feeling that it was reasonable. "Don't say it's kind of like that," indeed. Luu had blown so much before, with his mentorship of the former Chief Marshall, and with his frequent exchanges of war with the chief commander of the Taiway star field, really wasn't just empty words. Something's up. After arranging a series of tasks, the crowd was just about to leave when Liu called them all back. "Wait," when these words came out, the crowd looked over a bit strangely. "What else is going on?" when they had explained the mission. "Are we going to let them cheer each other on?" they saw that Luu took out a dazzling array of treasures, weapons, and consumables from his spatial ring, although you guys have some secret treasures, I think it's far from enough. This item can greatly increase the strength of the physical body, Woo."

This significantly enhances your chakra recovery, extends the range of your attacks, and increases the strength of your damage. Take it, as it also improves precision and delivers instant burst damage, making it ideal for you, Sia and Chang XI. In addition to these Chakra-enhancing treasures, there are also military-standardized weapons for secondary use. Each of you should take one. Furthermore, there are consumables, including six Thor or extreme potions, perfectly suited for your needs. These can greatly boost your strength, attack, defense, speed, and Qi recovery. Each of you should take ten bottles, use them up, and then ask for more. What are you all waiting for? Listen to Luu's string of Arrangements. The crowd's jaws dropped, even Buying had not expected Luu to be so generous. These treasures were not simple; each one was a carefully selected superior item. As for the sixth-order extreme potions, they were even more extremely rare. When Luu made his move, it was ten bottles for each person, and he said he would ask for more when he ran out. That's a lot of money, but it is simply trenchant to be able to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle. None of their backgrounds were simple for the sake of this 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle, the forces behind them had prepared quite a few goodies for them, but compared to what Luu is taking out at the moment, what they have prepared is obviously slightly inferior. It's not about knowing the goods; it's about comparing the goods.

Chapter 170: You guys killed monsters. I'll take the head. Why did you give us these? Wu's words caused the crowd to perk up their ears. Wu's words were also a question, they were curious about it. As the saying goes, you don't get what you don't deserve, and with so many good things, how could they be given to them for nothing? They were not so naive. For this 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle, they had prepared quite a few things, but none of them had ever thought of taking them out and sharing them. But Luu didn't care about that at all. He looked at Wu somewhat strangely and said, "Rightfully, because I'm the captain. Of course, I have to be responsible for you guys. We're a team. Get it, team."

Wuu froze, and a few other people also froze earlier. It was determined that with Luu as the leader, the hearts of the people were more or less lumpy, especially Chang XI's Yen and Giaan. They had once been Wudai Celestials, with clear and pure eyes. Later on, he fought his way through Society, fought in successive bloody battles in the martial arts Arena, and fought desperately in the battlefield for the sake of this Heaven Pride battle. It was even purposely suppressed the realm and cultivated bitterly for more than 10 years before breaking through rounds and rounds of selection to get the qualification to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle. As a result, it was even if their strength was not as good as those few Marshall University Celestial Pride, but even someone like Luu who had only begun cultivation had easily surpassed them. The flavor of it is clear only to them in the eyes of Outsiders, they were also the top 10 Heaven's Pride rankings, but only they knew clearly that there was also a big gap between Heaven's pride and Heaven's Pride, so the disconnect is inevitable and it's not something that can be resolved in a few words.

The matter of recognizing Luu as the captain was even more so. However, though moment feeling Luu's sincerity, one could not help but be moved by it. There is a saying, "Sincerity is always a must." Luu's frankness, bringing out this huge pile of goodies to share, and his tone of voice that was taken for granted left them somewhat speechless. When they thought about Luu's status as the son of the Marshall Saint, it further made them marvel in their hearts. The little Marshall Sage is really worthy of being a little Marshall sage temperament or pattern. It was clearly not in the same class as them, he had already treated the crowd as a team and hadn't even thought about whether they were convinced or not. No need to be polite, these are nothing to me, I have a lot more.

Luu saw the crowd freeze and spoke again once these words came out, the crowd stopped speaking and took the treasures, weapons, and potions that Luu had distributed after the end of the distribution. Suddenly someone said, "Thank you, Captain." Then the others spoke up, "Thank you, Captain." Even Buying said sincerely, "Thank you, Captain." Luu smiled, "You're welcome." As the saying goes, "You are what you eat, you are what you take." When these things were distributed, the unity of the human Race's Heaven's Pride Squad clearly went up a level. Actually, even if Luu didn't do this, he could gradually unite under constant bonding. Let these people see Luu's command, see his true ability, and over time, how can they not be convinced? At the moment, the big handful of so many goodies is actually more far-reaching in its considerations. When this footage was broadcast, most of the human Spectators couldn't see just how many goodies Luu had divided up. A small portion of the audience saw it and couldn't help but marvel at Luu's Master stroke. Some presentable packs were even more impatiently parsed on the internet, wondering how trenchant Luu was.

Actually distributing so many valuable items, overwhelming the rest of Heaven's remarkable Squad into submission, the son of the Marshall Saint truly possesses the most luxurious lifestyle. Only a select few could discern what Luu was genuinely contemplating within his elegant residence. Several Marshal Emperors engaged in casual conversation while observing the broadcast of the heavens Pride battle. Upon witnessing this scene, one individual paused momentarily. This is the pattern of the little Marshall Saint, yet some people fail to comprehend its significance. How does dividing something establish a pattern? Don't you perceive that the individual who spoke at the gathering stated indifferently, "The little Marshall Saint presented these not to appease others but to enable them to continue growing stronger and progress further in the heavens Pride battle." Upon hearing these words, the Marshall Emperor who had posed the question was left dumbfounded. "You're overthinking it. I don't believe it should be so. He's merely a few years old and already comprehends the great Justice of the human race," he remarked with a chuckle.

Luu swiftly drew the bowstring, and an invisible Arrow rapidly materialized before forcefully releasing the bowstring. The invisible Arrow instantaneously burst forth, directly piercing the head of a colossal beast in the distance. The sixth-ranked Beast wailed in agony before collapsing heavily, uprooting countless Sky High trees and producing an exceptionally loud noise. The commotion was so immense that it could be distinctly heard for hundreds of miles around. As he slayed the monster, a prompt flashed before his eyes: "You kill a sixth Thor alien beast and gain 50 points. You have gained a strand of spirit energy which has been automatically transformed into cultivation."

Luu examined the information before him, realizing that eliminating monsters here actually yielded experience points. He could distinctly feel that since this strand of spiritual energy had entered his body, the strength of his physical body, as well as his internal organs, had noticeably improved. Furthermore, his cultivation level had also significantly advanced, and he was on the verge of ascending to the fourth rank.

Meanwhile, in the communication Channel, a miserable scream from Muoi echoed. "What's wrong?" Luu inquired urgently. "I just killed a sixth realm alien Beast, and my cultivation is actually progressing," Muoi replied through clenched teeth, his breath disorganized and cold sweat rising from his forehead. He had nearly failed to stabilize himself and directly ascend to the sixth realm. "Captain, if it's not good, killing the foreign beasts over here can actually increase your cultivation level. I just almost didn't hold back and directly broke through," he exclaimed.

Obviously, the last Heaven Pride battle did not have this rule. Soon, the voices of others resonated over the Kong Channel. Luu instantly understood upon hearing these words. When you kill monsters and gain points, you will also gain cultivation. This increased cultivation was naturally advantageous to Luu, but for others, it was like poison. This was because the rules of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle were explicitly stated: participants would be automatically disqualified after ascending to the sixth realm. For those fifth realm powerhouses who suppressed their realm cultivation, this little automatic increase in cultivation could very well be the last straw that broke the camel's back. The slightest mishap, and you'll ascend and then be expelled from the 10 thousand Clans Heavens Pride battle. However, the only way to obtain points was to eliminate monsters. This was the challenge of this first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle.

But what did this have to do with Luu, a Third Realm refined viscera? Luu blinked and said with a smile, "It's not a big problem. You guys kill the monsters, fight until you're bloodied, and let me collect the head. I'm not afraid of that."

Chapter 171: Upgrade

In a swampy area, several sixth-rank foreign beasts fell one after another. Several Rock God race celestials were glowing with joy and smiles. "Our Rock God Clan's method of combining attacks is awesome. It's 350 points directly to hand. We've ranked straight into the top 100. Haha, it's so easy. This 10,000 Clan's Heavens Pride battle, we must make a name for the Rock God Clan and it's best to rush to the top 10."

However, these few Rock God races Pride hadn't been happy for long. As the experience arrived, each of their faces changed drastically. "No, killing a foreign Beast, obtaining Spirit energy, and automatically transforming into cultivation is bad. I'm going to ascend. The Heavenly Prides that came to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle were basically all Peak fifth realm existences. They could have ascended to the sixth realm at any time but only didn't because of forced suppression. It was like a cup full of water that overflowed right then and there. This strand of spiritual energy was transformed into cultivation. Some of the celestial Pride were still able to hold back because they had only killed a single Fay beast, and there was a limited amount of cultivation that a strand of spiritual energy could be converted into. However, some Celestial Pride who had killed three or four foreign beasts in a row with a single strike by virtue of the method of combining attacks were unable to hold back and straight up ascended on the spot. This was the case with these Rock God Clans Heavenly Pride at the moment. They broke through three in succession and then got kicked out of all of them. The Rock God Clan's Captain, The Rock King, was covered in...

Cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he barely held back from breaking through. When he looked around, his face grew increasingly grim. The battle had only just begun on this first level, and they had already lost three generals, making the odds now seven against ten. If they encountered a squad from another ethnic group, it would be even worse. They couldn't hunt foreign beasts to gain points; the only way was to hunt other squads. However, he feared that the other clans' Heavenly Prides thought the same way.

Situations like the Rock God Clan were not uncommon. In the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle, many Heavenly Prides who controlled domains and reached as high as the fourth or fifth level of domains had been eliminated in the first hurdle. These were the strongest Heavenly Prides of their own clans, who had intended to show off in this battle, but they had collapsed at the first hurdle.

After being eliminated, one of them was so disappointed that they almost collapsed. Meanwhile, the first level of the world realized the difficulty of this level. The 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle was much harder than they had imagined. Killing the hunted F beasts would increase their experience, but they couldn't easily hunt them, or they would be eliminated. When they broke through to the sixth realm, one could only hunt other groups' squads and plunder their points.

According to the rules, if you successfully kill an opponent, you immediately gain 100% of their points. This was a crucial tip. They needed to fight to their heart's content and use all means to gain points and rush to a higher rank. The weak would become the strong, and this was the law of Heaven in the Battle of civilizations. It was a matter of survival, but what if another ethnic group thought the same way?

The opponents didn't have many points to begin with, and it was hard to regroup without gaining a few points. This created a dead end and made the difficulty of this 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle skyrocket. Meanwhile, Louu cracked a smile as nine people worked for him. Louu was the final Cut King, and after eating the experience as strands of spiritual energy entered his body and quickly spread throughout his limbs and bones, he successfully stepped past the peak of the Third Realm and officially entered the fourth realm.

After breaking through to the fourth realm, Louu could feel that he had become stronger. However, being too low in the realm was a flaw that Louu could not overcome. The time he had spent practicing was too short, even with the golden body bead as an energy supplement. If he hadn't taken the path of fleshly sainthood, this gap would have been further widened.

At the moment, it was a great opportunity to upgrade and brush up on his scores. When Louu killed a blooded monster on the human community side, countless spectators looked at the scene and couldn't help but frown in confusion. Why did Louu let him collect the head and give him all the points? Was there any point in doing this?

This level counted group points, and it didn't make sense to have higher individual points. If all the points were concentrated on a certain person and that person was killed by another race, the points lost would be high. What was this about? Could it be that because Louu was the strongest, it was safer to put the points on him alone? Was this part of the tactic? It just felt like this made killing monsters much less efficient, and the rankings wouldn't go up at all.

Almost all of the audience couldn't see the point of doing this. However, some martial emperors and martial kings were pondering when they saw the scene. The pride of the human race would never do anything meaningless. Don't look at Louu's young age, but he is mature. There must be a deeper meaning in doing this.

Thinking about it, there was only one possibility. If you kill a foreign beast, you will gain cultivation because of this. These human Prides didn't dare to lay their hands on the beasts, leaving them all to Louu to solve. Thinking about the key to this, all of these marshal emperors and marshal kings' eyes lit up, and one of them couldn't help but smile. They hadn't expected this, but Chingy Yang gently shook his head and said with emotion, "There's this kind of benefit to having a low little marshal saint realm." The little ch pin Yun on the side heard this.

Despite his confusion, he listened intently as his father spoke. "Dad, what are you talking about? What benefits? How come I don't know?" Shin Yun looked up and asked, "Don't you find it strange that others disabled the F beasts and then waited for Little Marshal Saint to harvest them?" Shin Yong inquired, "Is there a deeper meaning to this?" Shin Yun Li wasn't slow to react, "Yes, if I guessed correctly, killing these monsters will increase our cultivation." Shen Yong explained, "This is nothing short of poison for other Heavenly Prides, but for Little Marshal Saints, they are willing to do it." They were in the first level of the 10,000 races Heavenly Pride battle, and their human race had a significant advantage.

As time passed slowly, an hour went by in the blink of an eye. There were still 23 hours left until the end of the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle. The nine human celestials continuously hunted foreign beasts, disabled them, and then waited for Luu to come and harvest them. During this time, there were instances where the beasts disguised their serious injuries and managed to escape when they were unprepared. The sixth-order alien beasts, which already possessed some intelligence, could make various responses, and escaping by faking death wasn't considered strange.

However, when the images were relayed back to the human community, almost all the spectators of all races found it heartbreaking. They questioned, "Why do we have to wait for Luu to come and collect the head? That's too weird. Inefficiency is one thing, and these monsters playing dead can easily run away. If this continues, our human race's ranking won't be able to improve." They found this tactic peculiar and wondered who made this decision. It was obvious that it must have been Little Marshal Saint, the commander and captain.

Some guessed that the human race's Heavenly Pride intentions were not simple, but they were in the minority without substantial evidence. Luu didn't realize how anxious and eager the human race's audience was. All he knew was that by continuously hunting foreign beasts, his cultivation was rapidly increasing. In the first hour, he killed 76th rank alien beasts and 185th rank alien beasts, gaining a total of 368 points and ranking 387th overall. Although efficiency slowed down a bit, the rankings kept moving forward steadily. By the fourth hour, Luu had reached first place, and the crowd was tired, so they found a place to rest.

The human community watched the live feed, sighing. Many voices suggested that the human race's Heavenly Pride must have their reasons and to trust them, but pessimism still spread. Some even threatened that if this continued, the human race's pride would be eliminated at the first hurdle. However, just then, the ranking information of the top 100 for the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle was announced to the major clans. The human community's eyes widened in dismay and disbelief as they saw their squad in first place. With such slow efficiency, they were still number one among the 10,000 races.

People realized that there was indeed a deep meaning to the human race's actions. They understood that Little Marshal Saint might be playing around, but the others followed because they represented the human race in the war. The mood of all ethnic groups' audience boiled over, thinking the human race might be eliminated at the first level. In the next second, they saw the human race's Heavenly Pride Squad in first place, and their heads spun. Countless people couldn't believe it. The rollercoaster of emotions left them in awe.

In the eyes of the 10,000 races of the universe, the first to appear was human, albeit temporarily. "Oh darn, human race," someone muttered. "Snipe them. They must be sniped. As long as we destroy the human race, we'll be able to rush to first place as well." Strange how the human race had managed to achieve such a feat on Earth. The ferocious Human Squad had become the center of attention among the 10,000 races in the universe. They had a brilliant idea: take down the humans, and they would be able to rush to first place.
However, the problem was that the world of the first level was just too big. The total area of this battlefield was 100 million square kilometers, almost as much as most of the blue stars' landmass. With 160,210 participants placed in this battlefield, it was not at all conspicuous to try and find the Human Squad in a short period of time.
Luu sat cross-legged, stabilizing his roots. Rapid progress in cultivation was a good thing, but one had to be in complete control to maximize strength. For hours, he had come to the middle of the fourth realm. If he continued hunting, he should be able to break through to the fifth realm. However, in a day's time, from the Third Realm to the fifth realm, placing it before it was almost something that one would not dare to think about.
This was still a treasure trove, but honestly, it took killing so many sixth-rank alien beasts to raise to the middle of the fourth realm. It's not a lot of experience to give the reason is also simple. The first level of the battlefield created by the reverse entropy civilization was not for Luu to upgrade. The purpose was to limit those peaks of the fifth realm, forcing them to run around and hunt other teams. It's just that they didn't expect at all that the human race had appeared with Luu as a bug and for all this extra experience, it could be said to be a come on, a cool meal.
Treating this place as a practicing ground, the Human Race's Heaven's Pride Squad managed to rush to the top of the rankings, not a moment too soon. Luu opened his eyes, and next to him, by Yujing was roasting the meat of a foreign beast. Even without spices, the aroma was tantalizing.
Captain Byuing asked with a smile, "Eat, Luu?" Luu nodded while gulping down the roasted foreign beast meat. "Next, we just need to continue hunting foreign beasts, and we'll be able to securely occupy first place in the rankings."
However, the problem was that after killing the Fay for so long, there should already be a Fay squad on their tail. They had encountered them twice before, and when those foreigners saw them, they were directly scared off. They ran away, but most likely, they would spread the information that they were over here. It's not 100% certain, but it pays to be prepared, and they had to respond a little bit.
Chapter 173: What is he laughing at?
The moment Luu's words came out, the atmosphere, which was still quite relaxed, instantly became somewhat heavy. The crowd couldn't help but furrow their brows. They had to admit that Luu's words made sense. They were now topping the rankings, but that was what made them even more noticeable. Other Fate teams would hunt and kill them to get a large amount of points in and wouldn't have to bear the cost of killing the F beasts.
The lure of this large amount of points was worth any team's desperation. Luu glanced at the crowd's reaction and continued, "Right now, we have three choices. One, find a place to hide with the points we have now. We'll definitely be able to advance to the next round. We just need to wait for the time of the first level to end. Two, go to other places to hunt foreign beasts. In this way, not only are you not spared the risk of sparring, but you can also maintain the first place in the ranking. Three, get ready to meet these alien opponents. Come one to kill one, come two to kill a pair. As long as we kill all the incoming opponents, we will be safe."
Hearing Luu's words, the expressions of the crowd varied. Woo Wooi said almost without thinking, "Meet the battle. Must meet the battle." Gawan and Siaya frowned and thought about it. They felt that it would be quite good to find a place to nest and wait for the time of the first level to end. However, this was really embarrassing to say, and this 10,000 races' Heaven's Pride battle, the entire human race was watching their battle. At this juncture, to find a place to nest for more than 10 hours was not going to be a good way to get yelled at.
Captain Byuing opened his mouth and asked, "What do you think?" The moment these words came out, the others looked at Luu. In the end, it was still up to Luu to decide. Luu deserved a lot of credit for being able to get the number one ranking of the 10,000 races so smoothly.
In the dense jungle, several black shadows flashed past. Their speed was extremely fast.

A twisted, terrifying aura emanated from each of the black Shadows. The leader, with six eyes on his face, quickly observed his surroundings. In moments, he made his judgment: the intelligence was correct; there were indeed traces of human squad activity nearby. There was a slain sixth-rank alien beast over there. Go over and take a look soon. 

The black Shadows stopped by the corpse of the sixth-rank alien beast. The leader took a look and concluded that it had been killed about half an hour ago. This meant the human squad should be nearby. The prey was close, and this was their chance. As long as they killed this human squad, the evil God Clan would be in first place.

Captain Dean of the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride Squad asked, "This human squad, why can they kill foreign beasts with impunity?"

The reason was simple: they brought a realm that hadn't reached the peak of the fifth rank, so naturally, they could hunt the foreign beasts with impunity. Dean, the leader of the evil God races' Heavenly Pride Squad, spoke indifferently. The evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride, who had asked the question, was a bit surprised. It was that simple. Dean grunted coldly and said, "In fact, the human race isn't the only one. Almost all of the top 20 ranked right now are in this situation. Their luck is better, or rather, they gambled right. However, being lucky is only temporary. Being overpowered is the key. Because of this, the top 20 ranked squad becomes the hunting target of all the teams. We must kill this human squad as soon as possible before they go into hiding or are killed by another team."

Then, the movement of a sixth-rank alien beast falling came from the distance. The evil God Clan's Prides raised their heads. "Over there! Here's your chance. Be careful and feel your way through the shadows and kill them all." Dean sneered. "Go with that." The evil God Clan squad directly disappeared into the air.

In the middle of the evil God Clan's Speedy Run, the surroundings changed. In one second, he was in the middle of the jungle, but in the next, he was in a desert. An overwhelming sandstorm swept directly into the air. There was an ambush.

Seeing this scene, Captain Dean of the evil God Clan barely hesitated. His twisted domain instantly opened up, rapidly spreading in all directions. Several others also opened their respective domains to enhance the captain's domain. In just a few moments, Gawan's desert domain was about to be broken open. Above the sky, a huge meteorite suddenly appeared, like a meteor shower, directly smashing towards the ground. This came from Ca's domain attack.

Seeing this horrific image that looked like the end of the world, Dean just laughed coldly. "A small trick, you dare to ambush us with just this trick? Looking for death." The other evil God Clan celestials integrated the power of their domains into the captain's domain. Dean just gently raised his hand, and countless pairs of large, dark, twisted hands like worms rose up from the ground and flew towards the sky. Boom, boom, boom, boom—countless deafening explosions came from all over the place. Whether it was a meteorite or a sandstorm, it looked like they were going to be suppressed by these pairs of big twisted hands.

At this moment, an invisible arrow shot from afar, directly killing a Heavenly Pride of the evil God Clan. It was so fast that Dean didn't even react. He froze for a moment, turned his head to look at his fallen clanmates, and his three pairs of eyes glowed a little red. Rock he roared, and his hands ripped violently. The desert realm was completely torn apart by those pairs of large dark hands. At the same time, the next invisible arrow once again attacked. This time, Dean reacted with a pair of large dark hands that tried to grab the invisible arrow. As a result, he was still an instance lower, and the arrow passed through at extreme speed, killing another evil God Clan Heavenly Pride in just an instant.

Luu pulled two bows in a row and directly shot two evil God Clan celestials. "Despicable cunning humans!" Dean of the evil God Clan shouted angrily. "Is this the only trick you know how to shoot arrows from the dark?"

After tearing apart Gawan's desert domain, Dean's twisted domain completely took over between heaven and earth. Gawan spat out a mouthful of blood, his complexion a little shriveled, and his heart a little surprised. The evil God Clan's Captain was at least at the fifth level of the domain. With the loss of domain sovereignty, Luu, who was hiding in the dark, could no longer conceal his figure. Archery mice, I found you! Dean stared dead on at Luu high above him and said with a cold smile, "I'm going to tear you apart with my own hands." Without the slightest hesitation, Dean instantly attacked and had already pressed in front of Luu. However, the moment he struck out, he suddenly saw the little guy on the opposite side of the room smile and laugh. What was he laughing at?

Chapter 174: I'm all turned on. How can I still be unsteady in my roots? Evil Clan Captain Dean's thoughts were simple. Luu's long-range attacks were so strong, then close combat was bound to be mediocre. The field was under his complete control. As long as the close body press in, then this little guy inevitably can be easily torn apart and can't even run away. However, when he pressed over, he realized that the little guy on the opposite side...

Looking down at him from top to bottom, he was not the least bit flustered and even had a strange smile at the corner of his mouth. "Aha!" In that moment, Dean was a little puzzled. He didn't get it; he didn't understand why he could laugh when it was obvious that this little guy in front of him was about to be torn apart by him. "Is it because you think you shot two, and that's enough? So even if you die, it doesn't matter? Damn little mouse, I'm going to tear your mouth apart and grind you into meatballs and swallow you!" Dean wielded a vicious smile, and behind him, countless large, twisted, dark hands reached out towards Luu in an all-encompassing manner.

Luu watched the scene with a calm expression, without the slightest hesitation. He directly swung his sword. The long sword in his hand was like a stream of fire blossoming into brilliant colors in midair. Paul returned to the ruins. The sword light broke through the Black Knight and the countless large, twisted hands, like pieces of paper, were easily cut off. Dean felt the terror of the sword, and the pupils of his six eyes contracted violently. He finally realized why the little guy was smiling just now. He was laughing at his own ignorance, laughing at the fact that he had taken it upon himself to deliver a death sentence in a moment of life and death.

Dean's reaction was quick as he desperately mobilized the power of the Twisted domain.  Pairs of large, dark hands, as if they were waves going forward and backward, kept pouncing towards the deadly sword light, just to stop the aftermath of the sword. Even so, when the sword light struck, half of Dean's body was still cut open. Blood splattered, and his breath weakened. "What a strong sword!" Dean's heart jumped, and for a moment, he could hardly believe it. "I'm at the fifth level of the domain, and I was almost cut down by a sword!" His sliced body quickly gushed out flesh and blood, and in just the blink of an eye, it was glued together and restored as before. The dismal face proved, however, that it was not without cost. "You actually managed to block one of my swords," Luu looked down at the Evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride in front of him and said indifferently. "Not bad, you deserve to be proud of yourself."

"Who are you?" Dean always felt that this little guy in front of him looked a bit familiar. "How come I haven't heard that the human race has such a number one character like you? Whether it's in melee combat or at long range, it's all so powerful. Wait, it's you!" At this time, Dean, who was an afterthought, finally reacted. His eyes widened, and his face was filled with disbelief. "You are the son of the human Marshall Saint Lou you, but the question is how is this possible? How long has it been, and you already have this kind of strength? Obviously, it was only last year that Luu had made a name for himself in the Second Realm Reincarnation Tower, and this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was the battlefield of the Five Realms Heavens Pride. Luu couldn't possibly catch up even if he grew faster. Dharma body, Dharma phase, and domain, each level took a long time to comprehend. A short year is simply not enough, even if one is a genius. This is simply not reasonable. Even if one was blessed by the great Evil God, there was no such growth rate."

Due to the special nature of the Reverse Entropy Mystic Realm, Luu couldn't understand the language of the Evil God race, but he was able to know what it meant. "What a lot of crap," Luu said indifferently. Then, without the slightest hesitation, he swung his sword and chopped again. Jolie Shen Chang sword immediately bloomed with brilliant sword light. The terrifying might once again erupted as the mysterious runic pattern engraved on the sword body bloomed with a faint light. The speed of his sword was obviously faster by a large margin, and in just a moment, there were two swords chopping out. Pull sword prison, pull returned to the ruins. Dean knew the power of the sword and, without the slightest hesitation, dodged and was about to blend into the darkness. "Incompetent, let's pull out first!"

As a result, Dean, who was attempting to escape, was slowed down by the sword prison blocking his movements. It was this half a beat slower that allowed the roiling sword light to catch up. "Poof, poof, poof!" It was like a raging storm under the light of the sword. The Evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride of the fifth level of the domain was directly sliced into pieces and then even turned into flesh and mud, dead and unable to die again without a single possibility of revival. Luu looked down below. Wua and the others had already entered the arena and were fighting fiercely with those few Evil God Clan Celestial Pride. At first, with the advantage in terms of domains, these Evil God race celestials still had the upper hand, but as the Evil God Clan's Captain was killed and the Twisted domain dissipated, the Evil God Clan's celestials realized what had happened, and their faces were that of wonder. "The captain had been killed, killed in a split second! How is that possible?" Advantage or morale, it's simply dissipated. The situation is completely reversed. "Beautiful, good kill!" Wua couldn't help but let out a sigh of admiration when he saw the battle on Luu's side. During the entanglement, Luu had clearly become stronger again after breaking through to the fourth realm. Previously, when he had broken through the eighth layer of the Trial Mystic, he had been in an incomparable mess.

Here is the improved text:

It was only at the last moment that he resorted to a secret method, barely managing to break through to the ninth layer, and now he faced the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride at the fifth level of the domain. He was given just three swords to defeat him, though there was a side to this that had presented its own set of circumstances. However, it was an undeniable fact that three swords had killed the fifth level of the domain Heavenly Pride's Captain. The millions of viewers at the Blue Star Central Plaza were left boiling over when they saw the scene, and the Earth-shattering cheers reached their peak in an instant. These three swords were hailed as an incredible morale-booster, and for one moment, all anyone could muster was a single word: "Awesome." The sovereignty of the domain had been occupied by the evil God Clan's Pride, and the situation had become critical. The evil God race Captain's attack and killing of Luu had already caused the hearts of the audience of all the races to be raised to their throats, already having some people reach their limits. They couldn't bear to watch, and they cocked their heads, closing their eyes. However, the expected image didn't materialize. Luu resolved the crisis with just a single sword, and with just three swords, he had killed the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride Captain. The situation was reversed, and those who had been unable to watch suddenly looked over, taken aback by what had happened. What followed was the realization of what had occurred. At this moment, everyone's heart was pounding. The hatred between the human race and the evil God race had long been a standing issue, and decapitating these evil God race 'scumbags' felt almost too good to be true. Some folk martial artists were even more wide-eyed at the moment, staring at the huge curtain of light, disbelieving. This was the little Marshall Saint, Luu, who had decapitated the evil God Clan's Captain, who was at least at the fourth or fifth level of the domain. Just how did he do it? How did he practice? The questions before those who had doubted Luu's Ascension to the top of the human race's Heaven's ranking now turned on its head. These people believed that progress in the martial arts had always been steady and consistent; there was nothing like Luu's rapid progress. Li was with such rapid progress; the foundation was definitely unstable and would most likely suffer a big loss in the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle. However, at this moment, Luu's three swords had silenced all the voices of doubt. The issue "I'm unrooted" turned off all of a sudden, and chapter 175 went from a contentious topic to a joke. "Are you the evil God race or am I the evil God race?" everyone wondered as Blue Star University students watched Luu's three swords kill the evil God Race's Heavenly Pride Captain. Their jaws dropped, and they gasped out in awe. Even professors and teachers were stunned by the scene before them. This was Zuo Yuan, an old Professor, who was equally impressed. He had been paying attention to Luu and knew the latter was progressing at a rapid rate. However, the evil God Clan's Captain's level was at least at the fifth level, and three swords resulted in a decapitation, it was simply too much. 

This would mean that the current Luu would be able to pass the eighth level of the trial Mystic realm with three swords. 

So, what contributed to this scene? 

One factor was that the evil God Clan's Captain was too gullible, thinking Luu was not good at melee combat and rushed straight over to his death. 

Secondly, Luu had consumed a significant amount of extreme potions, increasing his attributes in all aspects substantially. 

Thirdly, Luu's equipment in this trial domain held a significant amount of "Beat effects" that the other party couldn't truly contest. He even possessed a supreme treasure with heavy treasures but also extremely high battle power. 

The fourth factor was that Luu had just breakthrough to the fourth realm and had also passed the middle of the fourth realm, enhancing his strength considerably. 

A combination of these factors led to this scene. 

If the evil God Clan's Captain had been more cautious, the battle wouldn't have ended so simply. 

However, it was too late for the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride Captain, and even if he regretted it with his death, the Twisted domain was like a bubble that burst up and exploded instantly. 

A group of evil God Clan celestials showed horror on their faces. "Captain Dean is dead. How is this possible?" 

These evil God race celestials were all stunned and subconsciously swallowed their saliva. They knew better than anyone that Captain Dean was powerful, at the fifth level of the domain, he could be said to be the champion of the entire evil God community, and as a result, just for a short while, he was killed by this little human fellow. 

It was faster than they had anticipated, and they didn't even know what had happened before the captain had fallen from the start to finish in less than even a second. 

Siyagawan and the others were also all startled in the last second. 

The sovereignty of the domain was lost, the Twisted domain took over the entire area between Heaven and Earth, the five-fold domain suffocating them for a while.

In the next second, the evil God Clan's Captain had been chopped, and the domain was like a bubble bursting instantly. The situation was directly reversed, and the body of the evil God Clan's Captain fell from the heights.

His face filled with disbelief as he witnessed Domain F's evil God Clan Captain being killed in such a manner. The evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride, still fighting at this moment, had no intention of fighting and began to turn around, almost without thinking, and ran away. The captain of the fifth level Domain had died on the spot, and there was only one outcome if they continued to fight: all of them would be dead, and that was all.

As the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride scattered in all directions without hesitation, Wu wu directly opened his domain, shouting excitedly, "Who's trying to escape? Leave them all here!" Luu hadn't made any gains in this fight, but his site had already killed three of them. This was not good; Wu waxy needed to capture those evil God race celestials who were blocked by his domain. The celestial blockage did not hesitate for a second and immediately released their domains, attempting to tear open an opening and run out. The field they created was unloaded by the huge e and young fish on the ground, making it impossible to tear open an opening in a short period of time.

At least the fourth level of the domain had to be killed first. Several evil God R Celestial Pride turned their heads, staring at Wu in awe. Wu said with a big smile, "Instead of striking, be careful." Cliff exclaimed, "Even if Wu is at the fourth level of the domain, he's in dire straights. Stop them from joining forces!" Gawan understood, and Shangi, S Yen, Gaia, Juan, and the others immediately responded that they wouldn't stand by and watch Wu fall into the clutches of the evil God R Celestials. Woo glared, "I'm not going to let you steal my prey! It's all mine!"

When the others heard this, they were momentarily speechless. There was only one wrong name and no wrong nickname, making Woo's declaration an impossibility to take seriously. The crowd reacted with a mixture of awe and concern, unsure of what to do next. Suddenly, the two sides were entangled in a desperate struggle. The evil God Clans' Heavenly Pride, led by Gotham, realized that they wouldn't be able to escape if they couldn't kill Wu Wooo in a short period of time. Gotham made a decision in that instant, "I'll blow up the field; you guys escape. Blow up when...!"

Several other evil God R-celestials heard this and instantly understood what he was going to do. They would blow himself up, inflicting a violent explosion that would create an opening for escape, regardless of how powerful Wu's domain was. Even if Wu's domain was as powerful as it was, it would be blown open. Gotham called out, "Yes!" Several other evil God R-celestials responded but just as Gotham was about to ignite his domain's power, he was suddenly targeted by an invisible arrow shot from high above. The arrow condensed directly, targeting the evil God race. The reason was simple: this guy was standing still, meaning he must be dead first.

Luu let go of his hand, and the bow string fell back. Invisible arrows scurried out on the ground. Meanwhile, Gotham was about to explode himself, but he had a numbness in his scalp and violently retreated backward. However, the speed of the arrow was too fast, and the moment he reacted was too late. The arrow pinned him down, leaving him dead. Gotham's eyes went black, and he gradually lost consciousness. The other evil God R-celestials, witnessing this scene, were scared out of their wits. The guy who killed the captain strikes again!

Earlier, Captain Dean had seen Wu keep releasing cold arrows and thought that he must not be good at melee combat, only to be easily countered when he pressed forward. This guy was obviously horrible in melee, but he kept putting out cold arrows from afar. He was a "fisherman" and a "muscle," a true "snipe" in the saying among the human race. Carlos, the captain of the Purple Jade Clan, spoke up as he ran, his body a gemstone-like crystal clear and stunningly beautiful.

"A sissy like you," Carlos said, "is that what you mean, silly teenager?" The young girl from the Violet Jade Clan subconsciously asked. "I mean that the human race and the evil God races fought to the death, and both sides lost; that's why we happened to go over and reap the spoils," Carlos explained.

"Yes, this is why Sister Sama deliberately sent that news to the evil God Clan chapter 176: kill or resist," Carlos continued. Sister Sama nodded and smiled, saying, "That's not the reason why we happened to bring a low realm over and surge our points ranking to first place. It's just that we were very lucky for a moment." Carlos continued, "But it's basically a fleeting thing; you can't keep your ranking that high."

This text has been improved with enhanced sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar while maintaining the original story and its meaning.

The current standings indicate a relentless pursuit, a siege that continues. The battlefield for this initial level is so expansive that it's challenging for various teams to cross paths. If they had, the situation would likely have become chaotic by now. Fortunately, we encountered a human squad, and we must seize this opportunity while the field hasn't been withdrawn yet, as it appears the fight is still ongoing. The situation doesn't seem lopsided, which increases our hopes for the future.

Upon hearing this, the Violet Jade Clan celestials expressed a bit of excitement. They were aware that this journey was risky, and if neither side lost, both would be embarrassed. However, if the points of the human race or the evil God race were to become theirs after both sides lost, they were willing to take the risk due to the significant benefits at stake.

Suddenly, Carlos realized something and spoke urgently, "Hurry over! Don't let them escape!" The Violet Jade Clan celestials responded and rushed into the field. To their surprise, the field completely disappeared, leaving only the corpses of the evil God race and no corpses of the human race. It was a one-sided battle.

Seeing this scene, Carlos froze, muttering incredulously, "How is that possible?" At the same time, Luu and the others had identified this group of crystal-clear purple jade race celestials. The gazes of the two sides locked, and a group of purple jade Clan celestials instantly panicked, realizing they were outmatched in terms of power. They were thinking about using snipers, but only if both sides were defeated would they have any chance at all.

However, the expected situation did not occur. Carlos immediately revealed a fawning smile, "Human races celestials, we are here to aid you. Is the battle already over?" Luu asked, "Yes, we are the Violet Jade race, and our relationship with the Violet Jade race is quite good." Carlos smiled and said, "That's why I thought of coming over to join the war and help you fight against the evil God race together."

Luu laughed, "You're lying to children, they are the ones you lured in, right?" Carlos denied it, "Absolutely not. You are mistaken. We didn't mean any harm. That group of evil God race has nothing to do with us. Moreover, we haven't killed many alien beasts, and our points are pitifully low, so it's not even worth waging a battle. I can light up our points ranking to prove it."

Saying so, Carlos immediately lit up the purple jade Clans points ranking: ethnic group Squad - Violet Jade, current points: 3, team rank: 15,981, with a total of 16,021 teams in the ability to rank 15,981. This team of purple jade Clan was considered talented, giving people the feeling that it was like a stone in a pit, smelly and hard, even if it was a smooth thing to exterminate them, there was no gain at all, and they were still too lazy to do it. That point gain was not enough for energy consumption, perhaps it was the lighting up of the points and rankings that prevented the evil God Clan from destroying them and passing.

Luu felt a little amused, "We don't have any threats, and we don't want to bring any trouble." Carlos observed Luu's face and asked cautiously, "Since your battle is over, can we leave?" Luu said with a smile, "I think you misunderstand. I'm just trying to make it clear that we have no value." Carlos said, "Without moving, you guys are indeed worthless." Luu nodded, then slowly descended, looking down at this team of violet Jade race celestials.

"Since you harbor malice and bring trouble, where is the reason to let you go?" Luu's face changed slightly, she dared to conclude that Luu didn't have any evidence, so she denied it once again, "That's just your speculation. I'll repeat it once more, the evil God Race is coming over has nothing to do with us. It's absolutely true. You can kill us, but you can't wrong us."

Carlos raised his head and bit his lip, his eyes slightly red as he looked at Luu with an aggrieved expression, then glanced at the other race Celestial Pride with the look of a man who could be killed but not humiliated. This chuchu's absolute Beauty even when Wu saw it, he was somewhat moved by it. What she said, maybe it's true. Wu couldn't help but think, "They don't have any points anyway, so there's no need to leave them behind, right?" However, despite thinking like this, neither Wu nor Siaya nor Goan opened their mouths to speak, but they were waiting for Luu's decision. Bayu Jing didn't say anything either, although her intuition told her that this guy in front of her was mostly lying, but the problem was that they really didn't have any value, and even if they spent the effort to kill them all, they wouldn't have any benefits, so it would be better to let them all get away. They were waiting for Luu's decision.

The hell out of the way, Chang XI, Sun Yen, Xia Juan, and the others were even more cold-eyed. They had seen a lot and were not confused by the superficial appearance of Carlos. Seeing that no one spoke for themselves, Carlos once again looked at Luu and couldn't help but be a little surprised in his heart. This little guy from the human race actually has so much authority; it's really incredible. Just then, Luu nodded and said, "You have a point. It may be that I have wronged you guys." When these words came out, Woo Sya and Gawan didn't feel anything, yet Chang XI, Sun Yen, Xia Juan, and the others then felt that the captain was still young and easy to be fooled off to actually believe this nonsense of hers. However, since this was the captain's decision, they didn't say anything.

When Luu said this, Carlos let out a sigh of relief. "So we can go?" she asked. Luu looked at her somewhat strangely. "Who told you to leave?" Hauh, Carlos froze, his face going rigid. "You're going back on your word. Going out on a limb, didn't you just say it's possible to kill you all but not to wrongfully accuse you?" Luu said in a somewhat strange manner. "So the matter of wrongfully accusing or not wrongfully accusing is out of the question right now. I simply want to kill you all. Any more questions?" He raised the long sword in his hand and asked indifferently, "Are you guys going to lead your necks to be killed or do you intend to resist a little?"

Chapter 177: Broken Lead. The moment these words came out, Carlos or the other purple jade race celestials all froze, even Wooi Sya, Goan, by Youu Jing, and the others froze for a moment. They thought that Luu meant to spare the group when he said that, after all, they have no value; it's normal to let it go. Who knew that Luu didn't follow the rules at all? Chang XI, Sun Yen, Gaia Juan, a few old birds on the other hand, could not help but laugh. "Good, that's what I'm talking about. That's how it's going to be. It's better to kill the wrong person than to let them go." Although it was true that there was no evidence that could prove that it was them who had attracted the evil God Clan's Heavenly Pride, the problem was at this juncture they rushed over here, and even if they set assistance on their lips, their true thoughts were definitely to take advantage of the fire. Since this was the case, killing directly was definitely not an injustice. It's written in the rules; it's forbidden for any ethnic group to join forces, and once they do, they are immediately disqualified from the competition. So the words of this captain of the purple jade Clan are good to hear. What she's really trying to get across is that they have no value, and there's no point in killing them. However, Luu's attitude was even clearer. "No value, there is no value to kill, even if there is no value."

At this moment, Carlos couldn't help but curse out as he was stunned. "Crazy, you human race, you really are all a bunch of warlike lunatics. Run, run from all directions." Luu saw this scene and said meaningfully, "Run. You didn't run in the beginning, but you're only thinking of running now." Actually, since the beginning, Luu had no intention of letting this group of foreigners go. As the saying goes, if it's not my kind, its heart will be different. Not to mention on this battlefield of the 10,000 Clans' Heavens Pride battle, the reason why he had been talking to this captain of the purple jade clan for so long was not to abuse the weak rather, they are simply stalling. Having just finished the battle with those evil God race celestials, although he was still in full condition, the others were in average condition; therefore, it could be said to be very crucial to delay for a little while, allowing the sixth-order extreme potion to quickly restore the physical strength of the crowd. Don't look at just this moment of conversation; under the effect of the sixth-order extreme potion, the people's chi and energy had already recovered most of it, and they once again had the power to fight.

This time, it was only afterward that Carlos, the captain of that Violet Jade Clan, realized this. She felt a little stifled. Both clearly lit up the points leaderboard, something that couldn't be faked, and the points of the purple jade Clan were indeed only that. However, this group of human Celestial Pride was still unwilling to let them go. "If I had known this, where would I have been so condescending and sycophantic for so long? Should have run away at the first opportunity." Only it was obviously too late to regret it now, with the pursuit all the way. These purple jade Clans' Heavenly Pride were barely able to put up any resistance, even the struggles of that Violet Jade Clan's Captain still failed to make any waves. The situation is completely lopsided, obviously in terms of strength alone. The Violet Jade Clan Squad and the evil God Clan Squad were far from each other. To know Lou, you, and the others designing ambushes, taking medicines in advance, waiting for the enemy prepared to fight unprepared, only in a short period of time to gain a little bit of an advantage, shooting two evil God race Celestial Pride, but even so, it was still a stalemate, and even the sovereignty of the domain was completely lost. The situation, in fact, was already very dangerous. If the evil God Clan Captain hadn't found death and rushed over to kill Luu, then the outcome of this battle would have been uncertain.

If we could win, it would mostly be a pyrrhic victory - losing several people as the price. But the Purple Jade Clan Squad was different. After the battle against the Evil God race, fighting them again was like beating a vegetable. Few Dash Luu drew his bow like a full moon and, after locking his target, gently released his fingers. The invisible arrow flew out like a shooting star, drawing a beautiful arc in the air and instantly hitting a Purple Jade Clan's Heavenly Pride that was fleeing. The pride of the Purple Jade Clan was struck by the arrow and burst into flames like a delicate gemstone being blown to smithereens, causing people to feel sorry for it.

Human communities, with countless viewers, saw this scene and couldn't help but smack their lips ferociously. It's so vicious. Another alien squad to exterminate - does that count as hurting the friendship between the two clans? Yes, the relationship between our human race and the Purple Jade race is quite good. A good relationship. The 10,000 Clans' Heavenly Pride battle still cares about this.

That's right, we've just finished the battle and they're rushing over. What's the meaning of this? Isn't it obvious enough? Almost got caught by them. Are we going to let them off the hook? Ridiculous. They should be killed. These two biters who took advantage of the fire deserve to die.

I have to say, Little Marshall Saint is really too powerful. Who still dares to say that the human race is Heaven's pride? No one is not worthy of its name. Still dare to stand out and bark to hear it. Since the beginning of the star calendar, the human race has never produced such a powerful Heavenly Pride. Exaggerated? It's not exaggerated. Even a marshal saint wasn't this strong as a child. Right? Don't say really.

At this moment, Luu's strength might not be anything to the top powerhouses. But if you associate it with his age, it's a stretch, especially with his growth rate. A year ago, Luu was only two realms away. Although at that time, he had also broken through to the ninth floor of The Reincarnation Tower, shocking all the races in the universe. But at that time, Luu could only be counted as the topmost and most talented seedling, a super genius who had yet to grow up.

You say he has the stature of a martial arts saint? Then indeed, he has the stature of a martial arts saint. But a genius who hasn't grown up isn't really strong. Who knew? But in just a year's time, ah, Luu had already stepped into the category of the top Heavenly Pride of the fifth realm. One arrow killed the Violet Jade Clan's Heavenly pride, and three swords killed the Evil God Clan's domain's fifth-level powerhouse. It's already sort of grown up.

Blue Star University, when the old professors saw the scene, they couldn't help but softly lament. At this rate of growth, I'm afraid that before long, he'll be able to seal the king. That's right, the professor, the S-side set, approvingly nodded with his natural talent. The rules after the ninth level of the domain should not be difficult to step into. This kind of natural talent is truly amazing. At this rate of growth, in the near future, our human race is bound to produce another marshal saint. If that's the case, our human race will surely rise completely.

But Zuo Yuan shook his head. The idea is wonderful, but the reality is extraordinarily harsh. If it really came to that day, the human race would instead be in great danger. At that time, the attack of the 10,000 races of the universe would inevitably be unprecedentedly fierce. They definitely wouldn't be willing that a second marshal saint would appear in the human race.

With time rapidly passing, in the blink of an eye, there were only the last 4 hours left until the end of the first level of the 10,000 races' Heavenly Pride battle on the leaderboard. As the human race's points continued to increase, it had pulled second place away completely, breaking away with a lead. Chapter 178: A strange change arises. The war of the 10,000 races is coming. First place team: human race points: 10,341. Second place team: Holy Ghost Race points: 3,171. Third place team: Star Gods points: 2,914.

When the Heavenly Prides of the major clans saw this ranking, their eyes turned red. 10,000 points? Are you kidding me? How the hell did they do that? This term's human race is it actually this terrifying? If we can hunt the human race, then we can have this 10,000 points as well. How can I hunt them? This first level of the world is just too big, trying to find them is like finding a needle in the sea. Yeah, they've already rushed to 10,000,000 points. As long as there are no surprises, the first place will definitely be the human race's. They just need to hide. There's still a chance.

I don't think they're hiding. As long as we find this human squad, then there's still a chance. Seeing that the time for the first level was coming to an end, many of the human spectators who stayed up late to watch the match couldn't help but laugh far ahead. This one is so far ahead; there shouldn't be any surprises. Yeah, with little Marshall Saint's strength, as long as he's not surrounded by teams, he'll definitely be fine. Easy peasy. This level is too easy. Yes, we have the little Marshall Saint. The advantage is too great. Steady, all 7,000 points ahead of the second place. Is this still not stable? It may not be stable. A marshal emperor suddenly opened his mouth as he shook his head and said, "The 10,000 races' Heavenly Pride..."

battle has always been fair and never favors any race yes in front because the little Marshall Saint realm is low the human race has the advantage but that may not be the case behind another Marshall Emperor nodded it's hard to speculate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle only hard power is the key if I'm right the test is coming soon I also don't know if the little Marshall Saints the few people will be able to make it through this hurdle just as several martial Emperors had guessed just when all the ethnic viewers felt that the victory was assured and couldn't be more stable the accident came as expected when the rankings are published this first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle has been updated with a new rule in the last 4 hours the first level of the battlefield will shrink from the original 100 m I Square km at an extremely fast rate eventually shrinking to 1,000 square km the final showdown the final Madness is coming please prepare all the squads please stay tuned for the viewers of all the races in the universe when this news came out the human audience who had already planned to pop the champagne early all froze what the map shrinks from 100 million square kilm right down to a th000 are you kidding me this rule isn't it clearly targeting our human race how big is a th000 square kilm with such a high density how Fierce must the fighting be it's over it was almost predictable that once the map was narrowed down the human Squad that ranked first in points would inevitably receive the focused attention of the 10,000 races team that's a temptation of 10 0000 0 points who wouldn't want to take it before that people simply couldn't find the human Squad after all a map of 100 million square kilm is just too big too big this is equivalent to half the land area of the entire Blue Planet luu Squad which was a drop in the ocean was impossible to find however when the map shrinks to 1,000 square kilom it's a very different story how big is one 0000 Square kilm it's just the size of the total area of a small County for tens of thousands of fifth realm powerhouses it was but a matter of minutes before they could turn the ground upside down with this little place the human race team there is no place to hide and it will definitely become the target of the universe's 10,000 race teams with the rule change the first level of the battlefield has taken a sharp turn for the worse the final Madness that's coming the human Community wailed in the universe Spectators from other powerful communities however sheared when they saw this rule yes that's the way it should be that's only fair the sun Clan tyin Clan blood moon Clan chaotic ancient Clan and other powerful Clans their Heavenly Pride's results at this first level could be considered very average because there was no way to hunt the alien beasts plus the map was too big to find other squads for a while resulting in too little Point income not even squeezing into the top 1,000 obviously powerful but nowhere to utilize it only dry eyes when they saw that the human race actually ranked number one was still leading the break they were naturally unconvinced why is it that only the human race is so far ahead just by their luck luckily as the map shrunk in the battle became progressively more intense their chance came name if we hunt the human Squad then we'll be number one the opportunity has finally arrived that's right that's right A Time Of Madness is coming it's really something to look forward to 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle the first level of the battlefield luu and the others looked at the information in front of them wooa and the others their faces gradually became grave no one expected such a turn of events at the last minute when the game was about to end with a few hours left the map is starting to shrink as the map shrinks to the last thousand square kilm at that time it was bound to be a mess the intensity of the battle has increased 10-fold and 100-fold bad SE Cliff couldn't help but speak we've taken too many points and the heaven Pride teams of the 10,000 races of the universe are afraid that each and every one of them is staring at us if they are surrounded wuky knitted his brows his scalp was a little numb he was a martial arts madman but he was not a true madman once they were surrounded by the 10,000 rac's Celestial Pride none of them could survive the situation is indeed Troublesome but perhaps not that bad luu shook his head and spoke it's written on the rules of the opening game it's forbidden for any race to join forces and once they do they are immediately disqualified since that's the case the Heavenly pride of those Clans are bound to throw in the towel and are unlikely to really join forces to surround them the rules are fair treat them as they are treat us likewise as long as they don't join forces to surround us then we still have a chance so don't worry too much hearing this gaan couldn't help but speak what if they don't join forces to surround them but instead engage in a Wheel battle this is indeed a problem the temptation of 10 000000 points was too strong and teams with a little bit of strength all wanted to come and pick the peach as long as they avoided the rule restriction of joining forces there would surely be team after team of foreigners rushing forward to wheel over to fight

them wheel Wars while not as threatening as teaming up are a big deal as round after round of fighting went on even if luu was strong he would be exhausted alive hearing this luu nodded noncommittally then said in a single sentence then we can only fight kill them until they are cowed kill them until no one dares to covet us anymore chapter 179 are you going to do it one by one or together kill them till they are cow kill them until no one dares to covet us again as soon as these words came out Woo's blood surged at that moment and he couldn't help but exclaim In Praise good then let's battle and kill as long as we don't Siege we still have a chance Sia nodded since they dare to Target us we must give them a taste of their own medicine byuing also spoke up the originally heavy atmosphere became slightly lighter the crowd was no longer overly worried the unity of the human Squad had been pulled full circle with this fight right luu spoke there's one more thing what is it woy asked as he opened his mouth my current realm is the late fourth realm and I'm about to step into the peak of the fourth realm so as long as I continue to brush the monsters next breaking through to the fifth realm shouldn't be a problem luu looked at the crowd and spoke again as long as I break through to the fifth realm my strength will still get stronger so don't worry about the shrinking Circle for now keep hunting the beasts and keep brushing up your score scores the crowd's eyes lit up at those words when he first entered this battlefield luu's realm was still the Third Realm even though luu's body had the treasure golden body Pearl which made up for the energy gap in the realm those energies were not his own after all even if you can have full control there is still a difference afterwards by hunting foreign beasts and obtaining Spirit energy which was continuously converted into cultivation he broke through to the fourth realm and became significantly stronger at the moment it came to the brink of a breakthrough again as long as he breaks through to the fifth realm even if the situation in the dueling circle is bad they are not out of the question After figuring this out the crowd once again began to hunt the foreign beasts as strands of spiritual energy entered his body and continued to be converted into into cultivation luu's realm quickly reached the peak of the fourth realm at this moment he was just a step away from the fifth realm soon luu furrowed his brows still it's not even close unfortunately time is running out I don't know if I'll make it as time passed the map of the first level continued to shrink and during this time the human Squad encountered many alien squads one after another most of these foreign race squads like the purple jade race Squad were of average strength belonging to the bottom level of the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle and only looked at them from afar then immediately fled away not daring to come over and make a scene at all the human race is Heavens Pride Squad even if their strength was average was only compared to other powerful races Heaven Pride squads not just any cat or dog that could touch the porcelain most of the heavens Pride squads of these weak races hadn't even mastered the fledgling forms of their domains many of them have not even perfected their Dharma phases and they are not able to perform the Dharma Heaven and Earth the gap between the two sides was too great completely at a different level they also had the self-awareness to leave from a distance but as the map of the first level got smaller and smaller it was only a matter of time before they encountered the Heavenly Pride squads of powerful races the strength of the heavens Pride squads of these powerful races was generally the same as the evil God race Heavens Pride squads or even a bit stronger they weren't afraid of the human Race's Heavenly Pride Squad and they even had to stare at them early on all thinking of eating the human race Squad and getting the 10 0 00 0 points as they continued to hunt and kill the foreign beasts the human squad's points were still climbing upwards first hour after the draw down human Points 11 2011 second hour after the draw down human points 12 141 third hour after the draw down human points 13 05 when the time for the first level came to the last hour the map of the first level also shrunk to the smallest stage at this time all the foreign beasts all disappeared this first level had completely turned into a battlefield for the prizes of the 10,000 races the ultimate Armageddon it's about to begin the moment the audience of all the races in the universe were all excited it's about to start the final melee where is the human squad over there see over there that's the son of the Marshall Saint little Marshall St louu obviously it's different from when it was in The Reincarnation Tower how long has it been and it already has a strong demeanor however what he's going to face is the Heavenly Pride of the 10,000 races of the universe human communities the countless Spectators all of them were sweating points for the human race a unique class this is an advantage and a disadvantage who wouldn't want to come and get a piece of the Heavenly Pride of the 10,000 Clans in this Armageddon the human race was bound to be targeted this was something that was beyond doubt even by

At this moment, Yuyo was fully focused on the screen, holding her breath subconsciously. This was a true test, and the first level of the final battlefield—the 10,000 Races of the Universe. Almost all the Heaven Pride squads had turned their gazes towards the human race squad. It couldn't be helped; this human Heaven Pride squad was too defying of the heavens. They had 13,005 points, which was more than 10,000 points ahead of the second-place Holy Spirit race team. No one could help but be impressed, but those who knew a little better understood that once this human squad was annihilated and their 13,000 points were secured, they would inevitably replace the human Heaven Pride squad and become the target. Moreover, the rules stated no teaming up, so for a moment, no squad dared to make a move, only staring at them with tacit understanding. The feeling of being stared at by more than 100,000 Heaven Pride squads, more than 100,005 realm powerhouses, was exhilarating. Even Marshal Peerless had his scalp tingling for a moment. Some others even had goosebumps. Luu had never seen such a big scene before. He raised his head and looked around at the densely packed countless Heaven Pride squads. The eyes of these foreign races glittered with greed. Some of the foreign races' Heaven Pride were even more eager to try, already somewhat impatient. Among them were the Lizard Dragon race, the Sun race, the Tinn race, the Chaotic Ancient race, the Blood Moon race, and so on. Without exception, all of them were the top Heaven Pride of powerful races. As for the Holy Spirit race and Star God races, their Heaven Pride had also gotten enough points and were curiously sizing up Luu and his group. This is the human race's Heaven Pride squad. What makes them get 13,000,000 points? Is it just luck? Just brought a low-realm little guy over the line? Almost all gazes were focused on Luu's body. It wasn't because Luu was the son of the Marshal Saint; rather, he was the lowest in the realm. In that case, the vast majority of the points in the human community should be in his possession. Just kill him to get those 13,000,000 points. At this instant, greedy eyes almost condensed into substance. Then, Luu stepped on the White Jade Windfire Wheel, wearing dragon-scale battle armor, the JLY Shin Shing sword on his waist, a heavy treasure suit, and a matching variety of secret treasures. He flew forward for some distance, only to see his hands wrapped around his chest, looking disdainfully at the Cosmic 10,000 Race's Heaven Pride. He fatly opened his mouth and asked, "I am Luu of the human race. Do you all intend to go up one by one or all together?" Chapter 180: Installed a big wave. Luu's words were not very loud, but the penetrating power was very strong. The surrounding densely packed countless foreign races' Heaven Pride all froze after hearing these words. Still on this final battlefield, in the last second, it was still bustling with the pride of the 10,000 races of the universe, all discussing this human squad. In the next second, when Luu said this, it immediately became quiet, and for a moment, a needle could be heard. No one had expected that at this point in time, this little Saint of the human race would still dare to stand out and mock the group. Is he crazy, or are we crazy? Prior to this, the Heaven Pride of the 10,000 races of the universe had already treated the human race squad as prey. Now, Luu was actually treating the 10,000 races' Heaven Pride squad as prey, even getting them together. What an inverted Big Dipper! This statement was made knowing that they couldn't be together if they really went together, as it would violate the rules of the Heaven's Pride battle and result in direct elimination. Naturally, no fool would do that. Not far behind, Jing and the others all gulped a mouthful of saliva when they heard this. Although this was within the plan, the problem was that being focused on by more than 100,000 Heaven Pride, the gaze or might was almost condensed into substance. Their scalps tingled, and their sweaty hairs stood up. The pressure was simply not too great. Luu, on the other hand, was still able to be frank and calm, even reversing the Big Dipper and putting on a big wave. What kind of big heart is that? Even W Wy couldn't help but stare with his eyes wide open and couldn't help but mutter, "Are you a crazy martial artist, or am I a crazy martial artist?" Wooo, he asked himself. He was already crazy enough, but compared to Luu at this moment, he was a small thing. Meanwhile, the countless spectators in the human communities stared in disbelief at this scene. Everyone was worried that the human race was being targeted. Who knows if Luu rushed up alone, it was impossible to hear what he was saying, but the gesture he was trying to convey was obvious enough. This is to challenge the pride of the 10,000 races of the universe, declare war on all. Crazy, it's crazy. The major civilized communities of the universe, all the spectators of all the clans couldn't help but smack their lips when they saw the scene. This little human is crazy. Kill him. What arrogance! He must be killed. Even some of the powerful gods were a bit surprised when they saw the scene. This is the

human Race's little Marshall Saint what an arrogant little fellow sure enough like father like son almost in the same mold as his old man nah a little more arrogant than his old man being so arrogant won't end well within the counter entropy Mysteries an extremely special place haha worthy of being my son Lu chaning couldn't help but laugh out in a very good mood since the 10,000 races covet it it would be better to just declare war on the 10,000 races let's see if they dare to join forces hearing this there was a black robed powerhouse on the side that slowly said which shows in the forest and the wind will destroy it once he said this I'm afraid that those who didn't want to make a move originally will be staring at him Lu Chang xang said in disbelief who let you change the rules of this 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle Midway it would have been within the authority allowed for me to modify the rules the black robed Powerhouse said indifferently I need to maintain overall fairness at all times fairness Lu Chang xang laughed his eyes glowing like fire as he stared at the black robed Powerhouse asking word for word then reverse entropy Envoy what exactly is your constant pursuit of the so-called fairness for or is it simply to show that being behind you a good time when the reverse entropy Envoy heard this he fell silent and stopped speaking Lu changing couldn't help but knit his brows every time he wanted to ask for something substantial he was this tight lipped these old Antiquities from the last reincarnation it was as if they were guarding some secret one by one they very silently refrained from saying anything whether it was The Reincarnation Tower or the reverse entropy mystery realm it was all the same what is their purpose really it was clear that their civilizations had died out their communities had been wiped out and the universe in which they existed had worn out in one reincarnation after another but they were still active in this universe today it's like to wait for something or rather look for something seeing that he really couldn't ask anything LU changing shook his head helplessly and changed the topic which Heavenly Pride do you favor hearing this the reverse entropy Envoy then spoke up the Manifest Destiny of the solar Community the solstice Moon of the tyin clan the hijacking of the blood moon Clan chaos ancient races taisu the yuyuan of the Holy Spirit Community the OS of the star God Community these six great Heavenly Prides are all the champion seeds of this Heaven's Pride battle Lu Chang xang blared where is my son him the reverse entropy Envoy laughed with his current strength it's hard to even enter the top 10 oh don't be unconvinced you son the talent is indeed awesome it's no exaggeration to say that in terms of natural Talent alone none of these six Heavenly Prides can be compared to him the reverse entropy onvoy lamented nay the time he has been prac practicing is too short if I'm not mistaken he should have only been practicing for a year or two right Lu changing nodded slightly that's right the reverse entropy Envoy nodded although he walks the path of fleshly body becoming a saint if he converts it into a domain he's only in the first level of the domain which means that he's just stepped into this realm at this realm to be able to kill a domain fifth level is already Heaven defying enough how can you make him fight with a Heavenly pride of a domain seventh level or above not necessarily Lu Chang xang spoke in fact at first I thought similarly to you thinking that it would be hard enough for him to participate in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle but then he changed my mind see this kid always surprises the reverse entropy Envoy didn't deny it but just smiled maybe Dash the ultimate Battlefield luu came up with a big load naturally there was a foreign racist Pride that couldn't stand to watch it's too arrogant to tolerate it's absolutely intolerable at that time some foreign races Heavenly Pride rushed up boom the ground raised 10 0000 M of smoke as a steel giant roared up die for me with a roar the arm which resembled the building smashed straight over luu did not Dodge he just gently raised his hand and blocked this terrifying strike under the huge gap in strength not to mention being smashed away luu didn't even move his body in the slightest then he just squeezed this huge arm and made the steel giant struggle ninth level of Dharma phase you haven't even mastered the domain and you dare to come over here to die luu said with disdain this foreign Race's Heavenly Pride he didn't even have the awareness to be Canon fod a this the pride of the card gang Clan's face changed drastically completely not expecting the strength of this little guy from the human race to be so terrifying he was just about to shed the arm and Break Free the next instant the sword light has arrived the hard and incomparable steel body of the card gang Clan was neatly turned into two halves and the body gradually turned into nothingness directly eliminated out luu raised the long sword in his hand and spoke blandly next chapter 181 again again whom this strength it's not bad to be so arrogant one really does have an arrogant base what a strong physical body to be able to lift so much weight without exerting a Dharma phase it's a little hard to see what kind of strength he has let's have a domain expert test it out who goes the 10,000 races Celestial Pride was talking about

Here is the improved English text while maintaining the original meaning:

Lu's strength was without a doubt incredibly powerful; there were those who could defeat him, but they were few at this moment. Each of these top powerhouses was watching, and not in a hurry to make a move. No one wanted to expose their cards so easily, after all, there was a long way to go before the end of the first level. It was not wise to expose one's strength and tricks in a hurry, especially in the vast cosmic 10,000-race universe. However, in the Heavens Pride Squad, there were still quite a few of the more than 100,000 powerhouses who were overwhelmed by greed. When they heard Lu's words, they rushed over one after another, and even a few Heavenly Prides directly teamed up to kill him. This was not unusual, as they were from the same Squad and were not supposed to join forces with other Squads; they just wanted to kill him together.

Seeing this scene, behind Lu, Wuy, and the others couldn't help but furrow their brows. However, remembering Lu's instructions, they held back and didn't go over to support. They stared earnestly at the battlefield in front of them, ready to strike in support at any time. However, their concerns proved to be overstated, as the sword light kept flashing. The individual foreign Pride, was a top genius in its own tribe, but under Lu's sword, it was like a weed that was easily harvested without even a slight resistance. Poo poopoooo, when a sword went over it, the foreign Pride fell like a leaf. When some of the foreign Pride saw this, they were immediately emboldened and turned around to run, but it was already too late. Lu's sword was too fast and too fierce, and did not give them a chance to escape. It transformed into a merciless harvesting machine. "Weak! Weak, where are the real powerhouses? Why did you let a bunch of cannon fodder come up here to die? Not even a single domain for me!" Lu was a little upset. He could now be said to be at the peak limit and great circle of the fourth Realm, and was about to break through to the fifth Realm. However, it's that close, it's not about experience anymore. Even being able to keep killing monsters doesn't help much. The real world is not a game where you can automatically upgrade when your experience value is at the top realm. Breakthroughs take all aspects into account. At this moment, Lu needed to precipitate, integrate, and then sublimate. If he had more time, he could have successfully broken through to the fifth Realm. After closing his eyes for 10 days and half a month, unfortunately, time was what was most in short supply. That's why he wanted to complete this process of precipitation integration and sublimation through constant battles and smoothly break through to the fifth Realm. Breaking through in the middle of a battle was considered to be an occurrence for human martial artists; Lu hadn't tried it yet, so looking forward to it. Who knew that these topmost foreign tribes, Heavenly Pride, one more cunning than the other, would not come up at all but instead snub those weak tribes, Heavenly Pride, for cannon fodder? The so-called Heavenly Pride of the 10,000-race universe-this is it. 

The moment Lu's words came out, some top powerhouses finally couldn't help themselves. In the Sunclan Heavenly Pride Squad, the absolute Heavenly Pride, Heaven's Destiny, slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were golden and very soul-stirring. Even a simple glance at him could shake the heart and mind. Heaven's Destiny calmly glanced at the Sunclan Heavenly Pride next to him and spoke, "Fly, Floating Light, go and teach him a lesson." As soon as these words came out, the Sum's Heavenly Pride, named Flying Light, immediately revealed an excited smile. "I've been waiting for you to say this. I can't stand to see this human race brat pretending so much without the slightest hesitation." The Flying Light directly pressed over, and a vast domain swept across the entire Heaven and Earth. A great sun rose, and the Sun's race Heavenly Pride, Flying Light, was situated on top of this great Sun. As he opened his hands and said with a smile, "Little fellow of the human race, I've come to meet you." As soon as these words came out, the 10,000-races Heavenly Pride, Canon F, who was originally prepared to pounce over, immediately changed their faces. "Domain fifth! It's him, the second expert of the Sunlan Heaven's Pride Squad! Floating Light, there's a good show. Retreat!" As the Flying Light made his appearance, the top Celestial Pride of the powerful Plan opened their eyes one by one. The Shuu of the Tyn clan, the Hijack of the Blood Moon Clan, the Tysu of the Chaotic Ancient Clan, the Yuyuan of the Holy Spirit Clan, and all the members of the Star God Clan, all looked towards the center of the battlefield with interest. 

This situation allowed Lu to finally test the depths of his domain. As he nodded slightly, "Here comes an okay one, not bad," Flying Light stared at Lu dead in the face. "A mere peak of the fourth Realm, and you dare to be so arrogant! Who do you think I am?" Flying Light raised his hand and dazzling blinding white light spread over the sky. As the level of the domain continues to increase, a number of characteristics were created, for example, the must-hit feature within the field; the density of the attack was directly pulled full. Even if the speed was fast, as long as it was within the field, it was impossible to avoid it.

Here's the text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

Is the case at the moment with the blinding white light? Luu was inevitably attacked, the white light being extremely hot and having a defensive effect. A burning sensation shot through Luu like a steady stream, as he floated towards the light, holding a flaming lance. He had dashed towards Luu's front and stabbed without hesitation, hitting just as Luu suddenly opened his eyes and violently stabbed his sword, Puman sword, with a resounding "Boom!" A sword and gun clashed, and an incredibly terrifying explosion erupted from the strike.

Floating Light only felt numbness in his arms, and the palm of his hand, which held the Lance, was already full of cracks. He exclaimed in disbelief, "How can this still be possible? Under the white light, it burns like crazy, even with a physical body as strong as I am - it's impossible to block it yet, and yet Luu was unaffected, still able to continue striking with his sword." This was incredible. "This is indeed an extremely ferocious sword," he said, "and this great Sun is simply impossible to Stave off."

This powerful sword stage came with an answer from an almost ferocious sword float Punisher, as it desperately staged to counterattack. "Royal terror attack," it seemed as if it could crush everything. However, it was simply difficult to stop. Every time the flame Lance in Luu's hand came out, his entire arm was almost ruined. Floating Light realized that it was the end and turned around to try to escape into the radiance of the Sun. Yet, another incredible sword chop came, carrying an attacking sword, with a sword like seeming to be able to destroy everything.

Paul returned to the ruins under the radiance, where the floating light's body was instantly churned into countless pieces. The instant a sunfield like a dream bubble, which seemed to have never existed in the first place, dissipated, amidst the stunned gazes of all the foreign Pride. Luu spoke again, "Though it is said again, again again Chapter 182." The moment these words came out, the final Battlefield suddenly became incredibly quiet, with more than 100,000 Prides staring at him in dismay and shock.

"Who can believe it? Three swords," they murmured, "It's only three swords, a domain 5-Powerhouse had fallen just like that." "But what was happening before these eyes?" it had to convince them, "That's the truth." Long before that, the Battle Power Luu showcased when he killed the Kagan Clan's Heavenly Pride with just a single sword was breathtaking. However, this was not enough to deter the 10,000 racist Celestial Proud who continued to judge Luu. There were still countless foreign Prides that coveted and longed for the 13,000 points Luu had obtained. When Luu said, "The next one, one by one," they came forward, even if Luu had sword after sword like cutting grass, frantically chopping away, he couldn't stop their madness.

The thoughts of these foreign Celestials were simple: A peak of the fourth realm had a limited amount of Chien energy, and it didn't take long for it to run out of strength. By then, it would just be a mere fish, to be slaughtered - even becoming Canon fodder. "Barefoot is not afraid to wear shoes," this first hurdle of the 10,000 Clans, Heavenly Pride battle was supposed to be incredibly easy for them. What was there to be afraid of? Just do it and be done with it. If you're going to be eliminated anyway, why not come and fight for riches?

However, when Luu at this moment, after three swords had killed a domain, fifth level, it was like a pot of cold water poured over your head. The prideful members of the foreign races who had originally planned to rush over and send them to their deaths finally calmed down. Even the fact that Luu repeated himself didn't intimidate them anymore. For a while, there was no more foreign Pride that dared to come forward. Everyone was freaked out. Floating Light was the second expert of the Sunclan Heaven's Pride Squad. "Ah, just die," was a short silence. The universe's major teams immediately erupted in a burst of exclamations, "This is the human Race's little Marshall Saint, what a terrifying Sword Art! No, his sword skills are indeed terrifying, but what's truly terrifying is his physical body."

"Flash right, didn't you realize that he was able to instantly Counterattack, under floating Light's domain five attack, as usual," that's right, Luu's human Race, little Marshall Saint, has an incredibly true reputation. When the Sunclan squad, the strongest Heavenly Pride, Heaven's Destiny, saw this scene, a hint of surprise flashed through his golden eyes, "A bit interesting. Good kill haha." In the Tain clan, Shuu was very happy, as she laughed and said it's really worthy of being the human Clan's little Marshall Saint.

The blood moon Clan's, Hijack, said softly, if he guessed correctly, he was following the path of fleshly body sainthood. The chaotic, ancient racist Tais, Su furrowed his brows, "Floating Light was careless, he didn't even expect this Luu's close combat to be so powerful." The Holy Spirit Clan, Yuan shook his head, "If floating Light had utilized the advantages of his domain to its extreme, this Luu wouldn't have won so easily." The star God races, rose up, and said with a smile, "With this kind of strength, you can probably enter the top 10, or so of this Heaven's Pride battle."

The vision of the supreme celestial beings, the Heavenly Prides, was formidable to an extreme degree. In this brief skirmish, they scrutinized a multitude of data, for which Luu was particularly adept. It was evident that close combat was Luu's forte, making it ill-advised to engage him in such a manner. Instead, one must utilize the advantage of domain space to its fullest extent.

The spectators from various human communities and major planets erupted in excitement upon witnessing the scene. Three types of beings were determined to eliminate the Sun Clan's Heavenly Pride. The little Marshall Saint of the humans was too powerful, contrasting starkly with the audience of all the races of the universe. One could not help but frown, not without a touch of depression. No one had anticipated that the human Race's little Marshall Saint would dare to challenge the 10,000 races' Heavenly Pride and still stand his ground. It was too much; it was hard to comprehend.

What was happening? Even powerful characters seemed unable to contain the human brat's arrogance. Suddenly, the scene before them left trillions of spectators from various races staring in disbelief. The 10,000 Clans' Heavenly Pride was engaged in its final battle. Luu raised his head, and Fong repeated, "Again, again." As a result, none of the foreigners dared to intervene; it seemed they were intimidated.

A three-sword formation to kill a domain fifth Heavenly Pride was too much, but Luu was undeterred. All were afraid to proceed. Luu blinked, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth. In that case, it was his turn. With no hesitation, Luu's figure moved. The white Jade Wind and Fire whirled beneath his feet, his speed increasing dramatically. In an instant, his entire body transformed into a stream of light, charging towards the 10,000 Clan's Heavenly Pride. He was only half a step away from breaking through the fifth realm. How was that possible?

Since the 10,000 racial Celestial Pride did not dare to approach, Luu took the initiative. He came to fight where millions would go. This incomparably audacious move left the cosmic 10,000 races of heavenly Pride stunned. Even behind Luu, Woo Wy, Yujing, and others were stunned, their jaws agape in disbelief.

"How did you just rush over there?" one asked in dismay. "This is not something that can be explained." Facing more than 100,000 celestials, even a marshal emperor furrowed his brow and thought in disbelief. Luu would never do anything meaningless, they reasoned. Soon, someone guessed it. They stared at Luu, fighting fiercely on the screen, and said thoughtfully, "Little Marshall Saint, is this an intention to break through in battle? Indeed, he's about to break through to the fifth realm in the middle of a battle (Chapter 183)."

Luu's madness shocked all the foreign racial Heavenly Prides. No one could understand why he dared to launch himself alone towards more than 100,000 Heavenly Prides, risking certain death. The martial artists of the human race were indeed crazy, but there were also some face celestials who reacted. "This guy is using us as a millstone," they thought. "He intends to break through to the fifth realm during the battle. We can't let him break through; kill him before he breaks through."

A crowd of celestial Prides felt humiliated at this moment, although they didn't feel that Luu's strength would change much when he broke through to the fifth realm. After all, both had mastered the domains. What difference could there be between the fifth realm and the fourth realm? But since it was Luu who wanted to go through with it, it had to be stopped at this moment. With Luu taking the lead in charging and killing, it would not be considered joining forces for these foreign race celestials to strike back. Boom, boom, boom, boom attacks that resembled a raging storm poured out in an instant, and this kind of terrifying energy fluctuation even the Heaven's Destiny Shu you and other Supreme Heavenly Prides couldn't help but be moved by it.

Previously, when the crowd attacked Luu, they were restricted by the rule that the heavenly Pride battle couldn't be joined together and at most a few could go together. However, at this moment, Luu was charging directly at many Heavenly Prides, attacking with hundreds, even thousands of attacks. Quantitative changes can cause qualitative changes; this human brat was indeed crazy.

Heaven's Destiny sneered, "I was planning to make a move to finish you off, but I didn't expect you to send yourself to death." This little Marshall Saint of the human race, this was something you could not think of. Shuu's beautiful eyes were filled with disbelief.

shock nope hijack frowned he's not dead this isn't even dead the flesh is so strong yuyuan was a bit surprised this little guy is crazy tyu couldn't help but Marvel in the center of a chaotic Battlefield luu was drenched in blood but his breath was getting stronger and his eyes were getting good very good that's it the two steps of precipitation and integration have already been taken and are only awaiting the final sublimation one more step to go then one more time however just then finally there was a supreme Heavenly Pride that couldn't help but make a move there was no way around it luu's 13,000 points were were just too fragrant Buzz Majestic Fields Sweeping in an ancient Bell that appeared above the sky and on top of that ancient clock sat a youth as the space around them rapidly transformed the many foreign races Prides all changed color and retreated backward it's him the lizard Dragon Clan's first Heavenly Pride moang of the lizard Dragon Clan a super expert at the peak of domain six and about to step into domain 7 this Heaven remarks battle at least the absolute Heavenly Pride that can rank in the top 10 damn it to actually strike at this time intending to pick a peach above the ancient Bell yuwang was expressionless as he spoke faintly idle people all get out of the way this little guy is this seats prey prey hearing this luu nonchalantly asked back just by virtue of you you deserve to see me as prey I thought who was coming such a big battle but after half a day it's only a domain sixth level what a spoiler yuang narrowed his eyes slightly and said faintly at a young age sharp teeth and sharp mouth when Lou you heard this he just smiled he glanced in the distance at the sun Clan tyin Clan blood moon Clan chaos ancient Clan and other powerful Clans and the aura of the Heavenly Pride captains of those powerful Clans was clearly more threatening they weren't even going to make a move after being so arrogant themselves that's so condescending from beginning to end it seemed that they did not place luu in their eyes at all and they were all wary of each other even if luu's sword had beheaded the sunclan second Heavenly Pride that sun Clan's first Heavenly Pride would have been able to hold back from making a move this guy is really tolerant where are you looking yuwang frowned and asked with some irritation you are domain six and the few over there they should be domain seven or even domain 8 luu asked with a smile they hold their own identity and are unwilling to get off the field from start to finish but you jumped out in a hurry does this mean that you are inferior to others as soon as these words came out Yu hang's face became extremely ugly as the saying goes a lie never hurts the truth is the fastest knife luu's words directly poked at his sore spot in terms of strength he could squeeze into the top 10 but compared to the first echelon's Heaven's Destiny shuu and other Supreme Prides he was naturally slightly inferior it's really inferior to others only the effect of saying this on your own can be completely different from someone else saying it what a lot of nonsense Yu hang snorted coldly then without any more nonsense he directly clenched his fist and flicked it up Buzz Dash the melodious sound of an ancient Bell instantly filled the entire domain this is a special kind of Sonic attack similar to The Great Sun domain of the sunclan Heavenly Pride floating light it was a Surefire attack as long as it was within the field it could not be dodged or avoided at this moment when luu heard this melodious bell sound he was dizzy and his body Shook and almost felt down directly without stabilizing himself Hof seeing this yuang smiled faintly but that's just it sure even so he still wasn't the least bit careless after all there was a foretaste of the sunclan floating light to take advantage of the field and utilize it to its fullest extent before saying anything UAV Wang clenched his fists once again and with each raise the ancient bell rang under the sound of one malif fluous Bell after another luu's figure continued to shake and eventually could not stabilize his body and fell directly to the ground not moving for a long time it seems to have fallen into a fainting spell after all if one dies one should be eliminated from the game outright seeing this scene y Wang smiled faintly his complexion filled with contempt as he said lightly what can you do if your flesh is strong this ancient Bell domain of mine the main attack is the one that directly targets the spirit and soul it just happens to restrain you The Reckless man who practiced the flesh body and practiced the way of the flesh body it's so easy it's over seeing this scene woo wow by you Jing and the others finally couldn't help themselves and immediately rushed over to help even though luu had already explained before this that he didn't have to come to his aid until he broke through the fifth realm but the problem was as a teammate how could one Stand By and Watch Leu get killed however the lizard dragon races Heavenly Pride Squad who had been on guard saw a few people rushing over and did not hesitate to come over to block them want to go over there and back it up go through them first you humans have teammates but we lizard dragons don't when they were directly stopped by the lizard Dragon Clan's Heavenly Pride woo wooi by youu Jing and

The others furrowed their brows; this isn't good. Not good. Not to mention whether we can even win the fight, even if we did, it wouldn't be over quickly. We wouldn't be able to go and help the situation. It seems we've reached a dead end. (Chapter 184: Double Breakthrough, Little Luu)

BYU Jing's face was ugly as he looked at Luu in the distance and bit his lip. "How should this be finished?" Sia frowned, letting out a bitter laugh. "My little captain, you've provoked the Heavenly Pride of the 10,000 Clan. It has too many tricks up its sleeve; it's impossible to defend against. We need to find a way to get the enemy to support us over there."

Gawan and the others immediately made a decision. The only way to salvage the situation was to have the second strongest, Woo SiiA, stand out and go to Luu's aid.

Captain Woo SiiA looked at Luu in the distance. After a moment, his heart raced. He made a split-second decision. The crowd let the strongest one stand out and go to Luu's aid. In this way, there might be a hint of a flip-flop possible.

Na plans are plans, and reality is reality. The Lizard Dragon Clan's Heavenly Pride Squad was strong, not inferior to anyone. Trying to break through in a short period of time was simply impossible. In that case, there's only one thing to do. Wuu SiiA's eyes gradually became determined. Breaking through to the fifth level of the domain was the only way to break through to the fifth level of the domain. Only then could they save the captain from the fire.

Wu's eyes were red, his domain covered, and he kept fighting in close quarters, charging desperately at this critical juncture. It actually did allow him to have an epiphany and gradually step into the fifth level of the domain. It's done. Wu SiiA's face was filled with ecstasy. This is the fifth level of the domain!

Just then, a sudden change occurred in the expectant gaze of the 10,000 tribes' audience. When Yuang came a little closer and was ready to strike to kill Luu, Luu, who was originally lying on the ground and seemed to have fallen into a coma, finally grabbed this opportunity and suddenly stormed up. He showed no signs of being affected at all and attacked directly.

Paul returned to the ruins. The speed of the sword was too fast, and when the sword light struck Yu Wang, he visibly froze for a moment with a look of dismay on his face. The only thought in his mind was, "How could that be?"

Yuang's reaction was quick as he violently retreated, but even so, an arm was still cut off. If it wasn't for the previous caution, even if Luu was unconscious, he didn't dare to directly get close to him and only attacked from a little farther away. Then, at this moment, the loss would not only be an arm but a small life.

Yu Wang screamed miserably and turned around to run while urging the big bell to continue launching attacks. Just then, Luu actually only frowned and sneered before continuing to kill in the depths of his sea of consciousness.

An absolute treasure, the Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul Suppressor Stone, was slowly operating, shielding most of the spiritual attacks outside. This was a treasure that Luu had obtained earlier in his life when he did a quest. The effect is straightforward; it can effectively protect the wearer's divine soul and sea of consciousness. In this world, a defense that could protect the soul could be considered incomparably precious, a few points more precious than a normal supreme treasure.

Under the effect of this treasure, Moon Brilliance's attack from this ancient bell domain was drastically weakened. Yuang fled in haste and instantly understood the cause. Luu was the son of a marshal saint of the human race and it was not surprising that he had treasures that could protect his soul. But after all, he was a domain sixth-level powerhouse or the peak of the sixth level, and his strength was extraordinary. In addition to attacks against the spirit and soul, this ancient bell domain naturally also had attacks against the physical body.

Yuang raised his hand violently, and in the sky above the realm, large black bells immediately appeared and smashed towards Luu. Luu was not the least bit afraid and did not give Yuang a chance to catch his breath at all. This opportunity was too rare; the opposite side was a Heavenly Pride at the peak of the sixth level of the domain, and it would be quite tricky if he kept killing Luu. Luu would end up winning, even if he won, it would be a disastrous victory. At that time, it would be very, very dangerous to then face the 10,000 Clans' Heavenly Pride.

as those few Supreme Heavenly Pride therefore this battle must be fought quickly he swung his sword out again pull sword prison Dang Dang Dang Dang compc attacks from the large black Bells were blocked by the sword prison kill without the slightest hesitation luu slashed out another sword Paul returned to the ruins take advantage of your illness uat Wang could not cry he totally did not expect to meet such a pervert and at this moment he already somewhat regretted standing out P another arm of Moon brilliant was sliced off and with the advantage of his domain he fled once again die luu followed closely behind swinging his sword and slashing again Yu hang stared in horror he would never be willing to be eliminated like this knowing that with his original strength he would at least be able to kill his way into the top 10 of the 10,000 racist Heavens Pride battle yet now to be eliminated at the first hurdle no way absolutely not his pride would never allow such a thing the humiliation came like a tidal wave at this moment of life and death past memories flashed before his eyes like a walking Lantern the aura flickered Moon Hanan grabbed it in one hand his eyes were wide with Madness I am enlightened I am enlightened so it was so it is haa this is the seventh level of the domain yuang was ecstatic as he raised his head violently and his entire domain gradually transformed into a large translucent Bell luu's deadly sword was actually blocked directly on the battlefield the situation was reversed luu who was originally ferociously pursuing the attack was restricted by this large translucent Bell and his movements became exceptionally slow for a moment Lui was a bit surprised that this guy actually broke through on the verge under his own stimulation but when you think about it it's normal after all this U Juan was the absolute pride of a powerful race was he not an easy man to deal with if it was really a bunch of dirt dogs then the pride of the 10,000 in this universe would all be a joke obviously this kind of absolute Heavenly Pride was definitely not simple Yu Juan who was still panick just now gradually regained his calmness on his face as he narrowed his eyes and looked at luu saying without any complacency I really didn't expect that you would have so many tricks up your sleeve to force me to the end of the mountain forcing me to break through to the seventh level of the domain however ever without you it would have been absolutely impossible for me to break through to the seventh level of the domain chopping off two of my arms you're proud enough I'll remember you little human chapter 185 what does it mean to be Invincible in the same realm tactical backward movement beyond the center of the battlefield the pride of the 10,000 races looked at this scene in Surprise this Moon hang he actually broke through at the last minute but it seems normal after all he was originally at the peak of the sixth level and was only one last point away from the seventh level it was not unusual for such a supreme Heavenly Pride to break through to the seventh level in a life and death situation the battle is coming to an end Heaven's Destiny said indifferently it looks like these 13,000 points are going to fall into his hands no sh you looked at luu in the battlefield and saw that his face was still calm he couldn't help but raise his eyebrows things don't seem to be that simple this battle isn't over yet this little fellow of the human race seems to have an undercurrent hijack whispered softly whom what's his bottom card a breakthrough to the fifth realm Oz frowned even if you break through to the fifth realm I'm afraid it will be hard to overturn the situation right Tai Su said indifferently breaking through from the fourth realm to the fifth realm will indeed result in some increase in strength but it's not a qualitative increase yuyuan narrowed his eyes slightly staring intently at luu in the center of the battlefield even if he breaks through to the fifth realm it's still impossible for him to turn the tables the seventh level of the domain this is a whole new level this is not the same as the front at all in the midst of the battlefield the plot peaked and then peaked again a sense of powerlessness arose when wuu saw the scene against the sixth level of the domain he could still help but this seventh level of the domain it was too simple to suppress him but even so even so he still has to strike Captain I'll help you wo shouted and was about to join the battlefield the big deal about this trip is death but it was just eliminated however just at this moment a sudden change occurred Wu's movement stalled no big brother he in the field of the ancient Bell facing Moon Brilliance top down gaze luu's face remained calm he slowly closed his eyes then opened them again the battle intent in his eyes was like fire until this moment facing the seventh level of the domain finally made him feel a little pressure that's right that's it without this pressure to urge him on it really wouldn't be good enough to complete the final step of sublimation and break through to the fifth realm you Yu Wong smiled contemptuously you want to break through too even if you break through what can you do it's just an increase in realm slightly more Chi and energy can it defeat my seven-fold domain luu smiled faintly and didn't argue his Aura gradually Rising was taking the final step at

this instant yuang suddenly felt a hint of something wrong luu's breakthrough didn't seem that simple no hesitation he made a direct move to strangle luu before he could make a breakthrough pity still late in just one breath luu had already stepped into the fifth Realm of the Marshall da the golden body realm he took this final step after all prior to this the Thousand inscriptions that luu had mastered were like ruthless floating weeds that did not bring out their full power however at this moment these inscriptions surrounded the circumference and quickly disappeared into luu's body and the original Power of these inscriptions was fully energized change and not only that along with The Disappearance of these inscriptions it was as if a stone had been thrown into a calm lake immediately stirring up countless Ripples and causing unexpected ch changes these thousand inscriptions are like the key that opens the door to the world of inscriptions once the gate opened countless inscriptions poured out instantly occupying luu's body these inscriptions cheering him on in celebration of him and becoming his temporary booster is this a breakthrough Vision as the son of a martial Saint luu was considered to have have seen a lot he knew very well that when breaking through to a certain realm it would produce the vision of extreme sublimation for example Marshall King realm Marshall Emperor realm and Marshall Saint realm breaking through to all three Realms would produce different levels of Visions but no one had yet been heard of who just by breaking through to the fifth Realm of the district had produced a vision odd it's too weird although it was strange luu was in a very good mood as he felt the terrifying number of inscriptions look and see what it means to be Invincible in the same realm tactical backward movement isn't it normal to be a little bullish since you're all turned on the moment with those countless inscriptions appearing the terrifying Aura spread unchecked and the Majestic Aura was like a mountain or a sea the powerful bindings of the translucent ancient Bell field instantly dissipated Moon Brilliance attack striking dis oce of inscriptions was like a breeze on the face without the slightest effect my attack mun hang was stunned the party's attack had no effect at all it was a little difficult for him to understand for a moment just breaking through to the fifth realm why was there such a big change general for them the Supreme celestials who had mastered the realm early on this advancement of the realm was just an increase in energy and it didn't do much for the increase in strength it was the comprehension and advancement of the domain that was the qualitative Improvement this was also the reason why he was very calm and collected after he had elevated to the seventh level of the domain he's got too big a lead but now luu had only broken through to the fifth realm and it actually made him feel threatened this how is that possible it was just a pre-existing realm enhancement on what basis could it fight against his own Sevenfold realm what does the seven-fold field mean this has stepped into the stage of great fulfillment of the field the way of the realm one initiation for proficiencies seven Great accomplishments and nine Perfections it's every important little stage inside the big stage of the field like what wua did breaking through from the fourth to the fifth level although it had a certain increase in strength it wasn't considered a qualitative leap therefore even if wua had broken through to the fifth level a sense of powerlessness inevitably arose in his heart when he was facing yuang who was at the seventh level of the domain it's safe to say when Yu hang stepped into the seventh level of the domain it meant that he had truly stepped into the first Echelon of the heaven Pride battle this was the reason why yuang had always felt victorious in his opinion even if Lu you broke through to the fifth realm it wouldn't change anything but now at the moment something doesn't seem right about the situation without the slightest hesitation mun hang quickly retreated that's what you're afraid of luu raised his head and looked at yuang who kept retreating and couldn't help but tease you've broken through the seventh level of the domain what are you still afraid of come on come over here and get in a fight let's see whether you're the one who broke through to the seventh level of the realm is powerful or I'm the one who broke through through to the fifth realm however mang acted as if he hadn't heard and was still rapidly pulling away in his opinion as long as he distanced himself enough from this fleshly invincible monster then he would have a chance of winning I'm at the seventh level of the domain the advantage is mine seeing this luu shook his head slightly then took out the bow behind his back the bow was like a full moon and the invisible arrows quickly coalesced at the same time countless inscriptions were gradually integrated into the arrow body the original formless Arrow had turned into an inscribed Arrow at this moment chapter 186 does it really have the Elegance of the human Marshall Sage back then the name of this arrow is godslayer Arrow luu narrowed his eyes and quickly locked onto Moon brilliant who kept retreating turning inscriptions into means of attack this move luu had seen it on the Guardians of the blue star University's trial mystery realm at that time his inscription detached from the Dharma body quickly coalesced into a black lance The Keeper of the past called it the king slayer's Lance at that time luu still knew little about it and couldn't learn

it even if he wanted to at this moment there was a sudden realization so he used it in a decent manner with the inscription integrated into the arrow body the power of this Arrow was terrifying before the arrow even left the string Yu hang felt bad the scalp felt like it was exploding he still has long range means yuang was alarmed at this moment although he had mastered the seventh level of the domain his strength aspect had skyrocketed however he was actually not in a good State having been chopped off two arms by luu successively it was simply difficult to recover in a short period of time if he was given some time to recover to his full strength with the seventh level of the domain he would still have the power to fight but luu obviously wouldn't give him another chance after a complete lockdown fingers released bow string back down few Dash the arrow of inscription instantly scurried out as a stream of light cutting through the air in a brilliant Ray in just an instant it chased after Moon brilliant yuang desperately resisted the invisible Golden Bell protecting his body only to hear a dang a sound the Golden Bell shattered U awan's body shook violently and although he was not killed by an arrow he could not help but spit out blood without the slightest hesitation luu pulled back the bow string once again Captain seeing this scene the lizard Dragon Clan's Pride was anxious no one expected that but in the blink of an eye the situation on the field reversed and then reversed again even though the captain had broken through to the seventh level of the domain he was surprisingly still undefeated against this human race little Marshall Saint there was no hesitation they wanted to come over for support haaha nice try wua laughed and turned straight back to stop it just now it was the lizard Dragon Clan's Heavenly Pride that prevented them from assisting now the situation is completely reversed he had pulled a few arrows to seriously injure Yu Wang before finding the right opportunity to directly kill this supreme Celestial Pride on the spot with a single sword strike luu's strikes could be described as fast accurate and ruthless a Heavenly Pride of the seventh level of the domain died just like that this scene caused the 10,000 rac's Heavenly Pride to tremble with fear no one was expecting it munang had broken through to the seventh level of the domain and was still slaughtered Fierce this little Marshall saint of the human race was just too ferocious it's over luu was slightly relieved this battle was pretty close the good news is that overall it went well and everything went according to plan the only thing that surprised him was that breaking through to the fifth realm had triggered a vision after killing Moon brilliant luu raised his sword and looked around at the surrounding celestials the look couldn't have been more blunt who else with this kind of power The Pride of all the races will not avoid its sharpness the earlier Covetous greedy gazes had all turned into fear at this moment one by one they all averted their gazes and lowered their lofty heads the moment luu was considered to have truly suppressed the Heavenly Pride of the 10,000 races of the universe of course there are a few exceptions the sun Clan's absolute Pride Heaven's destiny couldn't help but stare at Lu you with wide eyes and astonishment just breaking through the fifth realm how can the image he saw in his golden eyes was something else ever since luu had broken through to the fifth realm countless inscriptions invisible to the naked eye surrounded luu's body almost forming a kind of inscription domain and not far away the cold light in shu's eyes flickered as she also saw the scene the shock on her face was barely concealed a vision what kind of joke is this just breaking through to the fifth realm and there's actually a vision normally at the very least some Visions would be born only after breaking through from the seventh realm to the eighth realm stepping from domains to Worlds and shifting from inscriptions to rules but now luu had only broken through from the four realm to the fifth realm and a vision had appeared which was really not normal why why would there be a qualitative Improvement even if you simply raise your realm Yu Yuan was more than a little incredulous a living planet in a vast Universe between major starfields the many Spectators of the alien race were horrified when they saw this scene that was a supreme Heavenly Pride of the seventh level of the domain and he was chopped up just like that he even used his own power to shock the 10,000 tribes Heavenly Pride making all of them no longer dare to come forward nice guy it really has the style of the human martial arts sing back then in the meantime human communities The Spectators from all the major planets raised their arms and cheered all the spectators who stayed up late to watch the game were excited at the moment magnificent Mighty 10,000 Heavenly Pride little Marshall Sage cowp Pi the 10,000 races Heavens Pride War the final Battlefield l u who was located in the center of the battlefield no longer had the heart to fight with the Breakthrough to the fifth realm he had entered a marvelous state it felt like swimming in an ocean of inscriptions until this moment he didn't understand why someone could carve out hundreds of millions of inscriptions the stone tablet in the tower of reincarnation with a huge number of inscriptions turned out to be from this luu swept a glance at a short distance away and those few great Prides of the powerful

clans were looking at him in Surprise still without the intention of making a move since this was the case there was no other threat in this battlefield after luu returned to the team he opened his mouth and said find a corner of the battlefield I need to Enlighten myself for a moment or two you guys help me watch over it when wuu and the others heard this they were slightly stunned then they agreed yes no problem leave it to us Lu you no longer hesitated and immediately sat down to Enlighten himself he knew very well that the Visions would definitely not exist for too long that being the case it's important to take a good look at it right now he was barely able to squeeze into the first Echelon of the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle but it was still very very difficult for him to take the first place and capture the largest wisp of civilization's flame the only reason why Fawn was able to easily decapitate yuang was because he was severely injured and in an unstable State plus he had just made a breakthrough and was not yet able to skillfully master the seventh level of the domain luu on the other hand was able to use the power of the vision after the Breakthrough before he appeared to be able to easily and comfortably kill them with his hands if they waited for munang to return to his full strength it would definitely be a bloody battle so even after breaking through to the fifth realm one still could not take the enemy lightly much less feel outright Invincible otherwise it will inevitably lead to a crushing defeat got to guard against arrogance and move forward it's the only way to continue to get stronger in the meantime reverse entropy mysterious realm in a mysterious space look at the scene in front of you even that mysterious black robe reverse entropy Envoy revealed a look of surprise at this moment ha Lu Chang Shang smiled faintly and said indifferently I have delved into countless secret Realms and visited the civilizations of many reincarnations once on a stone tablet at a certain Relic I read a statement to that effect in addition to breaking through the eighth ninth and 10th Realms that will produce a vision there is another method where a vision can appear that is before the golden body is forged and the Dharma body is formed m mastering a thousand inscriptions and gradually integrating them into the physical body when one breaks through to the fifth realm one will have visions and see a whole new world now what do you think of this son of mine chapter 187 the biggest flame of civilization ever the reverse entropy Envoy couldn't help but be dumbfounded when he heard this it was only after a long time that he slowly opened his mouth and said I was the one who underestimated him the current him should be able to enter the top five or so oh when Li Chang xang heard this he just faintly answered that's already high enough to think highly of him the reverse entropy Envoy heard Lu changings meaning as he laughed and said the shua you and hijack from those six Heavenly Prides or existences at the eighth level of the realm second only to you back then the others they are also at the peak of the seventh level of the domain you should know clearly just how difficult it is to comprehend the domains that can only be controlled by the seventh realm to the seventh and eighth Realms during the fifth realm period all the races of the universe trillions of the five Realms have come to this 100 000000 Heavenly pride and out of these 100 0000 Heavenly Prides there were only a few absolute Heavenly Prides who mastered the seventh and eighth levels of the domain one of them just broke through and was slaughtered by your son he's already very good but unless he can go high again in a short period of time there's no way he'll get first place these words from the reverse entropy Envoy could be said to be justified and it is true luu had become stronger but there was still a long way to go before he got first place unless in a short period of time it surges forward again Lu Chang xang heard this and said without moving it's not impossible oh hearing those four words the reverse entropy Envoy turned his head to look at luu in the final Battlefield again then I will continue to look forward to it if he does get first place I'll share with him within my authority the largest strand of civilizations fire ever when these words came out Lu Chang xang smiled faint that's what you said the reverse entropy Envoy nodded indicating that he would not go back on his word Lu changing turned his head to look at luu in the picture seeing that he was not arrogant and continued to Enlighten himself he could not help but not his head well keep practicing keep getting stronger that has a chance if he could get the largest strand of civilization fire ever it would be a great benefit both for luu and for the entire human race 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle that final Battlefield the battle has entered its second phase an unbelievably crazy melee on the battlefield of less than a th000 square kilometers 100 0000 Heavenly Prides one after another displayed their own means different forms of dar arm a heaven and Earth Strange and bizarre domains colliding and fighting with each other boom boom boom boom boom terrifying explosions were heard one after another one after another The Majestic energy fluctuations made one scalp numb every moment there were countless Celestial Pride transformed into Shadows eliminated from

the game this scene is spectacular compared to the super melee at this moment luu's battle against the 10,000 races Celestial Pride earlier could only be considered an appetizer at best now that's a really big show in the corner of the battlefield wooi s Cliff gaan by yujing and the others were looking around vigilantly performing the task of protecting luu's enlightenment at this moment this final Battlefield was just too chaotic almost all of the heaven Pride squads were attacking each other and the situation was completely messed up woo wow D and others saw this situation can be said to be heartbreaking do not dare to guarantee that can complete the protection of the road task can only say that the best efforts to complete but gradually they realized that something seemed wrong with with the situation things were the opposite of what they expected it wasn't that they were doing their best to protect luu rather they relied on luu's Hefty reputation to stay here safely and watch the show those foreign race celestials didn't even dare to attack this site or even come close the battlefield in the distance fought a hot battle countless foreign tribal Prides fought and killed but they are here like a paradise a quiet and peaceful extinct wooo sya gaan and the others looked at each other in dismay not expecting things to go in this direction however it was right when one thought about it after all luu had previously killed a heck of a lot of people and shocked the 10,000 Clan's Heavenly Pride if it were not for that there would be no quiet and peace at this moment these foreign races heavenly Pride even if they were crazy and greedy they wouldn't dare to rush over and send themselves to their deaths look guys that seems to be the seventh level of the domain byuing suddenly saw something pointing at the distant Sun domain and couldn't help but open his mouth that's the sun Clan's absolute Pride the number one expert his name is Heaven's Destiny Woo's eyes lit up as he spoke ear earlier Captain luu decapitated the sunclan second pride and he actually didn't make a move gawan said with some surprise normal woo wooi smiled and nodded Legend has it that the tyin Clan's absolute pride shuu has already mastered the eighth level of the domain the strength is even more terrifying if this Heaven's Destiny goes down and fights with our captain and exposes some of his cars then the tyin clan shua will definitely strike it is precisely the casting of a rat that he dares not strike easily listening to Woo Woo's explanation Goan then came to a realization and understood the reason so that's it no wonder this is considered a boring loss yes wo Wy nodded those few absolute Heavenly Prides they are actually all in the same situation wary of each other not daring to strike easily not wanting to expose their own cards if those few absolute Heavenly Prides go down it will be very difficult for our captain to break through the battle good thing it still succeeded and it even killed a domain seventh level even if it was them I'm afraid they were all shocked Fon luu's intimidation of the 10,000 races of the universe was tantamount to take taking chestnuts out of the fire and there was no need to mention the risk it's a complete gamble bet he breaks through it was a gamble that he could withstand the alliance of the 10,000 Clan's Heavenly Pride gambling that those few Supreme celestials wouldn't go down easily one wrong move and you may lose the whole game good on Lu you still had the last laugh the glory of this moment shall be his wooo siia glanced at luu who was in the middle of his Enlightenment and his expression was filled with admiration in the meantime Chang XI s Yen Gaia Juan in choping and AO hongan on the other hand didn't chat idly and focused on the incomparably chaotic Battlefield in the chaotic Battlefield the 10,000 racist Celestial Pride all brought out their skills these foreign celestials were mostly Dharma phases Dharma phase void Dharma phase minor Dharma phase major and Dharma Heaven and Earth as for those who could control a domain even if it was a domain fledgling it wasn't a rare site don't look at Chang XI sunen Gaia Juan in choping AOH hongan five people just mastering the domain fledgling not even entering the real domain one in fact placed in the 100 0000 Heavenly Prides it has already been considered the upper level that's normal after all the domain was a skill of a seventh realm Grandmaster and it was naturally difficult to comprehend and master it in advance at the fifth realm only a Heavenly Pride among Heavenly Prides could could have made it this far as for those absolute Heavenly Prides at the seventh and eighth levels of the domain they were absolute Monsters of talent originally there was no one in this term of the human Race's Heavenly Pride who could compete with these few absolute Heavenly Pride even if wua broke through during the battle he was still only at the fifth level of the domain and the Gap was still not small but the good thing was there was now one more luu the little Marshall saint of the human race chapter 188 advancing to the fourth level obtaining the nine Leaf Spirit pill and the moonflow slurry liquid as the minutes ticked by the bloody and brutal melee soon came to an end the successive battles shattered the Earth of the final Battlefield magma erupted seawater poured in and torrential rain fell from the sky interspersed with hail Stones as the fighting continued the climate became extremely harsh even so the fighting still didn't stop until the universe 10,000

races Heavens Pride Squad when there were only a thousand teams left that's the end of the first level at this moment a prompt appeared before the eyes of all the celestial Pride the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride battle ends here the many contestants who still survive receive tickets to the next level other than that the Manifest Destiny of the sun Community the solstice of the tyin community the hijacking of the blood moon Clan chaos ancient clans tyu yuyuan of the Holy Ghost Community OSS of the star God Community L you of the human race in view of the strength of these seven contestants who surpassed the other contestants by too much they automatically skipped the second and third hurdles and entered the fourth or final hurdle stage in advance to gain a seat in the battle of the 16 the second level hadn't even started yet and the seats for the top 16 battles in the fourth level were occupied by seven seats when this news came out the pride of each Clan reacted differently many of the face celestials felt that this was really unfair why should they be allowed to advance early and directly skip the second and third hurdles however more of the face celestials felt that this was simply too Fair they were so strong that if they were allowed to participate in the second and third levels it would be pure and simple frying of fish with absolutely no suspense whatsoever it was better to let them advance to the final battle stage now instead or at least the probability of advancing themselves would be higher countless murmurs Lu U who had ended his Enlightenment opened his eyes just in time to see this scene and said with some surprise it can still be like this in that case the mission sure enough next the completion prompt for the system Quest appeared stage two Mission kill the finalists and enter the main stage completed Mission reward 9 Elixir already issued stage three Mission make a name for yourself in the main competition and enter the top 16 of the 10,000 clans of heavenly Pride Mission reward lunar flow plasma has been issued L you couldn't help but blink not expecting such a surprise at all originally I was thinking that I would have to keep fighting to get these two rewards who would have thought that it would be a direct step since this was the case there was only the last stage of the mission to ascend to the first place of the 10,000 races Heavens pride and obtain the champion of the heavens Pride battle fighting for the human race to obtain the greatest Ray of civilization's flame you only need to complete this quest to get the final stage Quest reward the thay purple gold pill the rewards of the previous few quests although good we definitely inferior compared to the rewards of this final stage that's the way it is with system quests the harder the quest the better the reward will be speaking of which what would be the effect of this nleaf Spirit pill in lunar flow syrup liquid thinking this way Lou you hurriedly scaned the details of the two Mission rewards this time nine Leaf Elixir rank eighth quality perfect type consumable effects after taking it it can drastically increase the strength of the essence blood in the body causing it to improve in all aspects making it more compatible with inscriptions in gradually giving birth to spirituality from the essence blood thus continuously nourishing the physical body this is the extreme stage of the blood transformation realm description nine Leaf continuous stem Ganoderma grass native to the great luo heaven in front of the Hall of spiritual void the the nine Leaf Elixir made from this is a superb Elixir used for blood exchange just by scanning the information of the nleaf spirit pill luu's eyes lit up sure enough it was just as he had guessed the Jade bone pill that he had previously obtained had catalyzed the root bones to the extreme saving luu a lot of time the five impregnated Spirit pill obtained afterward strengthened the five viscera to the extreme again saving luu a lot of time now this nleaf Spirit pill was also a precious medicine that pushed the blood transformation realm to the Limit stage today luu was so focused on killing monsters and upgrading that he didn't have the time to polish it in detail not to mention raising spirituality from the essence blood so naturally he couldn't go to the theoretical limit stage of the blood transformation realm however the appearance of this nine Leaf Spirit pill made up for luu's shortcomings in this realm since then the roots are bound to be more perfect good good stuff luu didn't think much about it and hurriedly glanced at the effects of the moonflow slurry lunar syrup rank eth quality perfect type consumable effect after taking it it can greatly enhance the strength of the golden body raising the upper limit of the golden body to the theoretical nine turns description the Moonlight contains the emperor flow pulp the shape of which is like 10,000 Golden Threads hanging down to earth grasses and trees can become demons if they are subjected to it and foxes and ghosts can manifest magical powers if they eat it the lunar stream syrup liquid refined from it is extremely beneficial to the refining of the golden body after reading the description of the effects of the lunar streaming syrup Lou us eyes were filled with joy nine turns of the golden body this was the fifth realm of martial arts the golden body realm the theoretical limit most of the martial artists with decent qualifications just cultivated into the fifth and sixth Revolutions of the golden body and reached their limits having to transform into

Dharma bodies in order to go further only some of the top Heavenly Prides could cultivate to the seventh and eighth revolutions those who cated to the theoretical limit of the nine turns of the golden body were even more rare even Marshall pierless was only an eight turn golden body it wasn't that he didn't want to cultivate to the ninth turn it was really that he couldn't proceed any further than the eighth turn what is important to realize is that with one less turn in the golden body there will also be one less layer in the Dharma body after this it's more of a step down and a step up if the foundation was not extreme enough even if you were to be sealed as a king and become an emperor at a later stage you would still be destined to be a great deal worse than others this was how some very vain Marshall Kings who had been reverse fell by great Masters came to be just as luu was pondering all this wooo sya gaan bayu Jing and the others on the side also saw the briefing and subconsciously looked at Lou seeing that his face was filled with joy he thought that luu was happy about the early advancement Captain congratulations congratulations on the early advancement it's straight to the final level the battle of the 16 congratulations Captain the captain is amazing the crowd congratulated and envy was palpable there was no one who was jealous because this was what luu deserved previously luu had killed a supreme Heavenly Pride at the seventh level of the domain shocking all the races in the universe and this battle performance was truly terrifying advancing to the final battle stage in advance was conversely a protection mechanism for the other Heavenly Prides the so-called jealousy often only arises when the Gap is not too big and once the Gap is too big then there is only pure envy and admiration soon with the specific news of this promotion it was spread to the 10,000 races of the universe amongst the major races no doubt about it it caused a direct uproar chapter 189 a sudden change in style when it comes to him as the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle ended some people are happy and some people are sad among them the one that attracted the most attention was that those seven Great Prides Advanced ahead of schedule directly skipping the second and third levels and coming to the fourth level locking up seven seats in the top 16 battle to be treated so favorably to be so special was enough to prove the terror of their strength if there were no accidents the champion of this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle should be decided from among them these seven great pride not only the human community within a variety of discussions but also by the universe of all Races countless beings used to Crazy discussion for the melon eating group the most favorite thing to do is to argue in order to verify these seven Great Heavenly Prides who would actually win the championship countless beings among the major star domains could be said to be quarreling the heat is simply off the charts but the the most popular Heavenly Pride among them belonged to the human Race's luu as the other six were all painted in a very normal style each and every one of them had cultivated for more than 10 or 20 years and had mastered the seventh level of the domain or even the eighth level of the domain during the fifth realm period it's basically not that different except for the different fields only luu is different the picture changes abruptly when it comes to him he's actually 4 years old this year cultivation is even only 2 years old this information simply should not be outrageous all the foreigners who saw luu's detailed information were all jaw-dropped and couldn't believe their eyes for a moment unlike the path taken by the other six Celestial Pride luu took the path of Flesh becoming a saint and the Dharma phase did not expand into a domain but rather it further strengthened the flesh body from the outside in luu's terrifying physical body even if the seventh level of the domain got close I'm afraid that he wouldn't be able to resist and would be directly torn apart in minutes the good thing is there have now been two hard Lessons Learned one was floating light of the sunclan fifth in the realm one was Moon hang of the lizard Dragon Clan who was at the sixth level of the domain and had broken through to the seventh level of the domain during the battle the two great Heavenly Prides had both died tragically in luu's hands the other six Heavens Pride should have learned this lesson many of the alien Spectators when they saw luu's detailed information even produced a feeling of Celebration okay this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle had started early and luu of the human Clan was only 4 years old when he came over to participate in the battle if we give him a few more years when he grows to the peak of the fifth realm and the way of Flesh becoming a saint is even more extreme who else can block his front you Heaven's Destiny or shuu or hijack taisu Yuan or Os I'm afraid that you won't even be able to break through anyone else's defenses by then without exaggeration absolutely invincible in the same realm it's not even a stretch to be able to fight six with one this was the case with lu Chang Chang back then Undisputed speed pass 10,000 plans Heavens Pride battle it's a good thing that time is not on the side of the human race luu had not fully grown

and when he first entered the competition he was even only at the Third Realm spare him the chance to get a strand of the flame of civilization however luu had nothing to do with winning the title and would not get the biggest strand this was the only thing that the audience of the 10,000 races of the universe especially the audience of those few powerful races had to be thankful for of course there were also quite a few powerful Clans that were bickering at the moment because they hadn't even Advanced the evil God Clan For example because he went to actively provoke luu and ended up causing his own regiment to be annihilated Instead at this moment within the evil God Community it could be said that there were verbal attacks chickens flying and dogs jumping around and it was quite Lively in the human Community naturally there was a lot of laughter luu Advanced to the top 16 in advance even if it was not expected that the other nine Heavenly Prides they all peacefully broke through to the second level in the past when participating in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle at least two or three or even half of the people would have to fold at the first hurdle but this time relying on luu's toughness all of them passed the test successfully which was really a joyful thing it would be great if someone could break through the second and third hurdles kill their way to the fourth hurdle and meet up with luu in the top 16 battle the last time it went this well was the session that Marshall St L changing participated in when he was young under the expectant gazes of the countless Spectators of the human race the second level of the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle soon began but the result is it wasn't too good at the second level only three people Wu wuky gaan and had passed by yujing Chang XI Sun yen giaan in choping and AOH hongan were all eliminated from the game there are times when things just don't work out the way they should as the saying goes the higher the expectations the greater the disappointment this harsh reality pulled everyone back to reality at once in this session of the heavens Pride battle the overall strength of the human race wasn't very strong and the only ones who were strong were individuals soon two more days the third level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was unschedule siaya and gaan two people were eliminated successively only Wu Wy who had broken through to the fifth level of the realm was still quite resilient and killed his way all the way to the third level of the final battle this next battle could be considered crucial as long as you won you would be able to qualify for the fourth level the top 16 battle even luu who was planning to go into seclusion came over to watch the battle specifically to cheer for wuky as long as he could win the human race would have two spots in the top 16 and if they were a bit luckier they would even have a chance to get two strands of the flame of civilization this is really something to look forward to in this battle wua Sia's opponent was the Holy Spirit Clan second day Pride whose name was rain and in terms of strength just like Wu he was at the fifth level of the domain however the slight difference was that Wu usia was at the beginning of the fifth level of the Dom while you was already at the peak of the fifth level there is a gap between the two sides but it's not huge and there's still a chance to win this rain was a slim man in his 30s wearing a white suit his face was as pale as paper coughing from time to time and he looked like he was in a very weak State at his side was Yu youan the Holy Spirit tribes number one Heavenly Pride who was speaking to him in a low voice seemingly explaining something facing you youan rain looked extraordinarily formal with a respectful posture nodding his head every now and then luu retracted his gaze as he looked at Wu usia and asked are you sure Wu's eyes were like fire as he nodded his head and said there is no absolute certainty but my success or failure in these 20 years of cultivation depends on today After experiencing the intense battles in the second and third levels wua had obviously grown some more and his strength was much stronger than in the first level hearing this luu smiled and said I'll be waiting for you in the top 16 battle I don't want to meet you wuu siia said with a smile soon the battle was about to be fought reain of the Holy Spirit race walked up to the large ring and calmly look towards luu's side wuu hurriedly stood up and took a step towards the top of the Ring the moment whether it was the Holy Spirit Community or the human Community all the viewers of the two powerful communities were all watching the live broadcast screen intently this battle was going to give birth to a seat in the top 16 battle it's importance cannot be overstated chapter 190 he's in a hurry the fourth and final level of the tournament is simple 16 to8 8 to 4 4-2 2 to one theoretically Li you only needed to win four consecutive matches to get first place in the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle it's as simple as that as for the acquisition of the flame of civilization it is equally simple just need to finish in the top 10 so even if you fail in the first round

of 16 at8 you can still participate in the losers bracket the losers bracket at this stage like the winnner bracket is 8 to4 4-2 and two to one but the Winner's bracket is fighting for first and second while the losers bracket is fighting for just 9th and 10th it is worth mentioning that there is no Resurrection match mechanism in the 10,000 Clans Battle of the pride of heaven so a loss is a loss and there's no chance of killing it back if they came up with a strong collision and fell directly in the first round they could only get Ninth Place at best this tournament system might be a bit unfair to The Unlucky Jedi Pride but on the other hand luck is part of strength and if you can't get lucky you just can't if you really have the strength to win the championship then naturally you will not be afraid of anyone and there will be no bad luck in other words if one was a bit more lucky and got into the fourth level by chance and hadn't encountered those seven absolute Heavenly Prides then one would be able to directly get a strand of the flame of civilization anyway whether it was for the human race were the Holy Spirit race this fourth level slot was not to be missed the of gunpowder was drawn right through this battle before it even started after both sides mounted the stage there were no pleasantries let alone politeness as the match began and the Death Match began straight away boom boom the two sides Unleashed their respective domains constantly colliding and frantically seizing the space of the ring in terms of the situation wua was slightly inferior only occupying two- fifths of the ring but the Holy Spirit Clan's Reign on the opposite side occupied 3- fifths of the space like his name his domain space was a storm space the rainstorm was like a torrential downpour and in just a few moments the ring was turned into an ocean outside the secret realm of counter entropy gaan siya by yujing and the others who had been eliminated successively were not in a hurry to leave but instead waited over here for woi and luu to finish their match at this moment several people frowned when they saw the scene gawan said with some concern in terms of domain Collision wuu is obviously slightly inferior yes the opponent is at the peak of the fifth level of the domain Fong Guang the president of blue star University nodded it's fortunate that wooy had previously broken through to the fifth level as well otherwise the disadvantage would have been even greater although slightly inferior in terms of domains wooy is not without a chance outside the ring yuyuan glanced at The Clash of domains in the ring and couldn't help but not as if it was a sure win then glanced at luu the look couldn't have been more blunt luu felt such a gaze and without ceremony directly glared back it's just a matter of losing a domain sparring match it's not like he lost a battle so what are you so proud of yuyuan smiled slightly a look that seemed to say there wasn't really much suspense in winning or losing this battle the gap between the two sides was obvious luu snorted coldly as if to say opening champagne at halftime won't end well yuyuan reached out and pointed to the center of the ring as if to say don't you know by looking for yourself above the ring not only were the domains sparring the two sides were fighting against each other and wuu was likewise slightly inferior and the battle had only begun for a while before he had already fallen into a disadvantage and looked to be in Jeopardy if this continued and the domain was gradually swallowed when the domain sovereignty was completely lost then wua would not have a single possibility of winning at this moment above the ring the rain was rapidly devouring the space of the domain that originally belonged to woia Woo's close combat was like constantly hitting cotton the disadvantage was getting bigger and bigger if it wasn't for the domain effect constantly unloading its power I'm afraid that at this moment he would have already been eliminated this rain was indeed powerful and this rainstorm field of his could be considered completely different from the ordinary natural environment those rains had negative effects such as strong acid corrosion and defense breaking and could even injure a person's spirit and soul gradually wua had fallen into a desperate situation and the domain space was gradually being eaten away with only 1/5th of the space left the winner is about to be revealed it's over in the ring rain gently raised his hand to deliver a fatal blow to woy just then Wu's eyes suddenly widened and a strange smile appeared on his injury-ridden face I've got you ha rain furrowed her brow before she realized something was wrong you dash the domain space that had originally been encroached upon and eaten Away by the rain at this moment it had even rapidly changed hands and at least half of the space had returned to Wu wy's hands but it was enough on the ground the en and young fish kept spinning up Rain lowered his head staring at the scene in dismay it was then that he realized it turned out that these domain spaces were bait that woia had intentionally put out for the purpose of This Moment's Counterattack it had to be said that this human martial artist guts were really too big even taking the initiative to give up the domain sovereignty if he himself was more careful and did not give him the opportunity to attack more patience and put these occupied domains under complete control then he

will have no more room to struggle obviously it's a a big gamble bias wo Wy won the BET despicable human figure it all out in a Flash rain gritted his teeth and raised his head again wua had gotten close in terms of close combat wua was not as good as luu but that did not mean that he could not do it on the contrary what wuu was best it was close combat at this moment close body entanglement and then do not give rain a chance to escape just a moment it will be seriously injured and then a moment later rain was directly knocked out of the game the winner is already decided woo woo win successfully killed the fourth level and earned a spot in the Battle of 16 seeing this yuan's face was ugly as he violently stood up and stared at Wu dead in the face he then cursed in annoyance you human race do you only use these underhanded and Despicable methods hearing this luu couldn't help but laugh anxious he was anxious what's all this talk about dirty tricks the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle is still about this it's a fight for the fires of civilization it's a great world World struggle you think you're playing alone this Holy Spirit Clan's number one Heavenly Pride was too childish luu didn't even bother to argue he just glanced at him and stopped looking yuyuan felt that he was despised or despised by a small child and his face darkened then he also knew that it was pointless to say anything after losing at this moment Yu Yuan coldly released we'll see you at the fourth level luu was somewhat speechless when he heard this is that a Hardline big brother we're supposed to be Rivals how did it feel that this yuyuan of the Holy Spirit Clan was a bit too innocent among the universe's 10,000 races absolute Heavenly Prides there was actually a Heavenly Pride with such a personality that existed chapter 191 even if you succeed in the final four not without a chance you uan turned around and left after letting out his harsh words Wu this jumped down from The Ring smiled and said it's a bit of a victory you're called courageous and resourceful luu said unimpressed you let go of so much domain space for nothing that Holy Spirit Clan's Heavenly Pride didn't even see it and since you're so stupid you deserve to lose wuky nodded and said with emotion sort of a fluke I didn't T expect to really win the bet and sure enough this Holy Spirit Clan is really like the rumors all the Heavenly pride of their group have a lower IQ Lu you heard this and asked curiously you can't say that wooa shook his head they call this holy quality as the beginning or Pure Heart of the da at first I thought it was a rumor but seeing as the opposite side was more innocent I tried it and I didn't expect it to be successful no wonder that the Holy Spirit Clan second Heavenly Pride where the first Heavenly Pride scolded you for being despicable and actually didn't know that a soldier never tries to be deceitful luu didn't even know what to spit out for a moment this is really the universe is so big there is nothing strange I didn't expect the Holy Spirit Clan's Pride to be so simple and still be so powerful when you think about it it makes perfect sense as the saying goes there are a 100 people in all shapes and sizes not to mention all the races in the universe Perhaps it is this Simplicity that makes them so powerful saying this was woooa bullying the little cutie with Wu Wy defeating his opponents he managed to break through to the fourth level the entire human race cheered and boiled since the end of the first level the battle conditions of the human celestials in these days could be described as very unsatisfactory six were eliminated from the second level the third level eliminates two people luckily Wu waxi had killed the fourth level or else all but Lu you would have been wiped out the next fourth level if you can win one you can get a strand of the flame of civilization in terms of competitive intensity the fourth level is far inferior to the first second and third levels but in terms of competitive difficulty the previous three levels even when added together could not be compared to the fourth by the fourth level any win will be incredibly tough theoretically winning four in a row will win you the title but it's only a theory and it's a lot harder to actually do it after the end of the third level there were roughly 3 days before the start of the fourth and final level of the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle this was considered to be giving the top 16 absolute Heavenly Prides a time to rest and prepare some Celestial Pride took advantage of this time to continue refining themselves in an attempt to go even further there was a Heavenly Pride frantically collecting all kinds of Intelligence on his opponent thinking that knowing oneself and knowing the enemy would be the best way to fight a hundred battles there was tinio doing nothing but simply resting using this to adjust his State there were even Heavenly Prides that sent out invitations to other opponents to spar and play friendly training matches to improve each other wo wooo then received several invitations from the foreign Race's Heavenly Pride this was within the rules of the heavens Pride battle that allowed it when he came over over and told luu about it luu couldn't help but be a bit surprised how come I didn't receive an invitation you actually didn't receive an

invitation hearing this wua couldn't help but be a bit surprised I thought you had received an invitation as well no lu you shook his head the same human race how come they are still treated differently it could be because you're too strong wuu said after some thought of course it's also possible that it's because you don't have a domain and aren't able to achieve a better training effect so no F Heavens pride has invited you to play in a training match all right luu nodded and didn't take this matter to heart he would just cultivate in seclusion and there was no need to play any training matches Captain you say I'm going to play a training match Marshall and Vin principal inquired he had come over to discuss this matter of course luu thought for a moment and said the training matches within the rules allowed for the heaven Pride battle so even if you lose miserably there's no harm in it and you might just be able to go further I See Marshall Invincible nodded and then went to his appointment for the training match with great excitement it wasn't long before w returned with his head hanging down and found luu once again the training match didn't turn out too well luu guessed right I thought that the result might not be good but I didn't expect that the result would actually be this bad woooa nodded and continued I went over this time and fought against five foreign tribesmen Heavenly Pride each playing two matches which means that there were a total of 10 matches and the result was actually lost all 10 games speaking the last few words wua siia spoke through gritted teeth obviously upset luu couldn't help but Furrow his brows when he heard this although he had guessed that Wu's training match had not turned out too well he had not expected it to be poor gave me a beating that made me close to autism woooo said somewhat depressedly difficult two difficult of those five three of them are domain six two are Peak domain five almost all of them crushed me none of them look like the Holy Spirit Clans Fools having entered the final stage the difficulty will naturally be great Lu you said with emotion yes Captain you should also be more careful although Captain is very strong those few domain 7 or even domain 8 Supreme Heavenly Prides are equally unfathomable Marshall Invincible said seriously I know luu nodded during this period of time he first comprehended the inscription Vision then ate the nine Leaf Spirit pill and used up the lunar stream slurry liquid and once again his basic aspect was improved in terms of overall strength it's kind of gotten a lot stronger now that he was facing the absolute Heavenly Pride of the seventh level of the domain there was no guarantee of an absolute Victory or at least a high chance of winning however if they were to face the eighth level of the domain although there was some chance of winning they would definitely lose more than win in a nutshell 16 into 8 obtaining a ray of of the flame of civilization is not difficult 8 to four also has a fighting chance and a good chance of winning but it would be very difficult to kill two out of four to get to the finals or even one out of two to win the title unfortunately the time to rest and prepare is still too short if you can practice for an extra month or two like you did during the time of The Reincarnation Tower then Lou you would also be more certain nay the time is not right for once time was not on his side outside the reverse entropy secret realm Fong Guang the president of blue star University his expectation of Lu you was that the top four would be considered a success Communication phone in Fong Wang said more than once there is no need for too much psychological pressure just let it go as long long as they got the top four they would be able to share enough of a strand of the flame of civilization which was slightly less than the winner and runner up but it was quite okay is the final four considered a success inside a quiet room luu murmured Softly As far as the overall situation is concerned what president fun Quang said was not wrong and his judgment was accurate it was indeed difficult for luu to win the title and it was better to lower expectations rather than stress so much but Lu you was not willing since we came to this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle how can we just get by saying that the top four is considered a success after thinking hard for a long time about the way to break the situation luu suddenly thought of something and his expression moved slightly no not without a chance chapter 192 a brand new unprecedented path of martial arts in the system storage space inside were neatly arranged rewards from previous quests among them was a fiery red fruit named Vermillion fruit it wasn't of a high grade only of the sixth rank but the effect was very good after taking it it can strengthen the physical body increase cultivation and prove the physique to a certain extent the description is even more explicit 100 years out of the leaves 100 Years of flowering 100 Years of fruit 300 years of mature Heaven and Earth wonders practicing martial arts people eat can increase the power of a sun a nail in the coffin an armor is 60 years if Lu you was allowed to cultivate for 60 years even if he could not become a martial Saint he would at least be a marshal Emperor however this Vermillion fruit grade

was only of the sixth rank so there was no way it would be this effective the so-called one armor of kung fu should only be a false reference an approximate number or an ordinary martial arts practitioner who has practiced for 60 years regardless the results are definitely good this Vermillion fruit before this luu had not dared to take it easily because the description hinted that if the flesh is not strong enough do not take it casually otherwise there is a certain probability of bursting and dying to this day luu had taken the path of becoming a saint In the Flesh and had also broken through to the fifth realm so there would be no problem taking this Vermilion fruit without hesitation luu L ate this Vermilion fruit just one take then he felt a warm current enter his stomach which then quickly flowed into his Limbs and his body felt warm all over this energy was not as violent as imagined instead it was unusually docile after entering luu's body it rapidly increased his cultivation level but in the blink of an eye the golden body came from the first turn to the second turn this effect was much faster than luu expected and the expected energy storm that might have occurred showed no signs of happening at all luu was a bit surprised on second thought it shouldn't be that this energy is too tame rather it was because his current physical body was too strong as well as his foundation was too solid so even if this energy was raging it couldn't make any waves the current luu was long gone from the person he was a year or two ago without much thought luu closed his eyes and began his cultivation what he lacked the most right now was time and the effect of this vermillian fruit would allow him to save most of his cultivation time and shortened the gap between him and those absolute Prides a day later when luu opened his eyes again he had already arrived at the ninth turn of the golden body realm at this point the energy contained in this Vermilion fruit was completely consumed coming to the ninth turn of the golden body luu could feel that his overall strength had risen another notch but that's not enough far from it trying to rely on breaking through to the ninth turn of the golden body to defeat those at the eighth level of the realm was obviously not very realistic let's just say that the odds of winning are slightly better the reason was also very simple those absolute Heavenly Prides of the eighth level of the realm were more than just the ninth turn of the golden body they were still at the ninth level of the Dharma body they had already gone to the Limit within the five Realms he had also taken the skill domain that was only Mastered by a seventh realm Grandmaster and walked it to the realm of great accomplishment with that strength even if an idol Grandmaster came over they would not be their match luu had gotten a little stronger again at the moment only allowing the Gap to narrow slightly luu didn't think much about it and once again looked at the system storage space there is such a potion inside pills for breaking the boundary level six thorder quality perfect type consumable effects after taking it it can help one break through bottlenecks and raise the upper limit of one's realm description this is a superb Elixir but it is not omnipotent it is only recommended for martial artists below the seventh realm and martial artists in the seventh realm and above will have minimal effect after using it this Elixir if it was to maximize its utility should be used by a sixth realm patriarch so that he could use it to break through to the seventh realm bottleneck and become a great patriarch however for luu nowadays it was quite a chicken rib it was because he controlled over a thousand inscriptions and had taken the path of fleshly sanctification there was no longer any such thing as a bottleneck when breaking through from the fifth realm to the seventh realm it just needs to be precipitated integrated and then sublimated for a smooth breakthrough in that case might as well eat ahead of time to save a little time is all early on he broke through from the golden body n revolutions to the Dharma body realm in this way the fourth level of the battle would also be more certain it's a bit of a waste but it can't be helped because it's an emergency the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle is more important just don't care about this waste without hesitation luu took this realm breing pill only once the realm breaking pill was imported it transformed into a cool breath that instantly spread throughout the body Lu youu only felt that the spirit platform was extraordinarily ethereal gradually he entered an extremely subtle State however it was completely different from the outcome L you had expected what he originally wanted was to rapidly break through to the Dharma body realm from the nine Revolutions of the golden body but because there is no bottleneck the mysterious Aura brought about by the realm breaking Dan was obviously a bit confused breaking through from the ninth turn of the golden body to the first layer of the Dharma body doesn't have a bottleneck ah you're asking me to do this Flack at a mosquito what's wrong with you even a slight bottleneck meaning will break the realm for you as a result you have no bottlenecks at all which is not the mysterious Aura brought about by the realm breaking Dan was confused for a while and went around in circles for a long time eventually the goal was placed

on the nine turns of the golden body nine turns of the golden body is that the limit I don't think so in the dark L you had such a feeling above the nine Revolutions of the golden body there seemed to be a new realm how is that possible luu felt a bit in credulous it was clearly recorded in the history of human martial arts that the upper limit of the golden body stage was the nine Revolutions of the golden body which was already the limit of the golden body realm how many amazingly talented martial arts Masters had only gone as far as the ninth turn of the golden body with no way to go further however at this moment luu had the chance to find A New Path luu let out a deep breath and quickly adjusted his State he began to search for that brand new path that had never been seen before with the help of the subtle Aura of the realm breaking pill however the boundary breaking pill was only a six order Elixir after all although it was a superb Elixir the medicinal effect was ultimately not powerful enough the goal is ambitious but it's obviously unlikely to achieve that goal luu furrowed his brows feeling the rapid depletion of the realm breaking pills subtle Aura but still unable to find that brand new path if this continued the mysterious Aura of this realm breaking pill would not be able to find A New Path even after it was consumed no way this won't work underl 's conscious Drive within his body the tiue diffractive Dharma pill as well as the taiu immortal cells began to slowly operate with the addition of these two ninth order Supreme Treasures the situation was instantly reversed the subtle Aura of the boundary breaking pill was like a Vanguard team specializing in beating the headlights finding ways to find that brand new path and going Reckless one after the other and the taiu defra of Dan was like the main Brigade a solid backing for the boundary breaking Dan constantly providing support while also constantly contributing to the search along with it as for the tiue immortal cells they were like a logistical Force specializing in some auxiliary work providing constant coordination between both the boundary breaking pill and the tiue defraction pill a perfect triangle is achieved chapter 193 Marshall da golden Dan the Resonance of the ocean of rules realm breaking pill tiue defraction pill and tiue Immortal cell between the three a delicate balance was reached at the moment for a moment louu entered a more subtle State take away take away take away every moment every second luu was all in a constant state of epiphany gradually the fog that had been trapped in front of the Body for so long was gradually lifted slowly the road which had been exhausted was forced open the road which continues onward luu is on a bumpy road constantly searching for A New Path unfortunately even with the cooperation of the realm breaking pill the great void defraction pill and the great void Immortal cells that brand new path still wasn't that easy to find in the world of enl inment luu's eyes were filled with confusion he looked around and as far as the eye could see the place was Barren and Silent this is a place where human martial arts Masters have never set foot no perhaps there are some amazing martial arts Masters who came here but did not find A New Path and all returned without success this instant even luu has lost his confidence can he really find A New Path or does that New Path really exist if it couldn't be found or if it didn't exist at all then the medicinal power of the tiue diffracting Dharma pill would have been consumed for nothing this is a ninth order Immortal Elixir no there must be a new path keep looking you're bound to find it after a short period of hesitation luu was again firm in his beliefs trusting in his own premonitions and continued to search in the wilderness of this da I don't know how much time has passed but I still haven't found at this moment luu's body pish janun Stone blo shimmering light brought a trace of luck luu's eyes lit up what did he see not far ahead there really seems to be a new road without hesitation luu traveled through The Lonesome Wilderness constantly searching for the New Path it's not an illusion there's no mistaking it he found it a new unprecedented path of martial arts luu violently opened his eyes in this instant the entire reverse entropy Mystic realm shook slightly the magnitude of this vibration was so unremarkable that no one could have noticed it aside from the manipulator behind the Heaven's Pride battle the reverse entropy Envoy and the Marshall St Lu Chang Shen within the reverse entropy Mysteries an extremely special place the black robe reverse entropy Envoy suddenly sensed something and fiercely widened his eyes directly standing up and looking into the distance in shock gazing at that piece of emptiness ha li Chong xong who was on the side also Ed a hint of something wrong he narrowed his eyes slightly that's the ocean of rules Roars it's the vibration of the ocean of rules that caused the entire secret realm to shake who in this session of the heavens Pride battle there is such an amazing talent that has triggered the Resonance of the ocean of rules this is realizing a trace of the power of the origin laws Lu Chang Chang said with some surprise even he was was very surprised in this Heavens Pride battle they were all fifth realm Heavens Pride if they could realized the domain of the seventh realm to a great extent they were already magnificent now

he's actually penetrated the rules of the eighth realm mastered a trace of the power of the laws of origin what a joke it's too anticlimactic no the black robe reverse entropy Envoy shook his head and said with a grave expression on his face honestly speaking even if there was a fifth realm extreme Heavenly Pride who had realized a trace of the power of the origin laws it would not be possible to induce such resonance in the ocean of rules the movement is not right hearing this Lu Chang Chang quickly reacted as he nodded and said if according to you which genius should this be who has found a new path to win the cheering boil of the of rules I think that should be the case the black robe reverse entropy onvoy nodded finding a new path is just as counterintuitive as realizing a trace of the power of the origin laws if not a bit more so let's go go see who that heaven defying fellow is Lu chaning couldn't wait good the black robe reverse entropy Envoy nodded the duo searched in the direction of the rule ocean resonance and soon found from The Source surprisingly little luu looking at the quiet room that had caused a great commotion not far away and at luu who was in the process of comprehending the New Path Lu chaning couldn't help but blink his eyes dismay written all over his face it's actually him the reverse entropy Envoy was also startled whether it was Lu Chang Chang were the reverse entropy onvoy neither of them expected that Lu you would find A New Path Lu Chong xong who was still a bit worried turned into Elation at this moment as he stared at luu with dead eyes his eyes filled with admiration this new path is the path after the nine turns of the golden body is that a golden Elixir similar to the cultivation method a few reincarnations ago no this isn't the same path it's a martial arts Gan danan just by gazing at it Lu Chang Shang came to a realization and he sced in amazement so that's how it is so that's how it is above the golden body practicing the way of Wuda Jinan directly bypassing the Dharma body this is a purely physical path pursuing the ultimate in martial arts it just happens to articulate the way of Flesh becomes sainthood it's so beautiful and perfect praising one after another Lu chaning suddenly turned his head to look at the reverse entropy Envoy now what do you think of this son of mine reverse entropy makes he was silenced by the above the nine Revolutions of the golden body there is indeed A New Path inside luu's body a golden Dan was slowly condensing it was completely different from the legendary Immortal cultivators Gan it's a golden pill of martial arts it is not the case that the system is different and then a different name is given to it and the soup is changed actually the two are diametrically opposed in nature the Marshall golden Dan cultivates the physical body The Immortal cultivation Ganan on the other hand cultivates law there is no difference between the two just two completely different paths in the blink of an eye it was a day inside luu's body this golden pill of Marshall Arts was completely solidified on the Marshall Dow golden pill countless tiny inscriptions as if they were complicated patterns were engraved on it adding an extremely mysterious feeling to this Marshall da golden pill Marshall daan realm this is a brand new path a path that is more suitable for me luu slowly opened his eyes the corners of his mouth revealed a faint smile I wonder what my current strength is actually how how many more chances of Victory are there against that domain eighth Heavenly Pride I can no longer estimate the only way to know is after the battle just then a prompt suddenly appeared in front of luu's eyes the fourth level of the 10,000 Clans heavens Pride battle is about to begin so please have all the players rush to the fourth level Battlefield as soon as possible luu stood up a faint smile on his face just in time three short days could be considered extraordinarily torturous for the audience of the 10,000 races the later the stage the more exciting the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle would become the fourth level had not even begun yet and the audience of the 10,000 races of the universe had already argued countless times and clamored even though the pride of most of the Clans had already been eliminated it didn't stop them from continuing to watch the match to see who would actually be able to ascend to the first place of the cosmic 10,000 Clans Pride of the heavens finally in anxious waiting the fourth level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle kicked off chapter 194 the 16 battle begins brush luu suddenly appeared in the dueling field of the fourth level immediately a pair of eyes looked over he's coming the little Marshall saint of the human race let's hope the weight is a little more lucky and we don't draw these early advancement guys it's only been a few days since I've seen him how do you feel he's a little different it's a little different it's only been a few days could it have gotten stronger it can't B can it Captain Wy trotted over and then introduced him to this side of the situation the random draw will be taking place soon after the draw the eight matches will be played against each other in succession to directly determine the top eight spots after the top eight spots are determined another random draw will be held for four matches to directly determine the top four that means

a total of 12 games will be played before and after and this is today's tournament schedule come tomorrow there are only three matches two of the 4 and two and one of the twoin one final this fourth level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle the full results will be decided in two days I have to say the pace is really fast the draw is about to begin so fast luu followed wuu Gaz not far away right above the huge ring a line of text was suspended drawing of lots in progress the results of the draw for the round of 16 are as follows battle one ktie the elf versus yuu on the Holy Spirit battle two sunclan Destiny versus tyin Clan shuu battle three blood moon Clan robbery versus human Clan Wu battle four chaos an Clan tyu versus nine specters to Shan battle five luu of the human race versus schu of the star feather race battle six oz of the star God Clan versus yanting of the red dragon Clan battle seven Karen of the beaching Clan versus Kaman of the golden Clan battle eight Union of the cloud-wing clan versus Lucy of the siren Clan as soon as the list was in announced many Heavenly Prides reacted differently woia couldn't help but stare what kind of luck am I having the battle of the top 16 his chances of winning would have been very low the result was also a robbery by the blood moon Clan this guy it was said that he had already mastered the eighth level of the domain how's this for a fight there is no doubt that the odds of winning are infinitely close to zero equally unlucky as him was the Heavenly fate of the sun race Celestial Destiny couldn't help but frown it's almost like a showdown of Destiny he actually let him face the tyin clan shua right off the bat if this was lost the consequences were simply unimaginable and there would inevitably be a wave of curses within the sun Community but the problem was it was said that sukuya had already mastered the eth realm and was far above him in strength it's not really a good fight Celestial Destiny raised his head as if he wanted to see through the layers of space to see the person behind the scenes who was presiding over this Heaven's Pride battle he wondered if this was deliberately arranged how else could it be so coincidental star feather Clan snowmoon luu saw this name and immediately searched for it a tall young girl was soon seen she wore a silvert trimmed white robe her attire simple and dignified and the surface of her body seemed to be surrounded by clouds revealing vulgarity and nobility everywhere at this moment she was also sizing up luu eyes locked schu's slender eyebrows were gently raised and her almond eyes were clear and bright as if they could penetrate the heart even against luu he did not have the slightest fear and appeared except ceptionally calm and collected this star feather Clan Shu was at the peak of the sixth level of the realm just one step away from the seventh level of the realm with this kind of strength if he had more luck he might have killed his way to the top eight but unfortunately she met luu it was still luu who had just broken through to the Marshall golden Dan when the results of the draw for the round of 16 battle were announced many Heavenly Prides were observing their competitors the smell of gunpowder instantly intensified in The Invisible Clash of eyes soon the first battle has begun one up uan of the Holy Spirit Clan then opened his domain in full the terrifying field of Darkness quickly took over the vast majority of the Ring densely densely packed like ghosts escaping from the marrow hell they madly pounced towards the elf ktie there was hardly any suspense but after a few rounds yuyuan eliminated the elf Clan's Pride Katie from the tournament outside the ring so strong is this the domain great success such a disparity caused the hearts of wooi to Shan yenting and the other Celestial Pride to sink was the gap between them and the the absolute Heavenly Pride who had skipped the second and third hurdles actually so great soon the Second Battle began this battle was also one of the most exciting battles in this top 16 battle the sun Clan's absolute Heavenly Pride at the peak of the seventh level of the domain faced off against the tyin Clan's absolute Heavenly Pride at the eighth level of the domain to sakuya the eighth level of the domain certainly held a great Advantage but if you take it lightly and think you're going to win there's a real chance you'll roll over so sukuya fought seriously the ring the ultimate duel between onein and one Yang was an eye-opening experience for all the Heavenly Prides as well as for the audience of all the races in the universe eventually it was still the domain H shuu who was even better and managed to make it to the top eight this matchup is over in the third battle it was was the blood moon Clans hijack who faced off against the human Clans wooy the difference between the two sides is a little too great the former was the eighth level of the domain the latter on the other hand was at the fifth level of the domain it's almost a Surefire battle nevertheless wuu say still quickly adjusted his State then it was even more comfortable to rush to the battlefield even if it's 10 deaths there's no chance of winning however as a human martial artist he still had to fight his way out and absolutely could not lose face as soon as he came

up wooo sat opened his domains fully and took the initiative to attack the way of the martial artist is like this even if the enemy is strong one must still go forward hijack looked at woi with some surprise then smiled faintly Moths To The Flame there was no suspense in this battle and there were no Miracles it's not as if the intention is strong enough to reverse everything winning with weakness happens from time to time but it's ultimately a minority of a minority when Wu waia was eliminated from the tournament luu furrowed his brows and subconsciously glanced at hijack he didn't even take it seriously and one as if was playing the eighth level of the domain was truly extraordinary sensing luu's attention hijack immediately looked over and said indifferently don't be in a hurry next it's your turn not buddy I haven't even said a word why are you initiating the taunting the absolute Pride of the blood moon plan the champion seed of the eighth level of the domain how can he have such a pattern luu was a bit speechless he felt like the protagonist in a story talk book how come no matter where he went there were villains jumping out to taunt him these villains it's like they have no brains but on second thought that's not true either the reason for hijacks Outburst of mockery was simple it was because luu was a human and the relationship between the blood moon Clan and the human Clans could be described is very poor although hijack had just eliminated a marshall Invincible he was only at the fifth level of the domain so he really didn't have any sense of accomplishment much less something to brag about so he came to speak to luu the son of the Marshall Sage about eliminating him from the tournament chapter 195 one sword chop the battle of the elite Aid begins in the face of hijacks provocation luu smiled talking trash he hasn't been afraid of anyone yet then you'll have to wash your neck and wait for me luu lifted the long sword in his hand and said indifferently wash up properly before letting me chop off your dog's head at these words hijack froze for a moment and he narrowed his eyes but did not argue with luu at least it was a supreme Heavenly Pride of the eighth level of the domain it was not wise to quarrel with a human child it's humiliating to win an argument and even more humiliating to lose one soon the fourth battle began chaos ancient Clan versus nine specters Clan these two civilization groups both belong to the kind of very old and Powerful groups both in terms of strength and Heritage were quite terrifying however the stand of this terms nine specters Clan's Heavenly Pride was clearly not very good this two Shan of the nine specters Clan who was only at the peak of the fifth level of the realm against taisu of the seventh level of the realm it was a battle with almost no suspense this is actually normal a supreme Heavenly Pride that could comprehend a domain that could only be mastered at the seventh realm to Great completion during the fifth realm period a civilized Community would often only be able to produce one in a 100 years if you're unlucky it can even take hundreds of years for one to come out some weak Clans medium Clans it would take thousands of years or even tens of thousands of years for such a supreme Heavenly Pride to appear with tyu winning the battle easily the fifth battle was human race luu versus Star feather race snowmoon before the battle even started many Heavenly Prides looked over they were all curious but it had only been a few short days had luu gotten a little stronger again the moment human communities ever since wuu siia was eliminated only luu was left with this hope of advancing if he was eliminated again he would have to fight for the ninth and 10th and it was still unknown whether he could get the flame of civilization or not contrary to that but if you can win this one and make it to the top eight you can take a strand of the flame of civilization can we win with countless pairs of eyes watching the battle was imminent the star feather race was a neutral race in the universe never participating in the wars of the various races and the relationship with humans was not considered good but not too bad either at this moment this tall and tall with a temperament close to Perfection the star feather Clan's Heavenly Pride Shu looked at luu who had stepped onto the ring and revealed a faint smile which was warm and genial calming one's state of mind she said softly little brother my sister is afraid of pain you have to be more more gentle next okay sister hearing this luu nodded and said I'll kill you with a single sword and I'll definitely give you a hard time snow Moon her face immediately turned somber the field of ice and snow instantly spread above the entire ring but the moment she was ready to attack she was surprised to find that luu had already disappeared in place so fast what about people alerted Yuki Yuki jerked her head around however her reaction time was too slow only once he turned around the perspective had already skyrocketed a nice beautiful head spinning up in midair a sword with just a single stroke of his sword luu chopped off snow Moon's head and ended the battle only when the luu wins prompt appeared did many of the celestial Pride wake up as if from a dream and then looked at luu with the eyes of a monster so fast is this the

end this is outrageous in this battle luu didn't show any undercard it was by virtue of hard power that he easily decapitated snowm mooon among the many Celestial Pride the only ones who could remain calm were those few Supreme Celestial pride in the in the meantime human communities all the spectators were staring at the scene in front of them their jaws dropped and they could not believe it for a moment it's over this was the fourth level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle the final battle of the top 16 no one who made it to this level was an instant favorite but even with such a Heavenly Pride luu still chopped it with a single sword after a short period of Silence the entire human community directly boiled over outside the secret realm of counter entropy sya gaan by yujing and the others could not help but stare wideeye at this scene in just a few days the captain has gotten stronger again a single sword kills the sixth level of the domain it's simply horrible as hell what ate pervert wait until the fifth game is played this sixth game again was not much of a contest o of the star Gods wins easily by the seventh and eighth battles there was always a bit of suspense these two battles were fought back and forth eventually in the seventh battle Karen of the beaching Clan won battle eight Lucy the siren wins when the game was over over Karen and Lucy Had Smiles written all over their faces it was a happy occasion and they even started celebrating early previously Fong Wang's expectation of luu was that the top four would be considered a success their Elders likewise expect the same of them even lower final four the final eight is considered a victory okay at this moment the goal had been achieved and he had successfully obtained a ray of civilization flame for his own tribe so what was there not to be satisfied with the latter race is so difficult that it doesn't matter much to them anymore to this point the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle entered the final eth stage just a little break soon the draw for the second round has begun almost all of the Heaven's Pride held their breath unlike the first round of draws in this second round the draw for the final eight the only players with weak strengths were Karen of the beaching Clan and Lucy of the siren Clan whoever draws both of them will be lucky in fact Karen and Lucy were mentally praying to draw each other in doing so they had a glimmer of hope of making it to the quarterfinal stage but their there comes a time when luck runs out the draw for the second round came out quickly the results of the draw for the eighth round are as follows Dash battle one luu of the human race versus yuyuan of the Holy Spirit race battle two Karen of the beaching Clan versus shuu of the tyin clan battle three oz of the star God Clan versus hijacking of the blood moon Clan battle four Lucy of the sirens versus tyu of the chaos ancients seeing this result yuyuan of the Holy Spirit Clan's face could not be seen to be happy or angry he turned his head and said quietly I said I'd see you at the fourth level before but I didn't think I'd actually run into you luu smiled and asked scared when these words came out Yu yuan's brows furrowed as he smiled and said I have to admit in just a few days you've improved quite a bit easily defeating the peak of the sixth level of the domain but what I'm trying to tell you is Dash the gap between you and a domain D Chang is not something you can catch up with in a short period of time domain D Chang it's definitely not as simple as you think Lu you waved his hand interrupting his boasting it's not like I haven't killed a domain 7 that's just bullying a who just broke through the seventh level Yu you UNG grunted but it's better to see the real thing in the ring just fight and you'll know the result I hope your mouth will still be this hard when the time comes Lu you laughed I'll return this word as it is you mustn't become mute when you're about to lose chapter 196 fuel on the fire who restrained who just as the Elite 8 is about to begin above the ring a black robed Powerhouse suddenly appeared his appearance out of thin air caused many Heavenly Prides to freeze even luu who was in the middle of trash talking was stunned the black robe Powerhouse looked down at the eight Heavenly Prides on the scene smiled faintly and opened his mouth to greet them gentlemen I am the presiding officer behind the 10,000 Clans heavens Pride battle the reverse entropy Envoy when these words came out all the celestial Pride revealed a look of surprise not expecting the reverse entropy Envoy to show up in the past 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle the reverse entropy Envoy did not show up every time a 100 times in the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle only one or two times might come out every time he shows up he has his his purpose may bring new changes fruity the black robe reverse entropy Envoy said with a smile we've now entered the final e stage and in the next three rounds of the competition the number one of the 10,000 races Heavenly Pride will be decided I have specially appeared at this moment to tell you good news this time for the 10,000 Clans Heavenly Pride I will as far as my authority allows raise the civilization flame that the

champion receives to the largest strand ever it's worth noting that only the champion can have this honor as for the other rankings of the civilization fire it Remains the Same as usual this greatest wisp of civilization's flame I believe you should be able to clearly understand the gold behind it whether it's for the clan behind you or for yourselves it can be a great benefit the moment these words came out the eight Heavenly Prides on the scene all brightened up there was no doubt that these words from the reverse entropy Envoy were equivalent to adding fuel to the fire it made an already pirate Technic atmosphere even more intense when this news spread out through the live broadcast it also caused the 10,000 rac's audience to argue and discuss the largest flame of civilization ever my God I didn't expect the gold content of this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle to be so high take the crown it has to be a championship our tying Clan shuu is at the eighth level of the domain there's a lot of hope this is our blood moon Clan's chance hijack will definitely be able to take the title little Marshall Saint definitely has a chance to win the title believe in him he will definitely be able to create a miracle under the expectant gaze of the audience of the 10,000 races of the universe the first battle of the Elite 8 is about to begin luu and yuyuan both stepped onto the ring after the reverse entropy and voice incitement the atmosphere was completely ignited but the duo and the ring were still quite calm your human race is Despicable so I will be careful and careful again you Yuan looked at luu and spoke indifferently you don't need to think about winning by those gimmicks it's futle at this stage the only thing that matters is true strength he said this just by reaching out and lifting his hand the entire domain was transformed into a dark Battlefield within the domain the light disappeared completely and utterly it was a dead blackness he quickly blended into this darkness and disappeared completely F Shu Shu Sho Shu in the dark field countless ghostly Shadows from all directions pounced towards luu each ghostly Shadow possessed extremely powerful strength and if an ordinary strong person was entangled in close proximity he was afraid that he would be torn into pieces in minutes because of the special nature of the heavens Pride Battle Ring although L you couldn't see anything the heavens Pride outside as well as the spectators of the 10,000 races of the universe were able to clearly see this image seeing this scene many of the human race Spectators could not help but exclaim in shock this was the Holy Spirit Clan yuan's domain killing move 10,000 ghosts walking at night above the ring luu Advanced without retreating and swung his sword pul returned to the ruins the sword light blossomed like countless streams of light instantly tearing apart hundreds of ghostly Shadows these ghostly Shadows however seemed to possess the undead trait the moment they were chopped up by luu's sword light they quickly fused and transformed into new ghostly Shadows that continued to pounce and even some of the ghost ghostly Shadows absorbed the might of that sword light and became even more ferocious this sword return to ruin was already terrifying enough in its power luu is even used to pure fire to the state of perfection it was enough to fight against domain deang but Yu yuan's Maro ghost prison seemed to be somewhat restraining luu even if the sword light stirred up more ghostly Shadows they still resurrected there's no end to the killing there's no end to the killing this scene caused the faces of many human Spectators to change slightly and a trace of an unpleasant premonition arose in their hearts The Spectators of the Holy Spirit tribe on the other hand were all invigorated when they saw this scene yes Yu yuan's domain just happens to restrain this luu just wear him down steadily and you'll win right absolutely no close combat haha there's a good chance of winning nope how is he still so calm yeah why can you be so calm in the eyes of all the spectators Lu you walks in this sun Lua ghost prison as if walking leisurely appearing exceptionally calm a sword returned to the ruins of The Chopping out see the effect is not big he will once again raise the long sword in his hand this sword was named chopping evil in an instant the sword bloomed with dazzling light like a brilliant sun countless channels of golden light quickly formed a Golden Chain piercing through the ghostly shadows and fixing them all in place unable to move in the darkness Yu yuan's figure appeared and his face changed vigorously what kind of Sword move is this he could clearly feel that under the illumination of this round of brilliant sun the entire realm was affected in some way true enough luu raised his head and looked at yuyuan in midair in the distance murmuring softly this sword of mine the evil beheading specializes in restraining this type of domain of yours it's really unlucky for you to meet me after a long time using this sword to cut down evil Again luu's Play was obviously quite a bit better than the last time afterward luu did not hesitate and directly swung his sword kill the evil a round of brilliant sun directly smashed over in an instant neither the ghostly Shadows nor the maral ghostly prison could stop this great sun in the slightest like snow being melted the ghosts and shadows quickly turned into a puddle of black water and and then even more directly evaporated restraint thoroughly restrained in the corner of the Ring Yu yuan's face

was incomparably ugly as he desperately maneuvered his domain and frantically resisted this great sun it's like water against fire barely bared the incomparably Intense Collision constantly produced a numbing sound the Maro ghost prison and this round of brilliant sun frantically sparring against each other to consume under the constant sparring in consumption in the end it was the eight-fold domain s luo ghost prison that was Superior the fields were all mostly shredded but a win is a win yuyuan was overjoyed haaha nothing more than that this great round of your son is nothing more than that yuyuan laughed openly and maniacally but when he raised his head is jaw dropped and he was dumbfounded however he saw luu not far away lifting The Sword in his hand and above that sword there were nine rounds of brilliant Suns one round of big sun doesn't work then nine more rounds yuu on chapter 197 crushing stance advancing to the final four nine rounds of brilliant sun Shone throughout the ring yuyuan opened his mouth as a sense of powerlessness came over him he completely did not expect that after he desperately used the moral ghost prison to cancel out a round of great Suns the opposite side had once again condensed great Suns and there was more than one it was directly nine rounds of great Suns beat the out of him yuyuan was directly numb for a moment he broke his defenses a bit originally he was still thinking that his Moro ghost prison just restrained luu's way of Flesh without a domain thinking that he should be able to win this battle easily things started out in that direction as well as long as L you can't find him consumption can also consume luu to death who knew that luu would backhandedly use a sword technique that restrained him how can this be fun as expected of a supreme Heavenly Pride of the seventh level of the domain to be able to withstand the might of this round of my great son luu couldn't help but sigh in admiration as he looked at The Wretched yuyuan hearing these words Yu yuan's face instantly stiffened where was this praising him it was clearly humiliating him such praise was more difficult for him than outright insults it's just to kill and to put to death seeing that Yu Yuan didn't reply either and really became mute Lu you felt bored he had said it all before never become mute when you're about to lose it's kind of an early shot in the arm but it was clear that yuyuan didn't look like he was listening at this moment he probably didn't even think that his defeat came from a gap in strength rather he felt that luu's sword which was used to cut down evil just happened to restrain him and that was why he ended up in such a situation but the problem was that luu's bottom card his Marshall golden pill hadn't been utilized until now but luu naturally wouldn't use his bottom card just to make you Yuan lose he couldn't do such a stupid thing now try again to see if you can resist these nine Great sons at the same time luu said indifferently then chopped down with a sword boom nine Great sons smashed down carrying the energy of destroying everything and Yu yuan's domain was instantly completely torn apart ceasing to exist completely luu Victory successful in the quarterfinals after taking the match luu quickly steps out of the ring the gazes of many Celestial Pride were almost all placed on his body congratulations on defeating you youan so easily when Lu walked down the tyin clan shuu suddenly opened her mouth thanks a lot luu was slightly stunned not expecting this shuu to suddenly speak to himself in fact he didn't take the victory to heart this yuyuan wasn't particularly strong and he wasn't even able to force out his own bottom card it was too easy a win to even feel a sense of accomplishment there is of course restraint but even without restraint luu is also sure to win a crushing Victory into the final four little Marshall Saint is in the top four that's too much momentum is there really a chance to win the championship before the opening of the top 16 battle most of the audience's expectation of luu was that it would be enough to take a ray of the flame of civilization and as for Something Like A Champion it was just too far away however when luu killed the star feather Clan's Heavenly Pride snow moon with a single sword strike a bold thought was born in the hearts of all the tribal spectators at this moment the idea of beheading the Holy Spirit Race's Supreme Heavenly Pride again was even more intense so far luu had killed his way into the quarterfinals so the championship is it still far away there's a real chance next just win two more fights in tomorrow's battle but all viewers are well aware of how difficult it is to win the title shuu of the tyin clan as well as hijack of the blood moon Clan were both existences that the eighth level of the realm it's so hard to win didn't you just restrain luu how did you suddenly get restrained despicable this luu is also too despicable at this moment when the spectators of the Holy Spirit Clan saw the scene each and every one of them was a little heartbroken screaming about the unfairness of this duel amidst all the discussion the second match of the Elite 8 began Karen of the beaching Clan versus Saku Yuki of the tyin clan without any suspense the tyin clan Shu easily won in the third and fourth games hijack and tyu won successively at this point all of the top four spots are

out human luu tyin Clan Solstice blood moon Clan hijacking chaos ancient Clan tyu and that's the end of today's game we'll have to wait until tomorrow to to determine the final winner among the top four players in terms of paper strength shuu and hijack were a bit stronger both being at the eighth level of the domain tyu wasn't too bad at the peak of the seventh level of the domain only half a step away from breaking through to the eighth level of the domain only luu on paper was a bit off however his body was extremely terrifying and his ability to fight in close combat was even more frightening to everyone to this point there isn't a weakling left in the final four the 10,000 races Heavens Pride battle came to an abrupt end and The Spectators of the 10,000 races of the universe could be tickled to death for a while and many of them even lost sleep as a result the major online forums were also a bloody mess for many this is the moment of Reckoning before this many people didn't think highly of luu thinking that he was at most a top eight Powerhouse and if he was unlucky enough to encounter an absolute Heavenly Pride right off the bat he might not even make it into the top eight although there is not much basis but still analyze the head no reason to say a three that's normal there is always a shortage of people on the internet who like to go against the grain and gain attention as a result now that luu had easily killed his way into the quarterfinals these posts were naturally dug up and flawed below that is a clear question mark and all sorts of flirtatious remarks owner all eyes on me I'm a sand pen don't play dead owner come out and get beaten come out and bark again and listen in addition to the liquidation there were various discussions who will win the ultimate championship and what will happen when the final four are drawn tyin Clan shuu blood moon Clan hijack chaos ancient clan tyu of these three absolute Heavenly Prides tyu strength was a bit on the weak side if luu could draw him it would obviously be the best outcome however with only a one-third probability it's unlikely and even if you're lucky in dra taisu you'll still end up having to face either hijack or sukuya if you want to win the title then you have to beat them head-on in the middle of the quiet room for tomorrow's game luu did not slacken off in the slightest and continued his Enlightenment cultivation this martial arts path of ginan although the most suitable path for luu so that his current strength enhanced by more than a little bit but ultimately it is a well less than perfect path there are still many things that need to be perfected by luu the founder most things that is when there are advantages there are disadvantages and it is impossible to just take the benefits and not be responsible since it takes a path that no one has traveled before being the first to eat the crab it managed to resonate with the ocean of rules and thanks to that it skyrocketed in strength then accordingly he would be responsible for perfecting this Marshall golden Dan path chapter 198 Lucky Draw kill the final discovering a brand new path is hard perfecting a road is even more difficult good on luu is open for business with the help of the tiue immortal cells and the tiue defra of Dharma pill it was generally quite smooth in the blink of an eye a day had passed on the second day after the prompts appeared before his eyes luu did not hesitate for a second and rushed to the fourth level of the dueling field the semi-finals haven't even started yet all the races of the Universe on countless living planets The Spectators of different races almost coincidentally looked over the broadcast started long ago and the hosts are analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the top four contestants And discussing who will win the final championship human communities countless viewers have opened the live broadcast seeing that those few hosts are still bullshitting they can't help but spit out finished hurry up and start ah I'm in a hurry in the heroes of dashia chat group it's about to start the semi-finals of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle are about to begin coming coming finally I was up all last night waiting for today's game me too so excited I can't sleep at all big brother is just too Fierce the fourth level of the dueling field brush Lou you appeared here in this empty space there were now only four Heavens Pride he still remembered that not long ago the participants of the 10,000 races of the universe a full 100,000 or so Heavenly Prides we mixing it up on the final Battlefield of the first level and it was a hilarious sight now after several rounds of elimination only four Heavenly Prides remained and today is the final showdown from within these four Heavenly Prides the ultimate Victor will be decided who gets the last laugh luu or is it Saku Yuki or maybe hijacking taso soon above the ring the draw begins the results of the semi-final draw are as follows Dash battle one tyin clan shuu versus blood moon Clans hijacking battle two luu of the human race versus tyu of the chaos ancient race as soon as the results of the draw came out the blood moon Clan's absolute Pride hijack immediately widened his eyes and immediately shouted it's not fair it's not fair what makes two strong ones draw together in two weak ones as soon as these words came out the chaos ancient racist

Tiu immediately furrowed his brows and asked with some dissatisfaction, "What do you mean by letting the two weaker ones be drawn together?"

Hijack said lightly, "I didn't say who was strong and who was weak. You brought it up automatically, so how can you blame me?"

The reasoning was really this, though he didn't want to admit it, but he did feel that drawing Luu was the best result. Those two Domain Eights were clearly stronger, but the direct point still irked him. He didn't want to lose face, but the Blood Moon Clan's robbery was unforgiving. He glanced coldly at Tiu and then at Luu, saying, "Count yourselves both lucky. I can't help but laugh at the thought of one of you two mixing it up for the finals, but this is your last luck. It's only a runner-up; there's no way to win the championship. Enjoy this last luck."

When Luu heard these words, he spoke directly, "Are you in a hurry because you're afraid you won't win and won't make it to the finals?"

Taisu also spoke up, "Haha, I think that's it." As these words came out, Hijack instantly turned his head to look at Luu. "I just think that the strongest battle should be placed in the finals, don't you think so?" "The final is not the strongest battle, and I'm afraid the audience of all the races in the universe are not enjoying themselves enough," he said, adding, "Unfortunately, your luck is too good."

Luu narrowed his eyes and said lightly, "I said before, I hope you can wash your neck and wait for me. Don't even get in the finals; that would be a pity. Haha." Hearing this, the robbery couldn't help but laugh. "You're going into the finals first with that," he said, turning his head away and getting into the ring.

Little brother, I will help you," Sukuya suddenly spoke when the draw for the semi-finals came out. The 10,000 races were seething, and the human community cheered even more. The best draws were out with a one-third probability. It really let Luu draw a winner; that's luck, that's really good. It's not a good thing to underestimate your opponent, though. However, it was undeniable that the Chaos Ancient Clans, Tiu, was the best to solve. But to win the title, luck alone is clearly not enough. Even if they squeak into the finals, they'll still end up having to face one of Hijack and Sukuya.

The first battle of the semi-final started soon after. It was a very good fight, no doubt about it. Shuu's Domain Mirror Flower Water Moon and the Robbers' Domain Five Elements Mirage Realm were constantly colliding, and they were on par with each other for a while. The Domain broke through to the seventh level, and each level after that was a Heavenly barrier: Seventh Weight Domain Great Fulfillment, Eighth Level the Summit, Ninth the World Takes Shape. Even though the Chaos Ancient Racist Tiu was only half a step away from breaking through to the Eighth Level of the Realm, this half step made him feel a wave of despair. The difference was too great. Fortunately, fortunately, his opponent was Luu. However, even if one could win against Luu, what should one do against these two opponents? The championship was still out of reach unless he could break through to the Eighth Level as well. Thinking like this, Tiu hungrily watched the battle between the two supreme celestials, trying to draw inspiration from their domains and find a direction to break through to the Eighth Level of Gravity.

The two sides fought for a full hour, and in the end, Hijack was superior and managed to defeat the Tyin Clan Shuu, killing him in the finals. So it seems that this guy is so arrogant; he still has arrogant capital in the original timeline. He might have been the champion of this Heaven Pride battle. Soon, the Second Battle began. In this battle, Luu still didn't reveal his bottom card, so he fought with a slight struggle. But in the end, he still won. At the last moment of the battle, Luu could clearly feel that his opponent had had an epiphany and was about to make a breakthrough. Originally, Tiu was already at the peak of the Seventh Level of the Domain and was still close to breaking through to the Eighth Level. After watching the peak duel between Hijack and Sukuya, there were some epiphanies. If Luu gave him some time, he might really be able to make a breakthrough in battle. But Luu didn't give him that chance. The moment he was about to break through, he was directly decapitated.

After Tiu was eliminated from the game, he was late, even though he still broke through to the Eighth Level of the Domain. "Damn it, what's to stop me from breaking through once? Once I break through, I'm sure I'll make it to the finals." Tiu clenched his teeth in dismay. Clearly on the verge of a breakthrough, but he fell before the final. If he managed to break through and win against Luu, then he didn't have a chance in the final. His Kingdom of Mixed Elements was considered a type of domain more restrained against Hijack's Five Elements Illusion Realm. Damn human brat, Tiu was furious. For a moment, what's the point of losing to Hijack when you eliminated me? You still have a grudge against him. Might as well let me win. I'd like to take a good look at how you lost.

Chapter 9: The Strongest Matchup, the Battle at the Top 10,000 Clans, Heaven Pride Battle Level Four, the Final Showdown Arena. At this moment, there was only one person left below the ring: the Blood Moon Clan, Hijack.

Looking above the ring in Surprise, he couldn't help but let out a loud laugh, "Hahaha!" When Tyu was about to break through to the eighth level of the domain, Hijack admitted that he was slightly flustered. Ty's country of mixed elements had just restrained his own five elements illusionary realm. Previously, it was a simple tear-off, so it wasn't tricky yet. However, if he broke through to the eighth level of the domain, even if it was just a breakthrough, he would still be extremely difficult to deal with. This stumbling block, which should have been on the way to winning the title, was surprisingly eliminated by Luu at this moment. How could he not laugh out loud?

His original thought was that he hoped Luu would beat some sense into Tyu and remove some obstacles for himself, but of course, winning would be even better. Who knew that it would really give Ta Su an elimination and also eliminate him when he was about to break through to the eighth level of the domain? This really made Hijack a little tense. "Good, good, good! It seems that destiny is mine. The champion of this 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle should rightfully belong to me!" For a moment, Hijack laughed uncontrollably, laughing with abandon and almost popping champagne at halftime. After all, in his opinion, a Tyu who had broken through to the eighth level of the domain and also happened to be restrained was obviously much more tricky. Even if Luu was indeed a nuisance, relatively speaking, he was much, much better.

Above the ring, Luu, who had just eliminated Taisu, couldn't help but be slightly stunned when he saw that Hijack was actually smiling so happily. Of course, he couldn't possibly be happy about the fact that he had made it into the finals. Rather, he felt that he had eliminated a formidable foe and felt that the champion of the Heavens Pride battle was already within reach, which was why he was so happy, almost celebrating early. "What a rampant guy! This is the character of Hijack. This is true no matter when facing any opponent, but he does have the arrogance to be arrogant." If Luu hadn't broken through to the Marshall Dajin Dam realm, there really wasn't any way to take him. As for now, the winner was still unknown. Just a simple rest. The 10,000 races Heaven's Pride battle, the final showdown was about to begin.

Just then, the Reverse Entropy Envoy appeared above the ring for the second time. He lowered his head as if he was looking at you or as if he was looking at Hijack or as if he was looking at the audience of all the races in the universe. He then gently raised his palm, and the scene around him quickly changed. The original simple ring quickly expanded and turned into a floating island. Beyond the floating island, there was actually a cosmic vacuum. The entire floating island was wrapped in a special energy. This was the site of the final showdown. As soon as you fell off the floating island, you were sucked into the cosmic vacuum and automatically eliminated.

The Reverse Entropy Envoy spoke out to explain, and then his voice became slightly louder, appearing impassioned. "Next, the final duel of this 10,000 races Heaven's Pride battle is about to begin! This battle will determine the ownership of the largest strand of civilization's flame. This ray of civilization is more than the second through tenth places combined. It belongs to the ultimate winner, the ultimate winner of this great world struggle. Whether it's the robber from the Blood Moon Clan or Luu from the Human Clan, their strengths are both extremely outstanding. In the past, they would have had a chance to get the champion of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle, but even so, only one of them could have laughed in the end. Alright, I'll cut the crap. The strongest duel of this Cosmic 10,000 racist Heavens Pride battle will begin immediately!"

As soon as the words fell, the Reverse Entropy Envoy made it disappear into thin air. On top of the empty floating island, only Luu and Hijack remained. Without the slightest hesitation, Hijack directly opened his domain, the five elements of Illusion. In an instant, the floating island transformed into a normal world scene. Hijack's ambition was great, and the five elements of Illusion in fact represented the five rule attributes. He attempted to use this to break through the way of the world and make the illusion real. After the domain's great accomplishment, Hijack painstakingly cultivated and broke through to the eighth level of the domain, which already had a little hint of the five elements World. However, we are not there yet, so we can only call it the five elements illusionary realm for the time being.

"Welcome to my world," Hijack smiled faintly. He who was about to walk towards the championship looked courteous and polite, and at this moment, he was even in the mood to explain for Luu. "This five elements illusion of mine has five attributes: attack, gold, wood, water, fire, and Earth. However, among these five attributes, there are truths and falsehoods, so you need to screen them carefully."

Here is the rewritten text with improved English clarity and grammar only:

You should have been more careful in your screening, and yet, you didn't listen until the words were spoken. The body that had its head sliced off instantly exploded with a loud boom, and a mushroom cloud rose after the extremely violent explosion. The explosion was so extensive that it affected almost half of the floating island, and even Lu You was unable to dodge back and was caught in the wave. It didn't hurt, but being in the middle of an explosion was more than a little disorienting. After he regained his composure, the sound of crisp applause suddenly appeared behind him and soon became incredibly dense, like a mountain or a sea, coming straight at him. Your attack is really quite powerful, and one cannot help but feel that it would be more difficult to resist this.

However, it's time for me to get serious. Lu You turned around and instantly saw countless robbery attempts at a glance, with tens of thousands of them to count. They all raised their heads at the same time, looked at Lu You, and spoke in unison. This scene was extremely bizarre and spectacular, causing one to feel a chill run down their spine. At the realm of the eighth level of the domain, the number of robbery techniques and their power were indeed breathtaking. The tens of thousands of robbers looked at Lu You with a slight smile and asked, "Just now, one explosion couldn't solve you, but guess what kind of effect will there be if we all explode at the same time? Can you still resist?"

The terrifying explosion of tens of thousands of robbers was impossible for Lu You to withstand. "Okay, the explosion is going to start," the robbers laughed rampantly. Lu You, just about to retreat, suddenly felt a sudden urge and realized that he had been tricked into retreating to the edge of the cliff. If that was the case, it would be the end of everything. The tens of thousands of robbers saw that Lu You didn't take the bait and all of them showed regretful eyes, saying, "What a shame! What a pity!" to themselves.

"You've seen the power of the eighth level of the domain," Lu You suddenly spoke up. "No, I'm not admitting defeat," he shook his head slightly. At the same time, the tens of thousands of robbers laughed out loud, saying, "You still have the power to get serious, then?" However, the words "to get serious" were cut off before they were even finished. The tens of thousands of robbers looked at the scene in front of them in amazement as Lu You's body slowly flew out a golden pill, with countless complicated inscriptions sealed on it. At the moment, each inscription bloomed with a brilliant light, and when these rays of light shone over, they dispersed part of his five elements illusion treasure.

"No, this isn't a treasure at all," the robbers knitted their brows, sensing that the golden pill was extraordinary, and the inscriptions engraved on it were not part of the treasure, but rather something like the inscriptions on a Dharma body. However, it gave them a feeling that was diametrically opposite. "This is another path of cultivation," a guess was born in the robbers' minds. As a person who had cultivated the domain that could only be grasped by the seventh realm to the eighth level during the fifth realm period, Hik's cultivation talent was one of only a handful of existences in the entire scope of the universe. In just an instant, he could see some hint of what was to come, and guesses were more than eight or nine.

In the meantime, the human community was amazed at how the robber exerted his domain, fooling Lu You when he came up, and then almost tricking him out of the floating island. The gap between the two was clearly felt by all viewers. When facing the seventh level of the domain, Lu You still appeared to be at ease, with the advantage of his physical body, and fought steadily, eventually winning over his opponent and entering the final. However, when facing the eighth level of the domain, the gap between the two sides became significantly larger. Many spectators saw the scene and inevitably felt a wave of despair, thinking that Lu You's miracle might be coming to an end. However, just at that time, a sudden change occurred. Lu You, who had retreated to the edge of the cliff, suddenly had a golden bead appear inside his body, which was an indescribable and incomparably subtle golden pearl with countless tiny inscriptions engraved on it, blossoming with a radiant light that could actually dispel the five elements illusion of robbery.

All the human spectators couldn't help but stare with wide eyes and couldn't help but exclaim in shock. "What is that? What a trick!" Most of the ordinary spectators had not yet realized what was happening.

Truly noteworthy about this Marshall Dew Golden Pill was that some of the Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors watching the match on the other hand had detected the clues, each and every one of them couldn't help but furrow their brows as they stared at that Marshall Dew Golden Pill. "What's this? Not a treasure?" they thought. "The inscriptions are of a different nature; it's more like an inscription on the body of the Law's inscriptions on the body of the Law could it be that at this moment hundreds of Marshall Emperors in the human community were shaken all of them looking at Marshall Dew Golden Dan in the live broadcast screen in astonishment because they gradually realized what this Golden Dan really was. It represented a very different way of cultivation, a Marshall path that had never existed before for such a long time. How many amazingly talented martial arts Masters had explored the path of martial arts and had already thoroughly mapped out their cultivation all the way through? There was simply no such thing as A New Path. However, at this moment, 'Luu' was actually showing a new possibility. How could this not make people excited? The road was not yet perfect, but it was still stunning.

The Marshall Emperor stared at 'Luu' in the screen, and the shock they felt at the moment was hard to describe in words. This brand new cultivation path was it discovered by the Marshall Saint or did he discover it? If it was discovered by Marshall St 'Luu' Chang, then it was still within their range of acceptance. After all, Marshall Saints had created too many miracles, and it wasn't strange to discover another cultivation path. But what about 'Luu'? How old was he? It was only four years old this year. It was only three Realms before four. It was only by utilizing the special mechanism of the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle that he had broken through to the fifth realm, cultivating for just two years to discover a whole new way of cultivation. No way, absolutely not. This was a new cultivation system, outside of the reverse entropy Mystic realm. Fong Guang, the president of Blue Star University, couldn't help but stare, almost unable to believe his eyes. "Saya gan by Yujing, and the others on the side froze for a moment when they heard this. 'What did you say, Principal? This Golden Bead is a whole new way of cultivation. What, how is this possible?' Principal Fong Guang slowly nodded his head and said with a cautious expression on his face. If my guess is correct, what this Golden Bead represents is the Dharma body realm, after the Golden body realm. 'Luu' is taking a path, a different path of cultivation from the past.

Sword Emperor Xiao Wuan's residence, Xia Onean, who was watching the live broadcast, looked at the Marshall Dew Golden Pill and quickly reacted, "A new cultivation system! This is the cultivation system he discovered on his own." Xiao Jing, who was by the side, couldn't help but stare with wide eyes when he heard this. "Did you say, Dad? Xiao Wuan then pointed at the Golden Elixir and explained slightly, "This is the cultivation system discovered by Big Brother Xiao Jing." Xiao Jing blinked his eyes and asked with some disbelief, "Yes, he should be the one who discovered it." Xiao Wuan nodded slowly. Why couldn't it be 'Uncle' 'Luu' who found out? Xiao Jing subconsciously asked. Xia Onean's vision was so poisonous that he saw the many details at a glance and determined that it was 'Luu' who had created this cultivation path.

Confronting Xiao Jing, he gave an explanation: "The reason is simple. If it was discovered by 'Luu' then this road wouldn't be so simple, rudimentary. 'Xia Onean' was a bit surprised. He couldn't see anything rudimentary at all. It's too rudimentary, too rough. There are many imperfections. If it was with "Luu's" ability, once he discovers a new way of cultivation, he'll surely be able to quickly perfect it. But now this new cultivation path clearly has many flaws, so it must be 'Luu' who discovered this Golden Dan. Way. Saying this a faint smile appeared at the corner of Xia Onean's mouth: 'I didn't expect it. I really didn't expect it.' Originally, this final gap between the two sides was too hard for 'Luu' to win. But now the winners and losers are not yet known. A new way to practice above the floating island hijack knit his brows. The original face of calmness and self-confidence, the color of Victory quickly disappeared. What appeared instead was an incomparably grave look. Feel the tricky nature of that martial arts Golden Pill.

Hijek suddenly let out a loud laugh. Originally, I thought you were frail and insufficient, but I didn't expect you to give me such a big surprise. That's right. This final showdown of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle should be Sensational and exciting. Come, battle chapter 2011. The strongest moves duel. The wondrous use of the Marshall Golden Pill. The blood moon plants hijack is arrogant, cunning, cocky, and above board. He looked down on the vast majority of Heaven's Pride but as the topmost Heaven's Pride, he naturally did not lack that blood lust. At this moment, when he saw 'Luu' reveal his bottom card, after a short period of dismay, he was not surprised but pleased instead. His fighting spirit grew higher and higher. What about a brand new path of cultivation? The eighth level of the domain? The power of the peak could crush any opponent, whether it's Shuay of the Tyin tribe or 'Luu' of the human tribe. They are all just stepping stones for me. In an instant.

The Five Elements Illusion Realm subtly vibrated, invoking the power of Heaven and Earth, as if it were about to emerge from a separate dimension, hinting at the creation of reality from illusion. Witnessing this scene, powerful beings from various races across the universe could not help but marvel.

An eight-fold domain was about to manifest, subtly invoking the power of Heaven and Earth, ready to step out of the world's way. If he took the final step, we would be able to enter the ninth level of the domain. This was truly defying the heavens if he did. That battle was not a stroke of luck; it was strength. Even if it happened a hundred more times, the outcome would remain the same. That's strong, indeed.

The little Marshall Saint of the human race was also stepping onto a new path of cultivation. Both of them were rather anticlimactic. Before the Reverse Entropy Envoy spoke, I didn't realize that he had already foreseen it. Wonderful! This final showdown of the 10,000 Clans' Heaven Pride battle is truly wonderful. Luu couldn't help but smile as he felt the changes in the realm, which subtly had a hint of the flavor of the world compared to the Guardians of the ninth level of the Blue Star University's secret trial realm. This wasn't even a world; it was far from it.

The moment the light that blossomed after the Marshall's Golden Pill revealed its majesty, it formed a small world of its own. This was equivalent to a kind of mini domain that excluded hijacks, but it was completely different from ordinary domains. On this side of the small world, there was no special attack. Everything was Luu's main focus, allowing him to increase the full range of attributes. In contrast, it was similar to Wu Y's True Marshall Space, but this was just one of the changing natures.

Although Luu had gained a lot through the Resonance of the Ocean of Rules, there were still many imperfections. So far, he had only summarized three attacks. One, the Wuda Jinan power was externalized, forming a structure similar to a domain, which could counteract with the domain and not fall into the embarrassment of not having a domain. Two, use the Wuda Jinan as a weapon and directly smash people. There was no need to worry about damage to the Marshall's Golden Dan, as it was not the golden Dan of an immortal cultivator. Once it was damaged, there would be no source of power.

Three, the Ganan entered the abdomen, catalyzing the operation in the body, releasing the power of the martial arts Ganan to the greatest extent possible, and enhancing the attributes of speed, strength, defense, and so on to the greatest extent possible with the power of the Marshall's Golden Dan, the white Jade Wind and Fire swirled crazily under Luu's feet, and his speed increased significantly. He struck with the strongest sword, Paul, which returned to the ruins previously. In the battle against Yu Yuan sen luo ghost prison, this sword did not display too good an effect, but it did not mean that this sword was not powerful enough. It just happened that the domain effect restrained it.

At this moment in time, as the five elements illusion of the hijacker swung out a terrifying might, spread unchecked, even the eighth level of the domain was somewhat overwhelmed. One sword almost cut the entire field in half, churning up tens of thousands of robbers who offered no resistance, turning into bubbles without a trace.

Not bad for a sword. The shadow of the robber reappeared and he fatally commented before raising his arm in an instant. The world shook, and the attacks of the five attributes of gold, wood, water, fire, and Earth were all revealed. Among the countless attacks, there were illusions and real ones, smoke bombs and real master strokes. The dense L-packed attacks had completely locked Luu in place. He felt the attacks around him and knew clearly that this was the real deal. If he only relied on this imperfect Gan Dan domain, he definitely wouldn't be able to block this all-out strike without the slightest hesitation.

Luu immediately utilized the second attack of the Ganan smash. With just an extremely simple smash, the domain space shook, and even directly tore open a gap. Then, this golden Dan charged directly across the field, and the cracks in the field grew bigger and bigger and more and more, as if it wanted to stir up the robbers' field. These torn open fissures could not be recovered in a short period of time, and if they continued to tear wider, the entire field would be destroyed.

In this moment, it would be challenging to contain the ongoing rampage of Golden Dan, as the crack in the domain continued to worsen. The robber had two options: to halt Golden Dan and prevent the crack from spreading further, or to disregard the potential consequences and continue the pursuit to eliminate Luu in a mere 0.01 seconds. Hijack made his decision; he chose to press on towards Luu.

A barrage of attacks ensued, with the five elements intertwining and amplifying each other's power, creating a formidable force that hinted at the power of rules. This was undoubtedly Hijack's most potent killing move. Faced with such a powerful onslaught, Luu did not hesitate and immediately activated his sword prison defense. However, the prison was shattered instantly by the five elemental attacks.

Luu was instantly engulfed, and the entire illusion of the five elements was smashed to pieces. The field was in chaos, and Hijack was equally affected, spitting out a mouthful of blood as he struggled to suppress the boiling Chi and blood in his body. He stared intently at the center of the battlefield, hoping that Luu was finally defeated.

However, Luu emerged from the smoke and dust, transformed into a bloody figure, but his eyes remained bright, and his power continued to increase. Even Hijack, who was well aware of Luu's terrifying physical abilities, was taken aback by his resilience. He murmured, "This is my strongest attack, and yet, you still stand."

Despite the formidable five elemental attacks from Hijack, Luu managed to withstand them. His strong physical body, combined with the effects of his equipment and secret medicines, reduced his injuries significantly. Luu's body was strong enough to handle the operation of a dozen secret medicines simultaneously, and with the augmentation of so many buffs, Hijack's attack, which was enough to destroy any J Dynasty Heavenly Pride, only caused him a small superficial wound.

Hijack's move was called "Extreme Intent Five Elements," and it was a peak attack within the realm. However, Luu only suffered some superficial wounds, which was a significant blow to Hijack's confidence. Luu then introduced his move, swallowing the Marshall da golden pill in one gulp. The golden elixir entered his body and operated quickly, enhancing his various attributes and senses.

Luu sensed Hijack's presence in a distant field and charged towards him with terrifying speed. He swung his sword, and it was as if space was going to be sliced open. The entire realm shook, and Hijack was caught off guard. Among the many powerhouses watching, they were all astonished by Luu's power.

Surprisingly, rules still can't aid this human kid, extreme intent of the Five Elements, already considered the strongest move within the realm. It's said to be unbeatable, but this defense is too terrifying.

Ha Luu of the human race has discovered the hiding place of the thief. It must be the effect of swallowing the golden pill, with such a wonderful use outside the reverse entropy Mystic realm, in the ancient race's spaceship.

Tyu looked at the image in front of him, and his eyes widened at the Five Elements of extreme intent of the thief, taking his breath away. However, when this move hit Luu head-on, surprisingly, it only caused him some superficial wounds. Even so, Luu quickly found the hiding place of the thief and attacked it fiercely.

Tyu watched the fierce and crazy battle in front of him for a while, and his mood was complicated. He couldn't help but murmur, "Earlier, you didn't even light up this golden pill. Is this looking down on me, thinking that I'm not worthy of letting you pull out your bottom card, damn human boy?"

At the same time, in the top 16 battle, the various great Prides that had been eliminated all looked at the battle with grave expressions on their faces. They thought it was a one-sided fight towards the thief, but who knew that Luu had hidden such a powerful card and had never used it.

The Heavenly fate of the Sunclan furrowed his brows and admitted to himself that he was far inferior. Little brother is actually this powerful.

Sh of the Tyin clan spoke in surprise, "No wonder I was able to chop me up with a sword. Muttered Snow Moon of the Star feather Clan, Karen of the Beaching Clan, and Lucy of the Siren Clan, even more so, couldn't help but celebrate. It's a good thing we didn't meet him in advance.

When Luu revealed the Marshall da golden pill, the situation was reversed, and the entire human community boiled over with earth-shattering cheers. Everyone was cheering for Luu, expecting him to defeat this strongest opponent and take the title of this Heaven's Pride battle.

Before this, the champion of the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle was simply too far away, but at this moment, it has become within their reach. How can they not go crazy?

Little Marshall Saint, just take the opposite side and you'll win the championship. You can do it. Make a miracle!

Luu and Haack fought fiercely, and the entire floating island was almost shattered. The viewers of the 10,000 races in the universe all stared with wide eyes and held their breaths, staring at the live broadcast screen, unwilling to miss a single moment, fearing that in the blink of an eye, the battle would take a turn for the worse and suddenly end.

This battle was too intense, too wonderful. Under Luu's step-by-step pressing, Haack used all his strengths, and his undercard was spread out as if he didn't need any money. But even then, it still didn't bring the situation under control.

Amidst constant attacks, the flaws of the domain type powerhouses became more and more obvious. Even with the supplementation of various potions and treasures, they still could not make up for the massive amount of energy consumption. Although Luu's consumption was equally horrifying, he was on the path of physical body sanctification, and his consumption was much smaller than the domain.

When Luu was slightly tired, Haack had already reached the edge of exhaustion. The domain was almost impossible to maintain, and the power of the attack was suddenly sharply reduced. Luu decisively seized this opportunity and chopped over with his sword. The sword light flashed, and Haack's head continued to rotate in midair, no longer an illusion but a real head.

Luu looked at Haack full of unwillingness, the emotions in his eyes quite complex. At this point, the winner is Luu.

"If I hadn't created the Marshall da of Ganan, I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to take the title of this Heaven Pride battle," Luu couldn't help but feel emotional in his heart. This Marshall da golden pill has given me a very large increase in battle power. The previous me should not have been a match for this thief, but he won after all.

Champion of the 10,000 Clans Heaven's Pride battle, take down the biggest Ray of civilization flame arrival system stage four, ultimate mission completion.

A wide smile appeared at the corner of Luu's mouth. Finally, he changed the original course of history with Luu taking the title of the heaven's Pride battle.

Amidst the boiling and explosive human community and diverse races in the UN Universe, chapter 203 showcases the human race's triumphant rise. The human community is shaken by the fame and success of its champions, proclaiming "We Are the Champions." This victory crowns the human representative as the champion of the 10,000 clans. The Heavens Pride battle is now in their hands, and they celebrate the significant impact of civilization. Proud of their human race, they applaud, "Bravo to the pride of my human race, Bravo to the might of my human race."

Little Marshall Saint, a remarkable figure, truly embodies the title of a little Marshall Saint. Within the human community, trillions of humans are ecstatic as they witness the miraculous growth of Luu, who started from the initial Heavens Pride ranking and rapidly advanced to the fifth and then the first position. This rapid progression was met with skepticism by some, as they believed Luu's realm was too low and his combat experience insufficient.

However, Luu proved his critics wrong at the first level of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle, earning fame in the universe and becoming a supreme Heavenly Pride that advanced to the fourth level. This was just the beginning of his journey to the championship title. Luu continued to grow, overcoming obstacles and reaching the final showdown. In a dramatic battle, Luu introduced a new cultivation path, the Marshall golden Dan, and defeated the Blood Moon Clan Supreme Pride, Rob.

Luu's victory overcame skepticism, was supported by those around him, and ultimately led to the championship title. This path to the championship proved the might of the human race to the 10,000 races of the universe. The human community, as well as the 10,000 races, were stirred by Luu's triumph.

The alien spectators were shocked when Luu, only four years old, won the title. They initially believed that time was on their side, and Luu would require a longer time to grow. This unexpected outcome was difficult for them to accept. Even during the intense battle, they held onto the hope that Rob could turn the situation around. However, Luu persistently pressed forward, delivering fatal blows and preventing Rob from regaining control.

When Rob's head was finally defeated, some alien spectators still refused to accept the reality, thinking it was just an illusion. However, when the illusion dissipated, they acknowledged Luu as the ultimate Victor. The human race's triumph left many foreigners displeased, but there was nothing they could do.

Luu, a supreme genius, had grown exponentially, surpassing all expectations. Lu Chang xang's mysterious space turned to observe the Reverse Entropy Envoy and asked about his thoughts on Luu. Initially, the Reverse Entropy Envoy believed Luu would struggle to enter the top 10, but Luu's rapid growth forced him to reassess Luu's potential, predicting a top five ranking.

Luu's growth, however, exceeded all expectations, creating a new cultivation method that resonated with the ocean of rules, causing his strength to skyrocket and giving him the potential to win the title. The Reverse Entropy Envoy could not have foreseen Luu's victory, which completed the mission of ascending to the first place of the 10,000 races Heavenly Pride, winning the Heavenly Pride battle's championship, and fighting for the human race's biggest Ray of civilization's flame. This accomplishment earned Luu a reward in the form of a Tai purple gold pill.

In the midst of this climactic battle, Leah, barely maintaining his figure, received a quest prompt and eagerly anticipated the promised flame of civilization.

Envoy had said this: "This greatest strand of the flame of civilization can be considered to be of infinite benefit, whether it is for the clan behind you or for yourselves." In layman's understanding, the "flame of civilization" is similar to Super Invincible enhanced National luck. If this is the case, why does it have an effect on the individual?
Just then, Luu automatically shifted outside the reverse entropy Mystic realm and appeared in the human race's spaceship.
"Congratulations, awesome! That's awesome, champion of the 10,00 Clans, Heavens Pride! Battle the pride of the human race. Surrounded, Luu excitedly praised him by hugging him. Wiping the blood stains from his face, he said with emotion, "Little Marshall Saint, you are truly the light of the human race, a hero of the human race!"
"Right, the light of the human race, hero of the human race," the others said excitedly.
Luu laughed and then looked at Wu Wy and the others, who said excitedly, "That golden elixir on the side... What exactly is it?"
Wua didn't hold back and asked with some curiosity. The moment these words came out, the crowd all looked over in curiosity, even Fong Wang, the president of Blue Star University, looked at Luu curiously. Feeling the gazes of the crowd, Luu smiled and said, "That's the Marshall golden Dan. The path above the golden body realm. The original cultivation method is to condense the Dharma body, form the Dharma phase, and achieve the realm. But this path of the Marshall golden Dan of mine replaces this path. First, condensing the Marshall golden Dan and then leading to the sainthood of the fleshly body. After it is completely solidified, to put it simply, the existence of this Marshall golden Dan makes up for the flaws of the way of the flesh body, which has no domains."
Listening to Luu's narration, Woia couldn't help but ask again, "You started this?"
Luu nodded, "Yes, I created it."
Quietly, the moment these words came out, the entire spaceship instantly fell silent. This path of the Marshall golden Dan was actually really created by Luu. What is the concept of creating a whole new way of cultivation? Its achievement was nothing less than winning the championship of the 10,00 Clans, Heavens Pride battle.
Chapter 204: Flame of Civilization

Taiway Secret Realm

"Did you really start it by yourself?" By Yujing's eyes widened, and she couldn't help but ask again. Although she also knew that Luu would most likely not lie, to say that at this moment would be true, but the news was too impactful. Whether it was by Yujing, Wooi, or even the principal, Fong Wang, it was difficult to accept this fact.

For a moment, this brand new cultivation path was actually really created by Luu. Sure, in the face of skepticism, Luu nodded and said with a smile, "Otherwise, I'm not really good at winning the championship."
Marshall Invincible couldn't help but not his head reasonably speaking, Luu's strength was quite a bit different from winning the championship. No wonder your strength has progressed so much. Being able to defeat the eighth level of the domain, Marshall Invincible said, hearing this, Fong Wang also nodded with emotion.
So that's how it is. You invoked the Resonance of the ocean of rules and gained quite a bit of growth from it. Rule the ocean.
The crowd's jaws dropped when they heard those four words. Participating in the ocean of rules, how many martial artists had sought for this? But the problem was that one had to master the power of the origin laws and survey the way of the rules in order to touch the ocean of rules. The difficulty of this prerequisite is just too high.
Of course, there is a second way, and that is to create a new path of cultivation. The question is, which one is going to be even harder?
Amidst the crowd's boasting and marveling, Luu glanced at the quest reward: Tai Purple Gold Pill. Rank ninth quality. Immortal type. Consumable. Effect after taking this Elixir: the upper limit of Mana can be greatly increased while at the same time improving the understanding of the nature of the da. There is a probability of realizing an innate Divine ability from it.
Description: Abbot Immortal Mountain Emperor's Immortal Elixir. An immortal Elixir that can be taken even by those in lower Realms. A treasure that can be found but not sought.
Luu's eyes lit up as he looked at the description of the Elixir. It was another ninth ranked Immortal Elixir. Good stuff. Absolutely great stuff. Worthy of being the system's final mission. It was the same as Lou You expected it. It was really the ninth rank. This Elixir has three effects:
1. A significant increase in the Mana cap. For Luu, who was a martial artist, what was boosted should be the power of chi and blood, as well as qi. At this point, compared to those domain powerhouses, he would have had an advantage. Now, the advantage is even greater.
2. To enhance the understanding of the nature of the da. Similar to the effect of the Tiu Diffractive Dharma Pill but it's a little different. Follow the description. At its core, it's supposed to enhance Enlightenment. It would be cool if Enlightenment could be increased dramatically by the later stages of exposure to the rules. Enlightenment is the key to unlocking one's true potential.
3. There is a probability of realizing an innate Divine ability from it. This was the most exciting part. Luu had always been fascinated by the concept of innate Divine abilities. The idea of having a unique power that no one else possessed was thrilling. He couldn't wait to see what kind of innate Divine ability he would realize after taking the Elixir.
Luu couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement and anticipation. He had come so far, and now, he was on the brink of achieving something truly extraordinary. He couldn't wait to see what the future held for him.

There is a probability of realizing an innate Divine ability from it, which is why Luu furrowed his brows. While it wasn't a certainty, this was a ninth-order Immortal Elixir. On second thought, this should be a side effect. The name of this life aptitude sounds very unusual. Could he realize it? Luu blinked.

Suddenly, in front of Luu's eyes, a line of hint appeared, not from the system, but from the secret realm of reverse entropy. "Congratulations, the Pride of the Human Race, Lou. You have defeated opponent after opponent and won this Heaven's Pride battle. In recognition of your greatness, this flame of civilization is the ultimate reward for you and the human race behind you. Please catch it."

The prompt appeared, and a wisp of ghostly blue flame suddenly appeared in front of Luu's eyes, slowly drifting down. Luu subconsciously reached out and caught it. At that moment, a massive amount of information instantly impacted his Sea of Consciousness. Luu's eyes widened as he saw the vastness of the ocean, one city after another, the uncertainty of the wind and clouds, the rushing river, the speed of cars and boats, and the crowd of people coming and going. He also saw the sun and moon change, the seasons change, and the cycle of life and death. Luu vaguely understood that this was civilization and the root of the flame of civilization—the mountains and rivers, the Earth's veins, and the planets in motion. The wisp of civilization's fire was so fragile yet brilliant and colorful. This was the Eternal Melody Among the Stars. In a trance, Luu saw a barren planet of life, the tragic battlefield of the human race's frontier, and the planet that had just been recovered. This was the Taiwisen realm. Why did he see it here?

Just when Luu had some doubts, he saw again in the middle of the Taiwisen star domain a large unexplored secret realm, which was the place where the star vein of the Taiwisen star domain was located. It was an ancient relic that had never been discovered, with countless exotic treasures inside. There were precious resources like mountains and seas, the principle of the rise of a civilization. There were also terrifying secret monsters, powerful natives inherited from ancient civilizations. At this moment, everything was displayed in front of Luu without any reservations. Luu's breathing was a bit rapid. As the son of a martial saint, he was aware of the preciousness of these things and knew what it really meant. Originally, Luu was still a bit curious about the so-called fire of civilization. On what basis could a civilization gradually rise? On what basis could it serve as the super invincible enhanced national fortune? Now, the answer was revealed. Just a wisp of the flame of civilization had brought the human race such a chance. That was awesome.

Luu couldn't help but marvel in his heart at this moment. All the people inside the spaceship saw the appearance of the ray of civilization fire and waited with baited breath, not daring to disturb Luu. After sensing the civilization fire for a long time, Luu slowly opened his eyes. Fong Wang asked curiously, "Very impressive." Luu said in admiration. Such important news could not be spoken easily. Once it leaked out, it would easily cause foreign races to covet it and lead to widespread war. Humanity's current situation wasn't too good, with all the strong enemies of the 10,000 races surrounding them. They were surrounded by enemies on all sides. If this news was known by the foreign races, the entire Taiwisen star domain would be plunged into war. Luckily, Luu wasn't alone. He had his Marshall St Pops that he could rely on. He just needed to tell Pops about the news, and Pops would take care of everything properly.

The spaceship traveled through a wormhole, and Luu was about to return to the human community. The news that Luu had won the 10,000 races' Heaven's Pride battle spread throughout the 10,000 races of the universe at an astonishing speed. Luu's reputation was thoroughly spread. Compared to the last time when he broke through to the ninth floor in The Reincarnation Tower and displayed the posture of a martial saint, which was also amazing enough, he hadn't grown up after all. This time, the 10,000 Clans' Heaven's Pride battle topping the list of all the five Realms' Heaven's Pride caused countless foreign races to gasp in amazement. Some foreign civilians inevitably drummed in their hearts. Could it be that the human race is really going to have a second Marshall Saint?

Since Luu took the title of the 10,000 Clans' Heaven's Pride battle, there were quite a few variables that had arisen. Many of the Seer groups caught wind of this and relied on it like wallflowers. Some medium-sized communities were even more decisive in conveying their goodwill to the human race. As for those powerful ethnic groups, they were thinking about how to find their way back on the battlefield. Since the 10,000 Clans' Heaven's Pride battle was lost, it would be one back in the war. Among them was the Blood Moon Pack, which lost in the finals. They were originally in with the human race, so there was little need to think of reasons for waging war.

In the depths of the dark and deep starry sky, an ordinary planet orbiting a star looks like nothing special. But when a spaceship approaches the planet, suddenly, a huge eye opens. The dark yellow, eerie fur looks calmly at

The ship carrying the Star God Clan's powerhouse hurriedly flew out and bowed respectfully before reporting the latest news. "I have known for a long time that within the vacuum of space, the grand voice of the Star God Corsair echoed. Hearing these words, the posture of the Star God Clan powerhouse grew more and more humble. He said helplessly, "The plan to assassinate Lu You is still being prepared, but I didn't realize he had already grown to this level. What a pity, a pity indeed."

Star God Corsair spoke faintly, "If he succeeds in assassinating him, that human Marshall Saint will definitely go crazy, and the picture will definitely be interesting. But there's no point in saying that anymore. After what happened, as the son of a Marshall Saint, the human race's protection for him will inevitably be incomparably thorough. Trying to accomplish an assassination would have been difficult. This is not your problem. You can only wait patiently, wait for him to grow up further, wait until the time when he goes out to break through and fight around. Then is our opportunity. For the sake of his path to sainthood, the human race will definitely try everything to stop him from becoming a saint. Not only our Star God Clan, but other clans will also take action."

The Star God Clan powerhouse lowered himself even further. Since the Divine Lord had already decided, he naturally didn't have any objections.

At Blue Star Marshall Saint's residence, Lu You, who had just returned to Blue Star, had a feeling of being a world away when his feet stepped on the earth. It was an amazing feeling. It was clear that the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle hadn't been going on for long.

"You're back, our little human hero. You actually became the champion of the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle!" Seeing Lu You return, Bayu Ya looked especially happy. Although she knew that her own son was a super genius, she still didn't expect that Lu You would actually win the Heavens Pride battle. After all, even a genius needs time to grow up. However, Lu You's rise to power was as if he didn't need time to pave the way. It was like riding a rocket, soaring at a terrifying speed. It felt like a sudden turn of events that he became so strong. But Bayu Ya also understood that there was nothing so easy in this world. Lu You gained so many achievements without his hard practice at a young age.

"You carry such a heavy burden," Bayu Ya said, looking at Lu You with pride and a little heartbreak.

"Mom," Lu You raised his head and shouted with a smile, "I'm awesome, right? Awesome! It's too awesome! Our human race's little Marshall Saint is just extraordinary!"

"That's right," Bayu Ya said with a smile. Lu Chang Xing also returned and looked at Lu You with relief. Only after Bayu Ya and Lu You had said their goodbyes did Lu Chang Xing open his mouth and say, "I have something to say to you. Come with me to the Ten Thousand Laws Building."

Hearing this, Lu You immediately nodded. "Good. What is it that you can't say here?" Bayu Ya glanced at Lu Chang Xing. "You two, father and son, what secrets are you hiding from me?"

"Mom, of course, it's something important," Lu You said. "You can also come over if you want to know."

"Lu Chang Xing said with a smile. Bayu Ya thought about it and shook her head. "Forget it. It's better to give you two, father and son, some space."

Inside the Manifestation Building, Lu You and Lu Chang Xing sat on the futon after closing the door behind him. Lu Chang Xing opened his mouth and asked, "Can you show me that Marshall Da Golden Pill of yours?"

When these words came out, Lu You was slightly stunned. He had thought that his old man would ask about the Flame of Civilization first. However, compared to the Flame of Civilization, Lu Chang Xing was surprisingly more concerned about the Marshall Da Jin Dan. Lu You didn't think too much about it and with a light slap of his palm on his chest, the Wu Da Golden Pill slowly rotated and floated out.

Looking at this Marshall Golden Pill up close, Lu Chang Xing's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but look at it closely. "Sure enough, exactly as I suspected. It's a cultivation path that can be perfected." Lu Chang Xing turned his head to Lu You and asked with a smile, "Dad, is discussing something with you? What is it?" Lu You asked with some curiosity.

"I want to help you perfect this way of Marshall Da Golden Dan and then preach it to the world so that all the martial artists of all races will have the opportunity to walk on this way of Marshall Da Golden Dan," Lu Chang Xing said with a serious and solemn expression. "What do you think?"

Lu You replied without thinking. There were still a lot of imperfections in his Marshall Da Golden Dan path, and if he were to slowly perfect it himself, it would definitely take a long time. But if the Marshall Sage helped, it would become much easier. Also, it was equally natural to preach to the world so that all martial artists of all races would have the opportunity to follow this path. Lu You was not one of those martial arts school teachers who thought about teaching the disciple to starve the master and kept his hand in everything. He was the son of the human race's Marshall Saint, enjoying the supreme glory that he was born with but not having the opportunity to give back to the human race. Now that he is pioneering the martial arts and preaching to the world, he will naturally not hesitate.

Here is the improved text:

Do you refuse to do your part for the human race? Is there any need to hesitate about this? Seeing Luu agreeing down without thinking, Lu Chang xang nodded in relief. Some axioms are simple to say, but when it comes to self-interest, it's a different matter. It's good that you understand, Lu Chang xang said seriously. This Marshall da Jinan path of yours is a completely different path from Dharma Body and Dharma Phase. This is equivalent to giving those Realm martial artists a second choice, a second possibility of extraordinary significance. If one day a cloud of strong Ganan practitioners of the Marshall da of my human race rises, you will be the greatest contributor to my human race. Luu blinked. In that case, he was considered to be the Grandmaster of martial arts who started the mountain and established the sect. How would the history books of the human human race record themselves? A four-year-old martial arts Grandmaster? This is just too much. Those descendants, I'm afraid, won't believe it at all. When he thought of those powerful people who practiced the Marshall arts Ganan Path, having to worship Him the martial arts ancestor, Luu felt a little amused. 

In that case, the Marshall way of Ganan Dan that he had pioneered was really greater than that whisp of Civilization fire in terms of subsequent influence. The fire of civilization thing hasn't been said yet. Luu raised his head. "Chapter 206: The Law of the Marshall Golden Dan, The Flame of Civilization." 

Luu opened his mouth to say something about the Revelation brought about by that Ray of civilization's fire. Who knew that Lu Chang shang didn't care at all? He shook his head and said, "The matter of the flame of civilization will be discussed later. Let's first perfect this Marshall Ganan path." Lu Chang shang did things with a clear sense of priorities. Although the flame of civilization was important, it was still slightly inferior to the DA of Marshall Ganan. So, he dealt with this matter first. Hearing this, Luu could only nod. With the help of his old man, Lu Chang xang, the originally very rudimentary, extremely imperfect martial arts Ganan path, which only Luu alone could cultivate, was rapidly perfected. The entire cultivation system, as well as the use of the Marshall Golden Elixir, was checked, from the shallowest to the deepest. During this process, Luu's mind marveled at his old man's power more than once. Despite surging forward on the path of cultivation, the gap between him and Pops didn't seem to have shortened much.

Lu Chang shang conjectured that after just a slight attempt, not a bad path, but unfortunately, it's no longer of any use to me. This path of cultivation of yours is the path of cultivation after the fifth realm, and under the eighth realm, there is no difference between this path and the original cultivation path, between high and low, up and down, that is to say, not belonging to a small path but a brilliant great path with the gradual improvement. Lu Chang shang discovered a new problem. If you let a fifth realm martial artist condense Ganan Dan right off the bat, it's simply impossible to succeed. You're a special example. If you were to be used as an example to ask other cultivators, then this DA of Marshall Ganan for the entire human race, there wouldn't be a few who could successfully cultivate it. 

Luu couldn't help but blink when he heard this. As the founding ancestor of the Marshall da Jinan, for him, those things that suit him and are taken for granted are not the same thing at all. For others, those ordinary martial artists, then the difficulty of cultivation had to be lowered. We can only let those martial artists take it one step at a time. Lu Chang shang said after some thought and then disassembled the way of Marshall Ganan step by step. The fifth realm first condenses the dhad Dan corresponding to the Dharma Body, which is the first step in the path of the Marshall DA's golden Dan. The six Realms turning Dharma Dan is a true Dan that corresponds to the Dharma phase level, and this step enhances the physical body with inscriptions. The Seven Realms of true Dan turning into Ganan corresponds to the realm level, which is the final form of the Marshall DA's ganan Dan. 

Originally, the physical body martial arts path could not be accomplished by non-top Geniuses, but with the path of the martial arts Golden Dan, even ordinary martial artists can try their hand at it, after a long time. Lu Chang shang compiled a book, "The Method of Marshall da Jinan," which was the original Marshall Dan cultivation technique, above the name of the author of the book, Luu was in the first place, and Lu Chang shang was in the second place, which made Luu feel a little embarrassed because he didn't put in much effort. But Lu Chang shang said rightfully, this Marshall path was created by you, I'm just helping you perfect it. If I don't sign your first place, should I put it behind me? Is this not stealing your credit? Luu could only nod his head.

After perfecting the DA of Marshall Ganan, the two of them talked about the matter of the flame of civilization. Only then did Luu speak of the secret Realm of the Taiway Astral Domain. Lu Chang shang listened carefully, and after a long while, he nodded and said, "Okay, I'll make arrangements for this matter. Don't worry, I'll handle it properly. I also want to go explore the secret realm." Luu voiced his thoughts: he wanted to go to the outside world to have a look, to really venture out.

Lu Chang Chang laughed. Do you think I would let you go? Luu's head shook subconsciously, then he hastily nodded. Why are you asking? Lu Changxang asked with a smile. You're all subconsciously thinking I won't let you go, but I want to go back to the secret realm and have an adventure. Luu said stubbornly. I want to go to the secret realm and have an adventure, just like my father, a marshal Saint. As the son of a marshal Saint, you could enjoy all sorts of cultivation resources, even if you didn't take any risks. Unlike those ordinary martial artists who risked their lives to fight for cultivation resources. The fact is, a thousand gold's son doesn't sit still. It's a simple truth, but the thing is, if you want to be truly unique and carry the banner of the human community, you can't be pampered.

Leu had gradually made a name for himself through the Reincarnation Tower and the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle. However, that alone wasn't enough. Regardless of whether it was the Reincarnation Tower or the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle, they were both adventurers who didn't risk their lives. Luu was still far from truly growing up and being on his own. The current human community wasn't in danger of being destroyed, and everything was thriving. But what about the future? If everything was thriving, then there was no need for Luu to fight so hard. But from what the system says, the future is bad. Papa Musha is tough; the situation is very bad as it is. So, you would have to find a way to change things. The 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was only the first step. Looking at Luu's firm gaze, Lu Changxin was slightly stunned after thinking for a moment. Lu Changxin nodded and said, "It's not impossible if you want to venture to the secret realm. Really, okay."

Luu's eyes whitened at once. He hadn't really thought that his old man would actually agree. But well, there are conditions. Lu Changxin said what conditions? Luu asked in a hurry. Break through the ninth level of the Blue Star University's trial mystery realm. Lu Changxin looked at Luu and said, "Breaking through the ninth floor of the secret realm of Trials." Luu froze for a moment and subconsciously repeated himself, "Right, Lu Changxin." Lu Changxin nodded. Your old man, I was the one who broke through the ninth layer before I started going to secret Realms and battlefields. If you want to go on an adventure, break through the ninth floor first. Otherwise, don't even think about it.

Luu heard this and raised his head, saying seriously, "Good, I will break through the ninth floor, no matter what." Lu Changxin smiled. There are still conditions. Luu stared. Of course, Lu Changxin reached out his hand and gently tapped on Luu's brow, leaving a mark. "What is this?" Luu asked, feeling a mysterious power at the center of his eyebrows. "My soul seal," Lu Changxin said. "When your life is in danger, my soul seal will automatically appear and come out to help you solve all the crises." Luu was a bit surprised, but Lu Changxin nodded slightly. "Once you consume this soul seal, you won't be able to venture out again for 3 years." Luu asked, of course. "3 years, meaning after 3 years, the adventure can continue?" Luu asked. Lu Changxin smiled. Since you are my son, Lu, how can you not go on adventures for the rest of your life? This way, you'll never truly grow up and become a marshal saint.

This unique martial arts path was exclusively crafted by me, and only a prodigy like myself can attempt it for a second, though your talents are commendable, it remains too challenging and complex to master. However, having created this New Path, I must find a way to perfect it and then share it with the world, so that all martial artists of every race can walk the path of Marshall Golden Dan. This is equivalent to offering a second choice, a second significant opportunity, to fifth realm martial artists.

Upon hearing Luu's words, everyone was filled with admiration, acknowledging his far-sighted vision and strategy. Indeed, Luu was the only son they had. He smiled and continued, but the task is arduous. My current realm is low, and my strength is not particularly impressive, so perfecting this path may take a considerable amount of time, making it too slow.

That's why I sought out my old martial arts Saint father, and we collaborated to author the law of Marshall Golden Dan. Now, regardless of whether you are human martial artists or not, you will be able to cultivate this martial art, the Marshall da Jinan method.

The crowd grew excited at those words. Big brother is wise, they thought. Big brother has the solution. The Marshall da Genan Danan method, I too wish to cultivate, a group of young martial artists declared.

Chuang even hastened to say, since then, big brother is the martial arts Grandmaster who started the mountain and established the school. Right, Marshall ancestor, big brother is the Marshall ancestor, the crowd repeated like a chorus on the side. Yanching slapped his thigh, wondering why he hadn't thought of that earlier.

Luu nodded slightly, and the banquet continued. The crowd chatted about various topics, and Luu listened attentively. He was slightly stunned when he heard that the crowd had become much more diligent and started cultivating fervently due to Luu.

Luu smiled and said, that's great. Don't be presumptuous. You are the Future Hope of the human race. Even if I'm excellent, I'm just me. You have such a good birth, of course, you should work harder since you guys have such a realization. I'm relieved.

Much conversation followed about the human race, the foreigners, and the battlefield. Just then, Luu suddenly sighed. Yuguan Ching was jolted, and subconsciously asked, big brother, why are you sighing? If there is something, just say it directly.

When these words came out, all the gazes of the crowd turned towards Luu. He pondered for a moment and slowly spoke, everyone should know that I am now the Taiway Star, the Lord of 138 planets. Due to my age and strength, I have not been able to go over and preside over affairs, but I've heard about the situation over there from time to time, and I know that it's in dire straits.

Because of its remoteness and the planet's poor climatic conditions, these living planets are not rich or strong and are in war zones. Some of them have even fallen into alien hands due to war. Nowadays, we hold banquets here, eat wine, and enjoy ourselves, but when I think of the miserable state of my 138 planets, I can't help but feel a pang in my heart. These planets are part of our human race. How can they be left unattended?

This matter had been mentioned once before by Luu, but from a completely different perspective. Before, he was talking about the war, but at the moment, he is concerned about the plight of the people. The moment these words came out, within the Yagang Pavilion, there was an immediate reaction.

Big Brother, this isn't a good solution, my Cheu family doesn't have much of anything, just a lot of money, a lot of people, and a lot of supplies, Chu Young hurriedly spoke. Big brother, I thought it was something difficult, it's just a matter of money and people, the little chubby Pin yunai said in a wealthy and generous manner. Yeah, yeah, it's just a matter of supporting the poor planets. If we let anyone family do it, it would naturally be difficult, but if we work together, it's definitely not a problem.

Yanching nodded and said seriously. The people spoke with one voice and clamored to do their part. As the saying goes, the pup sells his heart anyway. It wasn't their own family fortune that they had fought for. This group of powerful children almost without thinking about it when Luu heard this, he smiled and said, this matter is extraordinary. Everyone's Goodwill I appreciate it if you really want to support it, please also go home and explain the situation to your elders. Getting their approval is the key.

When the people heard this, they all nodded and then hurried home to talk about this matter with their families. No matter what, at least pull a few million billion dollars of investment, the parents of these little ones listened, and their faces darkened. How much a few trillion, that's no way to commit a robbery.

Chapter 208: Triggering the Breaking into the Secret Realm Quest
You just got the champion of the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle, and you want those Clans to invest heavily in you isn't that a bit too presumptuous?

Jaia Wanyuan felt only mild amusement as he listened to Luu's narration. He shook his head and said, "You wouldn't have been so this time." It was Luu's turn to be smug as he smiled and said, "Of course not. I'm not asking for investment but I'm giving them a chance." Hearing this, Jaia Wanyuan froze slightly, then nodded and said, "The strand of civilization flame you harvested is related to the Taiway Astral Domain." Luu stared, "How did you know that, Master?" Jaia Wanyuan said indifferently, "Can't I still see through your little mind, Luu?" Luu had wanted to show off and let his master make a good guess before finally announcing the answer. Who knew that as soon as he came up, Jaia Wanyuan gave a guess. "That's insight. It's scary as hell," Jaia Wanyuan admired Luu's stunned expression and continued, "Let me guess again. That wisp of civilization flame should have informed you of some unexplored star zones or rather, unexplored secret realms. I think it would be the latter. I'll take another guess as to where the secret realm might appear." Dash Jawanan casually opened the Starfield map and quickly pointed at a few places. "It should be in one of these places." "Why would it be one of these places?" Luu asked with some curiosity. "Back then, when I commanded the Army and fought in the Taiway Starfield, I carefully explored the Taiway Starfield, and there were only a few places that weren't quite right and there might be secret realms. But unfortunately, I never found a way to open them," Xiao Wuan slowly said, then he looked at the map of the Starfield, intending to analyze it carefully. "Master, can't you say it again?" Luu hastily stopped him. "This is a secret that needs to be kept secret from beginning to end. Only one person said it with pops. Who would have thought that Master would analyze it in a few words? This insight ability is simply too terrifying. He finally realized why his master was able to serve as the Chief Marshall of the Grand SE while he had only learned a little bit after studying for so long." When Xiao Wuan heard this, he didn't say anything and casually closed the Starfield map. "Master, do you think those Clans will guess my true thoughts?" Luu asked. "That's natural. They're all some smart people and will definitely make some guesses," Xiao Wan slowly said. "So, this counts as me being a smartass?" Luu skimmed his lips and said with some depression. "Not really," Xiao Wuan shook his head. "They merely have a guess. They can't really conclude that it's worth giving them a reward for daring to bet heavily on you under such circumstances." Luu nodded, then asked, "I plan to venture to that secret realm, Master. Do you want to go with me to the Taiway Astral Domain?" Abducting his master, the Sword Emperor, the former Chief Marshal of the Grand SE, to the Taiway Astral Domain was Luu's ultimate goal. He hadn't forgotten the system's main quest yet: to recover those living planets that originally belonged to humans. Now, he had only completed the first stage of the mission, and there were still a lot of tasks left to complete. If he could lull Master over to sit in the Taiway Star Domain and recover those fallen planets, he would definitely have a better chance. As this thought was born, Luu's eyes immediately appeared in front of him: the prompt panel of the system's mission. Special Mission triggered: Luu swept a glance as if nothing had happened. "You have successfully won the championship of the 10,000 races' Heavenly Pride battle, obtaining the largest strand of civilization flame, and in doing so, you have made your name in the universe and shaken the 10,000 races. But you deeply understand that it's hard to change anything with just a single flame of civilization, and you need to do more as a way to change the bad situation of the moment, such as exploring the secret realm suggested by this ray of civilization flame and using it to grow the human race. This is your duty as the son of the Marshall Saint." Stage one mission: Qualify for an expedition to the Secret World. Mission reward: Yu onling fruit. Stage two quest: Explore 1% of the secret world and bring back treasures of equal value. Mission reward: Concentration pill. Stage three quest: Explore 5% of the secret world and bring back treasures of equal value. Mission reward: Wuin Dan. Stage four quest: Explore 10% of the secret world and bring back treasures of equal value. Mission reward: Nine turn Tai Chang Dan. Stage five mission: Take complete control of the entire secret realm and obtain all the treasures in the secret realm. Mission reward: Unknown for the time being. It is worth noting that the loot brought back will determine the quality of the mission rewards. Looking at the task in front of him, Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows. "Who set this mission? It's so flexible. Bring back loot that directly determines the quality of the mission reward. Moreover, for the fifth stage of the quest, the reward was actually temporarily unknown. What's that supposed to mean? Is it because you think there's no way you can accomplish this, so you just don't announce it? The district system, how dare you underestimate me?" Luu did not think much about it and looked up at his master, Xiao Wuan. Xiao Wuan furrowed his brows, seemingly pondering over the issue, and did not notice Luu's change in expression. After a long time, Xiao Wuan fatly asked, "Your father agreed to you going to the secret realm?"

Place isn't the Reincarnation Tower or the 10,000 Clans' Heavens Pride battle; it's something that can really kill you," Luu replied. He said that as long as I break through the ninth level of the trial Mystic realm, he would allow me to venture into the Mystic realm," Xia Wanan nodded slightly. "I see, however, I remember that we discussed this matter before, and at that time, my answer was that the time was not yet right. It is the same now," Luu said with some reluctance.

"When the time comes, it will naturally arrive," Xia Wuan replied. "So, Lou, you glaring master, this reply of yours is too perfunctory." However, since Master still disagreed, there was nothing that could be done. Afterward, Luu practiced for a while at his master's place and then went to the Jinin Dojo at Blue Star University.

Having won the 10,000 races Heaven Pride battle Championship, he was now a superb celebrity with people surrounding him everywhere he went. Blue Star University was no exception. Many students, as the first batch of people to learn Luu's method of Marshall da Jinan, respectfully addressed him as the Marshall da ancestor. This feeling was just not the same. This generation was rubbing it in. Not to mention these students, even those teachers and professors had approached Luu to ask for advice on the Marshall da Jinan.

Facing the crowd's request for advice, Luu didn't hide anything. However, Luu had no way to refer to their caliber and give an answer that they could understand. Only some straightforward explanations can be given. This caused a group of old professors and teachers to be a bit confused. Then they discussed it and took them half a day to figure out Luu's answer. When he wanted to ask for advice again, Luu had already begun his seclusion. Next, he was going to break into the ninth level of the trial Mysteries before that; it was necessary to shut down for a period of time to boost your strength as much as possible.

Chapter 209: Extreme Divine Beheading
Time passed day by day, and it was a week in the blink of an eye. This time, Luu integrated the many insights he had gained since the 10,000 Clans Heaven Pride battle. There's no doubt that this adds to his overall strengths. Only what made Luu a bit unintelligible was what exactly was the benefit of that wisp of civilization's fire to himself? A sense of civilization if it was just that little bit of Enlightenment, it didn't seem to be enough to match the value of this flame of civilization. It should be more than that. Thinking about it and not having a result, Luu threw this question to the almighty Marshall St. Pops.

Pops gave an immediate answer. The flame of civilization is used for two purposes. First, it could be used as a bridge to communicate the rules, allowing Luu to have a higher rule Affinity. Second, the flame of civilization was one of the key factors in breaking through to the 10th realm. After receiving this answer, Luu then realized the preciousness of this wisp of civilization flame. Sure, breaking through to the 10th realm was just too far away for the current Luu. The increased affinity for rules is good news. With the end of The Retreat, Luu didn't hesitate and stepped into the secret Realm of Trials once again, going to break into the ninth level.

When Luu arrived at the secret realm of Trials, the news spread. This was the first time Luu, the champion of the 10,000 races Heaven Pride battle, had broken into the trial mystery realm after his return. Before that, he had broken through the eighth layer of the trial Mystic realm and with that, he was ranked number one on the human race's Heaven Pride ranking. After representing the human race to participate in the 10,000 races Heaven Pride battle, he even went all the way through and won the championship, making a name for himself in the universe. Now that he is returning, will he be able to break through the ninth floor?

Since the establishment of Blue Star University, among the current students, those who were able to break through the eighth level of the trial mystery realm could be described as a phoenix. As for those who had broken through the ninth level of the trial Mysteries, there was even only one person, and that was the former Marshall St. Lu Chang. Now, will Luu be the second person? Many students from Blue Star University had spent their credits to watch this wonderful battle. Even some of the teachers and professors were concerned. Not to mention those Seven Realms professors who hadn't managed to break through the ninth floor, not to mention those University teachers, most of whom hadn't even broken through the eighth floor. At this moment, Luu had walked to the ninth floor, so one could imagine how terrifying it was.

The Secret World of Trials' ninth floor, the gatekeeper, looked at Luu and said with some surprise, "How long has it been since I've seen you? You've actually gotten a little stronger again." The entire trial secret realm, the coldest is his ninth floor. Every month, trespassers on this side of the barrier can be said to be only a handful. What's more, Luu's age was still so young. So the Guardians of the ninth floor were deeply impressed with Luu.

"Hello, Guardian Luu," Luu smiled and said, "please let me see the power of domain 9." This scene seemed like deja vu, but Luu was no longer the same as he was back then and had obviously gotten a lot stronger. Even the guardian of the ninth floor nodded cautiously. He snapped his fingers, and the ninth floor's power was revealed.

Amidst the rapidly transforming scene around him, a sea of magma appeared directly beneath the Domain World of Fire. This was no longer a simple domain vaguely resembling a world; compared to long ago, Luu's feelings about this place were even more genuine. He dared not be arrogant and offered his Marshall Dow Golden Dan, asking the gatekeeper what he thought of it.

The gatekeeper, curious, asked about the offering. Luu replied that it was a brand new Marshall path he pioneered, named Marshall Da Golden Dan. The gatekeeper realized Luu's strength had significantly improved and commended his talent, recalling that he hadn't seen someone as gifted in a very long time. He believed the human race had a worthy successor in Luu.

The gatekeeper then became more serious, raising his hands to unleash Wind and Fire chaos. Unlike the last time, the flames now borrowed the wind's momentum, taking the power to a new level. Raging flames instantly filled the entire field, and the power had increased substantially.

Luu, with the help of the Ganan Domain released by The Marshall Ganan, barely fought back against the Furious Wind in Fire chaos. However, this Ganan Domain couldn't be sustained for long. In an instant, the Gan Dan Domain was about to collapse. Luu remained calm, narrowed his eyes, and chopped away with his long sword.

The students watching the battle were amazed by the power of the Sword Returning to the Ruins, which broke through the flames in the sky and directly struck the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper revealed that his body was just a fake, and the voices of other gatekeepers came from all directions. They challenged Luu to break through the ninth floor with only this skill, urging him to show his true colors.

The teachers, professors, and even Fong Wang, the president of Blue Star University, watched the live stream. They discussed the beauty and difficulty of the ninth floor. Luu didn't hesitate and swallowed the Golden Dan, which would improve his attributes and sixth sense. He sensed the ninth-level keeper's hiding place and confidently invited the gatekeeper to try his sword.

With a simple starting stance, Luu's aura sent chills down the gatekeeper's spine. Fong Wang, too, felt unease upon learning the significance of Luu's sword, the Dash Pull Chopping God, from Sword Emperor Jiao. This legendary technique had earned Jiao his fame by beheading Divine Sons and a Demag good.

The students at Blue Star University were thrilled to witness such an intense battle, as the difficulty of the ninth floor was no joke. Luu's progress had surpassed even Sword Emperor Jia's expectations, leaving everyone in awe.

Having broken through as a student, you caught the eager attention of all the students. Your swift and decisive actions in the live broadcast left everyone in awe. Without the slightest hesitation, you swung out a sword, pulling Chopper along with its terrifying energy. This sword, known as the Divine Beheading, contained the power of the stars of Heaven and Earth. The sword cut through the sky with a clear, bright light, and the dancing fire that was once ubiquitous as the wind completely disappeared.
Above the sky, the lower half of the ninth level guardian's body disappeared. He threw back his head and laughed painfully, exclaiming, "Ouch! The sword was indeed terrifying, but I was not defeated by it. Half of the guardian's body was suspended in the air, revealing a white spine. He lowered his head and spoke with a smile, "Just a little bit more, and you would have cut me down. It's your turn. You get a taste of my move."
The name of his move was Hell's Red Lotus. He rose and danced, and the Red Lotus fire from hell emerged in an instant. Legend has it that the Red Lotus fire is the karmic fire of hell that burns up all things with Souls. The Red Lotus flame that was spreading across the sky at the moment was similar to the legendary Karma flame. Luu could only barely fight, but he was still unable to defeat this hell Red Lotus flame and was eliminated from the game.
In the blink of an eye, Luu broke and entered, failing still lost. Luu furrowed his brows, summarizing the many questions of his party to conclude that if the sword Divine Beheading could be fully mastered, then breaking through the ninth floor would no longer be a problem. At that time, if he had used his talent sword da tonin and then used the sword Xin Shen, he might have been able to behead the gatekeeper. However, it doesn't make much sense, and he'll get hurt by it. Instead, as his strength increased and the power of his attacks increased, the more sword Dow rules were needed, and the greater the negative effects brought about by sword da tonin. This is a double-edged sword that should never be used lightly.
Until the critical moment before he came here, he knew the difficulty of the ninth level and was clear that it would be difficult for him to break through. After all, the ninth level of the domain was not a level at all compared to the eighth level of the domain. Just because Luu was able to defeat the domain 8 hijack didn't mean that he could defeat the domain 9 Guardian. After the domain's great accomplishment, each weight was a Heavenly Rift. The seventh weight domain was a great fulfillment, the eighth level was the summit, and the ninth was the world taking shape. The difference between a weight and a cloud of mud was immense. How hard was it to cross the rift valley in a short time? Luckily, he was open.
Luu glanced at the system space, and on the most conspicuous position, there was an Immortal Elixir quietly placed. Because this Elixir was too precious, Luu did not take it easily. His idea was simple: let's first wait until he had digested the gains he had made during this period of time and then look at the gap between himself and the ninth level of the domain.

Indeed, it was worthy of being a ninth-rank Immortal Elixir. Luu quickly discarded any distracting thoughts and became completely absorbed in the Great Da. It was unclear how long had passed, but in Luu's mind, an array of spiritual light like shooting stars rapidly flashed by. Luu was slightly stunned but quickly realized this was the opportunity to participate in the essence Avatar. According to the effect of the Tha Purple Gold Pill, there was a probability of realizing an innate Divine ability from it. Whether he could truly comprehend it depended on Luu's skill. Without hesitation, Luu immediately immersed himself in it, constantly comprehending it.

The Tiue Immortal Cell Taiu Diffractive Dharma Pill began to operate slowly, making Luu's Enlightenment twice as effective. It was like a heavy fog being lifted, and Luu's eyes grew brighter and brighter. So it is so, enlightened. With the help of the Tiue Immortal Cells and the Tiue Diffractive Dharma Pill, Luu gradually comprehended a Gifted Divine ability, named Wind God Feather. Its effect was pure and direct, an increase in pure speed, one word: quick. Luu slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes flashed with delight. He could clearly feel the power of this innate Divine ability. As the saying goes, all martial arts under the sun are indestructible; only fast and unbreakable.

Chapter 211: Breaking Through the Ninth Floor, Passing Through the Secret Realm of Trials. Originally, the White Jade Wind in Fire Wheel, a supreme treasure, was considered to have made up for Luu's flaws in his stance. However, against top powerhouses, it was difficult to gain the upper hand with just the White Jade Wind and Fire Wheel. It wasn't that the White Jade Wind and Fire Wheel didn't work anymore; the increase they brought was limited and hardly a decisive factor. Simply put, abuse was fine, but if they met someone one level more powerful than Luu, it wouldn't be very favorable. Breaking through with the weak and fighting across levels belonged to the family routine, but it would be tough.

At this time, an additional speed-type aptitude was truly like a tiger with wings, Wind God Feather. Luu carefully felt the effects of this talented Avatar and his heart grew more and more in admiration. So much for that, Luu took all three effects of the Taiu Purple Gold Pill. Afterward, Luu felt for a while longer and continued his cultivation to maximize the effects of the Tai Purple Gold Pill. A few days passed in the blink of an eye, and when Luu opened his eyes again, his eyes were filled with delight. Yes, it's just a great feeling to be open. It was indeed worthy of being an Immortal Elixir, just off awesome. The medicinal power of the Tai Purple Gold Pill was released in a short period, the effect was predictable, and the upper limit of Mana was raised significantly. Additionally, Luu had also enlisted in the essence of the Great Da, and his strength and realm were progressing by leaps and bounds. Marshal Da Jinan entered the level of five revolutions, equivalent to rapidly breaking through from a one-heavy domain to a five-heavy domain all at once. Additionally, Luu's Enlightenment had obviously improved a lot, which was the most important thing. Relative to this point, the increase in strength in the front was just an incidental effect. The natural Divine ability, Wind God Feather, was also completely mastered. It's not even an overstatement to describe the chain at this moment as being off the charts.

Will I be able to break through the ninth floor now? One try and you'll see. Without much thought, Luu got up and left the God Suppressing Dojo, heading in the direction of the Secret Realm of Trials. This time, when he took the Tai Purple Gold Pill and closed his mind to cultivate, not much time had passed. Only about ten days had passed before and after, and when Luu appeared on the ninth level of the Secret Realm of Trials again, the gatekeeper visibly froze for a moment, looking at Luu with some shock, almost thinking that he had blurred his eyes. However, even if the eyes are blurry, it's impossible to misperceive. So it's true; how long has it been? This little guy has actually gotten stronger. His strength was completely different compared to ten days ago. The gatekeeper looked at Luu in astonishment and couldn't help but ask, "How did you cultivate? How did you get so much stronger in a short period of time?" When Luu heard this, he smiled and said, "Because I'm a genius." Gatekeeper, if you count as a genius, what does that make the rest of the students at Blue Star University? Luu's natural talent was clearly no longer enough to be described by the word genius. Come on, let me see your progress. Within these ten days, the keeper snapped his fingers, and the world of flames quickly manifested. He knew how powerful Luu was, so he didn't dare to be careless and went all out. As soon as he came up, the Red Lotus of Hell spewed out from the magma and swooped down on Luu in an instant. When Luu broke through the ninth floor again, the news was causing quite a bit of concern. Many students, teachers, and even professors were a bit surprised that Luu couldn't

Waiting to break through the barrier again after only 10 days had passed, could it be that his strength had skyrocketed? Within these 10 days, how is this possible? Nope, it's still a real possibility. Too many miracles have happened to Luu, so it makes sense that this kind of insanity would be inflicted upon him. But here's the thing: even if his strength had improved, it would still be difficult to break through the ninth floor. That's what the vast majority of people think. Most students didn't spend credits to watch the breakout battle because they were already convinced it was a sure loss – nothing to see here. 

However, some older students and teachers don't care about the credits. Previously, there were some people who had missed the live stream of Luu's previous battle, so they couldn't miss it this time. There was no hesitation to spend credits and watch the live stream. The battle had only just begun, and everyone stared in disbelief.

As soon as he ascended to the ninth level, the Guardian was on fire, directly unleashing its ultimate move: Hell's Red Lotus. The moment the countless Red Lotus flames pounced on Luu, it seemed like a sure thing. As a result, countless strands of ghostly blue light suddenly appeared behind Luu's back, and those lights quickly formed a pair of feathered wings. Feathers lifting their wings, he flew. It was hardly flight; more like instantaneous transfer. Luu disappeared in place, and when he reappeared, he had already arrived high above the sky, where the Red Lotus flame was still burning.

"What a speed!" Everyone who saw this scene couldn't help but exclaim in shock. "That's a terrifying speed! Luu hadn't used it last time. Is this the latest technique cultivated in just 10 days? The junior Marshall Saint has cultivated such a powerful stance!" The pair of feathered wings in the picture was just too powerful, allowing Luu's speed to increase by leaps and bounds.

However, within the Nine Realms, attacks have a "sure hit" special effect. No matter where Luu dodged or fled, it would hit. As expected, the Red Lotus of Hell continued to spread and burn, and in just the twinkling of an eye, it filled the entire domain space. Facing the Red Lotus flame that filled the entire domain space, Luu simply swooped down, and the wind god feathered behind him spread out violently. All that followed was the sound of "Zip, Zip, Zip, Zip" – those feathered wings actually cut through the realm and swept through the cracks in space, not fearing the burning of the Red Lotus flame at all.

"No, can it still be...?" Seeing this scene, all the old students and teachers stared with wide eyes, all of them stunned. Even the guardian of the ninth floor did not expect Luu to have this move.

Between the flying shuttles, Luu had already gotten close, and without the slightest hesitation, he directly swung his sword and chopped out. Paul returned to the ruins. With this extremely close-range sword strike, the guardian could no longer resist and instantly turned into flying dust. The ninth pass was easily passed. At this point, the entire secret realm of Trials was considered to be cleared.

The sculpture-like Marshall ancestors suddenly sensed something. He raised his head and stared in dismay. "Actually, he let him break through the ninth floor? How many years has it been? How many years has it been since a student broke through the ninth floor? Haha! I didn't expect it, I really didn't expect it!" Without much thought, the Marshall ancestor immediately publicized this news. He had to irritate the guys who weren't trying hard enough.

For a moment, all the students, teachers, and professors of Blue Star Martial Arts University received an email at the same time. Chapter 212: An Email Causes a Stir at Blue Star University. Whether it was a new student or an old student, a teacher or a professor, at this moment, an email was received at the same time. The professors who were instructing martial arts, the students who were practicing, and the teachers who were discussing martial arts with each other all froze for a moment when they saw this email. "Are you sure this email was actually sent from Wuzu?" What happened? Surprisingly, this lord of the Trial Mystic Realm, the martial ancestor of the human race, owed to personally send an email to them? Without hesitation and with intense curiosity, this email was quickly opened.

It simply said: "Just now, freshman Luu has successfully broken through the ninth floor of the secret realm of Trials. He is the only one who has passed the secret realm of Trials among all the students and the only one who has passed the secret realm of Trials among all the freshmen. I hope that all of you will take this as an example and never forget your beginnings and continue to pursue the limits of martial arts."

The email was very simple, just these three lines of text, but the content of the email shocked everyone. "What? Little Marshall Saint passed the ninth floor? To have cleared the entire secret realm of Trials? While a student, only a Marshall Saint of that year could do it. Among the new students, there has never been such a feat against the heavens!"

Sya, who was practicing hard, couldn't help but marvel, "Little Luu, this is blue is better than blue!" Eugene sked in amazement. "This really let him pass the Trial Secret Realm." Many of the old professors rubbed their eyes, preferring to believe that their old eyes were blurred rather than believing that a new student could break through the ninth layer of the Trial Mystic Realm. This news... it's just crazy. Blue Star University Chancellor's office, Principal...

Here is the improved English text:

Fong Guang was discussing the recent annual appraisal matter with Vice Headmaster Chuan. Luu's name was inevitably mentioned during this time, as he was just too talented and attention-grabbing. He was the champion of the 10th Heavenly Pride battle, the founder of the martial art path of Ganan, and even his teachers recognized him as a martial ancestor. His strength was indeed terrifying, and he was able to fight with the Guardians of the ninth level of the Trial Mystic realm, making even the most difficult tests seem like child's play for him. His abilities made them wonder about the best way to harness his potential. Just then, an email was sent. When Fong Wang saw the initiator of the mass email, he found it a bit unbelievable. Without much thought, Fong Wang quickly looked at it. Vice Principal Chuan also looked up, and their expressions became quite astonishing. "This is breaking through the ninth level of the secret realm of Trials," Fong Wang said. He had witnessed Luu's breakthrough 10 days ago, and at that time, Luu had chopped off half of the guardian's body with a single sword, but there were actually quite a few gaps between them. If the gatekeeper had gone all out, the moment he came up, Luu wouldn't have even had the chance to make that divine beheading sword. Of course, to force out the hell Red Lotus of the ninth floor Guardian, Luu was already very powerful. Therefore, Fong Wang deduced that it would only take about half a year, at most, for Luu to break through the ninth layer. After Fong Wang finished reading this email, he turned his head to look at Vice Principal Chuan, and the two of them looked at each other for a long time before immediately pulling up the video of Luu's breakthrough. Soon, Luu's break-through screen appeared above the light screen. After seeing Luu's ease of movement and the ease of clearing the level without even using a single sword to decimate the god, the two of them were filled with shock in their eyes. "Ha! This broke through without a bloody battle," Fong Wang said. "How long has it been? This kid has reshown his skin again, just great!" Vice Principal Chuan couldn't help but spit out, "This is the ninth level of the secret realm of Trials, yeah, it's outrageous!" 

Lu Chan was talking to Bayu Ya in Marshal Saint's residence when Lu Chang's face stiffened. "What's wrong?" Bayu Ya asked curiously. Little Lu Changxang said with an odd expression on his face that Luu, his son, had actually broken through the ninth layer of the secret realm of trial so quickly. Bayu Ya was inevitably a bit surprised when she heard this. "Breaking through the ninth layer... I remember, the ninth layer is the ninth level of the domain... that's the gatekeeper's door, isn't it? Just a standard strength domain, 9." Lu Chang Shang nodded, and he said with some bitterness, "He's really worthy of being your son. He's actually even more powerful than I was back then." Bayu Ya said with a smile, "Yeah, he is." Lu Changxang said with some bitterness, "Why do you have this expression, Bayu Ya? You don't seem happy that he broke through the ninth floor. It's like this." Dash Lu longsaid simply, "When Bayu Ya heard this, she couldn't calm down and couldn't help but look at him angrily, "Are you going to kill my son? That's a pristine unexplored secret realm. Are you crazy or am I?" The Reincarnation Tower and the heavenly pride battle, although the competition is fierce, at least there won't be any worries about one's life. What is that, primordial secret realm? Even a martial Emperor going deeper has the probability of falling some particularly dangerous ancient relics. Even a 10th Marshall Saint like you has the probability of falling into them. Now you're actually planning to let him break into the taiway mysterious realm? No way, absolutely not. He's just too small. I wouldn't agree to that in the face of Bayu Ya's fierce opposition. Lu Changxang nodded and said calmly, "You're right, of course, there will be some dangers even if I carve a soul seal for him. There's a certain probability that something will go wrong, but the problem is, he's already a heavenly pride who can pass the ninth level of the trial Mystic realm. So how much longer are you going to shelter him? How will he grow up if he never lets go? His talent is above mine. Can you bear to see him be mediocre for the rest of his life?" The moment these words came out, Bayu Ya fell silent, and after a long time, she let out a helpless sigh. "Too soon, it's not that long ago that he was nestled in my arms. How long has it been, and he's already going solo? Time flies when you're having fun." 

Li Changxang heard this and smiled bitterly, and said, "It's really not that time has passed too quickly, but that this kid is too heaven-defying." University student Lu, who had just cleared the secret realm of Trials, didn't know what an uproar he had caused. He just felt extraordinarily free, and the effect of this innate divine ability, the wind god's feathered wings, was much better than he had expected. It was actually able to cut through the nine realms of space and fly through the gaps in space. If not for that, it would have been impossible for him to easily decimate the ninth-floor Guardian. "Definitely a lot more work," one could only say that it was truly worthy of being a talented Avatar.

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

That moment would reveal its importance only when Luu encountered the Tai purple gold pill. Then, a line of mission completion appeared before his eyes. Chapter 213, Stage One: Quest, Qualify for an Expedition to The Secret World was completed. Mission reward: Yuanling fruit has been issued. Scanning the text in front of him, Luu took another look at the details of the Quest reward. Fruit of the spirit rank seventh. Perfect type. Consumable effects. After taking it, it can rapidly enhance one's cultivation level.

The description of the treasure read like a Heaven and Earth rare treasure, naturally grown in the extreme North. Although its great was not too high, the energy was extremely pure. It was a rare and excellent treasure. Luu's face was calm, his eyes raised as he browsed through the description of the treasure in front of him. Ordinary seventh-rank Treasures no longer surprised him. This first phase of the mission was not too difficult, considering it was an introductory stage. Quest rewards given out were normally of a low grade. But even so, the Yuanling fruit was highly practical and very suitable for his current needs. Despite his strength having already stepped into the seventh realm and his cultivation level not yet reaching the peak of the fifth realm, there was a real need for Treasures like the Yuanling fruit. As the son of the Marshall Saint, Luu did not lack cultivation resources. And similar Treasures, there were quite a few. However, compared to these things rewarded by the system, the quality was obviously inferior.

After arriving at the Xin Shin Dojo, Luu ate the Yuanling fruit and closed his eyes to cultivate for a period of time. When he came out again, Luu's realm smoothly came to the late fifth realm. He couldn't help but say this Yuanling fruit was really effective, for it allowed him to reach the peak of the fifth realm more quickly than he had before. With his current strength, whether it was a sixth realm Grandmaster or a seventh realm Grandmaster, there was no longer a so-called threshold that existed. The only difficulty that persisted was the eighth realm Marshall King, which involved the power of rules. A few days later, Yao Guang Pavilion, the congregation, was hosting a sendoff party. Everyone looked at Luu reluctantly. Although everyone knew that with Big Brother's natural talent, he would definitely leave the Blue Star and make a name for himself soon. But no one expected the day to come when he would make this move so early.

"We'll see each other again at the banquet," Luu raised his wine glass and drank the milk inside, showing his heroic and selfless attitude. "I'm going here to open up the borders for the human race. This is my duty as the son of a Marshal Saint." Luu was somewhat touched as to see the unwilling gazes of the crowd. "There are some things that someone has to do," he said seriously. "I don't do it, who will do it?" Big Brother Xuang opened his mouth with red eyes. "Big Brother, I am also willing to go with you." Ing also spoke up. "Big Brother, take us there. We are willing to help." The crowd opened their mouths and scrambled to follow Luu to the Taiway Star Domain. Luu heard this, but he waved his hand helplessly. "Although I also can't bear to see you guys go," he said. "The Taiway Star Domain isn't as peaceful as this side of the Blue Star. It's very dangerous. With the invasion of foreign races, civil unrest, large-scale interstellar wars, and all sorts of dangerous situations occurring frequently, how can I bear to see you guys step into the sea of fire?" Moreover, you are still too young to grow up now. "After all, later on when you grow up a bit and become stronger, you'll naturally be able to come with me to the Taiway Astral Domain." He recognized his status as elder brother to them, so they should listen to him. The crowd was silent as they listened to these words, each looking at Luu with reluctance. It was a scene that was both touching and a little funny at the same time. Outside of Yao Gang Pavilion, Chuan Hong looked at her own foolish son's silly appearance and couldn't help but cover her face. Her heart was helpless. "This foolish son of his own family" had been completely bowled over by Lu Ching's son. Chuan Hong was strongly opposed, simply did not want to follow Chuang's nonsense. But then, after calming down and thinking about it, she felt that this matter was not that simple. Knowing that Luu had won the championship of the 10,000 races, Heaven's Pride battle, and obtained the largest strand of the flame of civilization, he would surely receive a revelation from the flame of civilization. But when he came back, the Marshall Saint made no more than a couple of minor moves. They were mostly reserved for the minor Marshall Saint, just pulling a bunch of kids to invest.

In the Taiway Starfield, Chuan Hong's thoughts were pondered more deeply, as the matter at hand was of great importance. However, he did not act impulsively but decided to try his luck with Ling first, only to receive no response. After days of contemplation, Chuan Hong found himself torn between gambling or not. Eventually, he decided to gamble, withdrawing the majority of his family's fortune. He fully supported Little Marshall Saint, providing people, money, supplies, and weapons without expecting anything in return, and also planned to remodel the Taiway Starfield in all aspects.

The news of Chuan Hong's decision caused a stir within the Chu family. Many members felt that the family head had lost his mind, following a small child's whims. Each and every one of them objected strongly, but Chuan Hong's mind was made up. He was determined to have his way.

After Marshall St. Lu Chang learned about this, he was not surprised and did not oppose it. Instead, he said in a salty manner that he could let Chuan Hong invest in it. This subtle attitude made Chuan Hong a little surprised and more certain of one thing: the revelation of the flame of civilization was more than likely in the Taiway Starfield. This investment of his, which nearly depleted his family's wealth, should not be bloodless.

Luu took the S-Class ship Polaris and rushed to the Taiway star domain. It was only then that Marshall St. Lu Chang revealed that the revelation of the flame of civilization was somewhere in the Taiway star domain. It was impossible to hide such a big event, so it might as well be published news.

A moment later, an unknown number of people almost slapped their thighs. Previously, their son had approached them to pull in investments, asking them to support the little Marshall Saint by contributing people, money, and effort to remodel the 138 living planets in the Taiway astral domain. This "doomed blood money" business naturally had its share of reluctant investors, even if they felt that this matter may not be simple. However, the situation was now announced that the place of the revelation of the civilizational fire was in the Taiway Starfield. This was roughly equivalent to advanced notice to buy the impending demolition of the house, but people were too afraid to go buy, thinking there might be fraud involved. The result of the turn of events was that many people missed out, and it was too late to catch up.

Chapter 214: The Outpost is about to fall. The Polaris spacecraft flew with a larger group, gradually accelerating to the speed of light before embarking on a cosmic shuttle. The next 12 days of flight through the Wormhole would be required to reach the Taiway Starfield, 12 million light years away. No matter how many times he had made a cosmic flight, Luu still couldn't help but lament the vastness of the universe. According to Lu Chang's narration, the scope of existence of the universal 10,000 races was merely the tip of the iceberg of the observable universe. It is still unknown how many powerful communities there are beyond the observable universe, beyond that impenetrable cosmic wall. The stars and the universe are fascinating, isn't it?

Beside Luu, Marshall Emperor Hong asked with a smile. He was one of the Disciples of Luu's old man and was also the chief person in charge of this Taiway mysterious Realm. Luu had met with him a few times during the New Year. Luu nodded and said with emotion, "No matter how many times I've come to the universe, all the images in front of me still fascinate me. Haha, Hunza said with a smile. Master used to say that endless mysteries, endless unknowns, this is the nature of the universe. It's possible that outside of the cosmic 10,000 races, the 10th realm isn't the limit. There might be an 11th realm, a 12th realm. It's all possible. Master also said that there is a great possibility that there are other universes outside of this universe, like galaxies in the universe, and that there may be countless unknown universes suspended beyond ours. The universe is so big and mysterious that anything can happen."

When Luu heard these words, it was inevitable that his heart would yearn for them. If we go by pops, not to mention the human community, even the 10,000 races of the universe are just a drop in the ocean. This is just so shocking. Luu was a little heartbroken. I wonder if one day he will be able to see the Wider World.

Hong laughed and continued, "I think that what Master is saying is that no matter how impressive the achievements are compared to the entire universe, we're still not worth mentioning at all. So, at all times, keep a humble heart."

Luu came back to his senses when he heard this. I see. Hong laughed as he continued, "Let me roughly talk to you about the situation of the Taiway astral domain as well as the specifics of the Taiway secret realm." Trouble Lou nodded. The Taiway Starfield spans to 1 million light years. It's a very vast and very barren Starfield with only 120 or so living planets and not many mineral planets that can be mined either. It's a completely worthless waste planet or it's a garbage planet with only a little bit of value that's not worth the cost of mining, however, despite the fact that 120 or so living planets are not many, the Taiway Starfield is still a valuable asset.

In this Starfield, there are no available planets; however, it borders the starfields occupied by the nefarious God Clan, the Holy Spirit Clan, and the Blood Moon Clan. Each of these powerful clans resides in a place where soldiers must engage in battle, and it cannot be easily discarded. Otherwise, our human race would be invaded by foreign races.

Many astrologists had previously speculated that the Taiway Starfield was so vast that it could not be worthless. They believed that where the major star veins were located, there was likely a secret realm hidden. However, despite numerous attempts to locate it, the secret realm remained elusive, and the matter was gradually forgotten.

That is until you won the champion of the 10,000 races Heaven's Pride battle, and through the revelation of the flame of civilization, we managed to open the door to that secret realm. You are indeed a credit to our human race, Hunza smiled and patted Lu U's tiny shoulder before continuing.

The Taiway secret realm is estimated to be a staggering 2.8 light-years in diameter. Luu couldn't help but smack his lips when he heard this. The second stage of the mission is to explore 1% of the secret area and bring back treasures of equal value. However, exploring a secret place that is a full 2.8 light-years away is no easy feat. The diameter of the solar system is only 0.003 light-years, and Luu could not have explored even 1% of the range even if he explored until he died.

The Taiway secret realm is considered to be the largest known secret realm within the human race. Currently, known secret realms are roughly categorized into three types: naturally occurring secret realms, secret realms that have been transformed into a world through a domain, and artificially transformed natural secret realms. The Taiway secret realm is the third type, an artificially modified natural secret realm that is large in scope but mostly a voidland. There are only nine indigenous civilizations in there, and we have set up an outpost in one of them.

The next plan is to expand into a frontline military base and get a complete foothold in one of the civilizations. However, the rules of the world are completely different, and it is difficult for our human race's technological weapons such as the Star Destroyer Cannon to get over there and use them. It is also difficult for Marshall King realm and Marshall Emperor realm powerhouses to enter in a short period of time. One must fully adapt to the secret realm rules before entering.

In short, inside the current secret realm, the strongest in our human team is just the peak of the seventh realm. This is arguably the toughest phase, and the outpost could be discovered and overrun at any time. Once you enter the secret realm, you'll have to fend for yourself because no strong person can protect you.

Twelve days passed in the blink of an eye, and when the ship left the Wormhole, it had come to the vicinity of the Taiway secret realm. Through the window of the spaceship, it was possible to see a super military fortress like a mechanical planet suspended in the starry sky. The airship soon docked in the aerodrome of the military fortress.

Just after getting off the airship, someone flew over and reported the latest news to Hunza Commander Hong. The outpost has suffered heavy casualties, and the situation is critical and about to fall. The human outpost is in critical condition with heavy casualties and is about to fall. Hunza furrowed his brows and immediately asked what the casualties were and what the enemy numbers were. According to the news coming from the secret realm, more than 10,000 martial artists stationed at the outpost are currently half-dead or injured. The person reporting the news spoke extremely fast, just 12 hours ago, the Holy Realm civilization that the outpost was stationed in sent at least 200,000 troops to surround it.

Upon hearing this, Huang Zun nodded and quickly ordered the deployment of support troops. Only after making arrangements did he look at Luo. The situation at the front line is unclear, so you won't be able to enter the secret realm for at least a few more months, he said.

Luu looked up at Huang and said seriously, "I want to go over to support." At these words, Huang furrowed his brows and shook his head. "I'm sorry, that's not possible. The situation is critical now. If you go over, it's almost no different from sending someone to their death. There's no way I'm going to allow you to go over there. There's no room for negotiation."

Since Luu had come to the front, he would have to follow Huang's orders. But Luu insisted, "If I don't dare to go over there because the situation is dangerous, then what's the point of me coming over here?"

Hearing this, many people around them looked at Luu in surprise. Even without introducing himself, Luu was still recognized. He had too many names that were too loud, and it was hard not to recognize him. No one had expected that the little Marshal Saint would actually come to the Taiway Star Domain and dare to go to the secret realm for support. He was so brave, but the situation over there was very dangerous. Even the peak of the seventh realm could fall at any time. Although Luu was powerful and had won the 10,000 Heaven's Pride battle not long ago, he was only at the fifth realm. Just like Huang had said, there was no difference between going over there and sending them to their deaths.

"No means no," Huang said, sounding somewhat helpless. Even if it was the same adventure, there was still a difference if Luu went over there now. He would be practically looking for death.

"Don't worry, I won't die that easily," Luu reassured him. Huang didn't want to talk about this nonsense with Luu anymore, but just then, Luu touched his forehead, and with the injection of energy, the soul mark left behind by Lu Chang Ching slightly revealed a hint.

If anything, Huang was just about to arrange for Luu to join the support unit when he suddenly felt that familiar aura in the center of his brow. His eyes slowly widened. Could it be that Master had predicted in advance that there would be problems at the outpost and let Luu come over with this soul seal to support? That was timely. The outpost was about to fall, and as the commander-in-chief, Huang naturally had a headache. But he had to force himself to act calm. If he panicked, then the others would naturally panic even more. So even if it was hard, he had to play it cool.

Originally, Huang was still in a headache, but then he figured it out. He smiled faintly and said to Luu, "Since you want to go over to support, then follow the support unit over. Go to formation 019. Shiao Pan, take him over there."

"Yes, Aitan Pan Wiow," immediately answered. It was only after Luu left that the surrounding crowd reacted. Each one of them suddenly stared with white eyes, unable to believe that Huang had actually agreed.

"What's wrong with that?" someone asked. "If something goes wrong, who's responsible?"

"Crazy, crazy. Are you Huntsman crazy, or are we crazy?" a Marshall King raised an objection, but it was countered back by Huang.

"Don't worry, there won't be any problems," Huang said, smiling.

"This Marshall King stared with white eyes, really not understanding the source of Huang's confidence. How could there not be problems? "Are you crazy, Huntsman?" he asked.

Huang smiled and asked rhetorically, "Do you know about soul seals?"

The Marshall King froze. Yes, an existence at the 10th realm level would have many special abilities, and the soul seal was one of them.

Huang nodded and explained, "Leave the soul seal on the body of the descendant. Set the trigger conditions, such as when life and death are in danger. The soul seal will be stimulated once inspired. Once inspired, the soul seal will transform into a doppelganger whose strength is close to that of the main body. Although there will be a certain time limit, it is still a 10th realm doppelganger, and its strength is still incomparably terrifying. It can flatten all powerful enemies in a short period of time."

Hearing this, the Marshall King finally understood the source of Huang's confidence. In that case, there really wasn't any problem at all with having Luu support the outpost. Just by encountering a life and death crisis, Lu Chongqing's doppelganger would manifest. No matter how many armies the sanctuary civilization sent out and how strong the generals were in front of Lu Chang xiang, they would all be drags. A direct horizontal push would be the end of the matter. In a primordial secret realm like this, the strongest existences were only at the peak of the ninth realm. Even if there was a time limit and the battle power was far inferior to that of the main body, that was after all a 10th realm doppelganger. It simply couldn't be compared to anything else.

This text describes a situation where a group of individuals are discussing the value and limitations of a Soul Seal in a fantastical realm. Yone laments the scarcity of these Soul Seals and how fortunate it is for them to have one. Hong explains that even powerful Masters would bear a great price to carve a Soul Seal, and most ancient gods from foreign races don't have the power to part with theirs.

Lu Chang Xing receives a communication call from Hza, who informs him about a troubling matter. Lu Chang Xing's face becomes odd upon hearing the news, as he hadn't expected such a problem so soon after Lu's arrival.

Seventh realm Grandmaster Shan Leu assures Lu that he will be protected, even if it means putting his life on the line. Lu's status is honorable, and the group is determined to keep him safe despite the risks. Some great Patriarchs are displeased with Lu's actions, considering this a life-or-death battlefield rather than a casual outing.

Lu smiles and reciprocates the group's protection, promising to protect them as well. Although they don't take his words literally, they acknowledge Lu's strength and potential. The group enters a secret realm, feeling an uncomfortable, indescribable sensation. Yo Foone explains that this feeling will disappear once the realm is fully developed. The transport ship continues its journey through the peculiar Starry Sky.

In this strange universe, a sudden continent appeared in front of them. It wasn't a planet, but a continent with a round sky. Seeing this scene, Luu's eyes widened in surprise. At the end of the continent, oceans rushed down, flowing through an endless cliff into the endless void. The scene was spectacular, fantastic, and magical.
Beside Luu, the Army Chief, who hadn't said anything, suddenly opened his eyes and stared at the distant continent. He said earnestly, "Everyone, get ready for the upcoming landing on the Divine Ruins Continent."
Before coming here, Luu had roughly understood the basic information about the Divine Ruins Continent. There were a total of three civilizations: Sanctuary Civilization, Immortal Feather Civilization, and Ancient Market Civilization. These three great secret realm civilizations were at odds with each other, and the wars hardly ever stopped. In addition to these three major civilizations, there were also six secret civilizations that weren't in the Divine Ruins Continent but were in another place.
The fleet reoriented itself and swooped downward, about to enter this mysterious continent. They communicated down that they would be arriving at the Divine Ruins Continent in 3 minutes and that they would be arriving at The Outpost position in 30 minutes. A battle could break out at any moment, so everyone should prepare for battle. Repeat: a battle may occur at any time, be ready to fight.
Legion Commander Shha said loudly with his communication device. Listening to the words of the Army Chief, around Luu, all the Seven Realms Grand Masters began to prepare their combat equipment and weapons. The atmosphere, which had been quite pleasant, instantly became tense.
Luu thought that he might be a touch scared, might be a touch fearful, might be a touch regretful, but as it turned out, it didn't. Not to mention fear or fear, Luu was even a little excited, a little inexplicably excited. It's like an eagle taking flight for the first time, feeling the vastness of Heaven and Earth again. It's like a fish in a fishbowl flopping in a river or lake for the first time, a very wonderful feeling quickly roamed his heart, causing Luu's eyes to become extraordinarily bright.
Fighting, he was very much looking forward to the next fight. Beside Luu, Jean Leu was just about to comfort him when he suddenly sought his leaping eyes and froze. A fledgling eagle who has never been on an interstellar battlefield, a genius who has never experienced life and death adventures, and who is about to rush to the front line at this moment can be the least bit fearful.
Chapter 217: L's True Strength

There are some people who are born to fight on the battlefield. Inexplicably, Jean Leu thought of these words. It was something the company commander had said to himself alone long ago when he was a new recruit. He had since seen similar expressions on the faces of many army chiefs and generals. Who would have thought it's amazing to see it on a child's face? At the moment, it's so newborn. Most technological weapons can't be used because of the different rules, but it's good to know that special communication devices aren't affected by The Secret World.
At the moment, Legion Commander Sher how was giving the battle plan. Each formation had a mission. For example, formation 019, including Luu, had a total of 67 realm warriors, 456 realm warriors, and 455 realm warriors in the army of men. As soon as you reach the fifth realm, you earn the title of Lieutenant. Usually, a second lieutenant advances to Lieutenant and Captain. However, usually by the time you reach the captain, you've basically broken through to the sixth realm. Sixth realms that have accumulated enough military merit are even able to obtain the title of school officer, which is Major. However, among the school officials, most of them were mainly seventh realm martial artists. The titles are mostly Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel. As for the rank of Major or even Major General, the military service is an astronomical figure, and there are also requirements for the realm, at least to break through to the eighth realm.
This time, there were no eighth realm powerhouses in the support force because of the rule restrictions and because of the limitations on the number of people who could enter. Every single one of the support ones that came in was the elite of the elite. However, even with such an Elite Force, this line was still a bad one because what the crowd was fighting against was an entire civilization.
Commander Shha's team hadn't contacted Outpost 001 yet. He needed to know the battle situation over there. By all means, contact me within 3 minutes, Legion Commander Sher how roared in anger. The situation was a bit out of his prediction. Obviously, he had already entered the Divine Ruins Continent and reached the contact range of the instant messaging.

He couldn't contact The Outpost, and that gave him a bad feeling. Was The Outpost all but wiped out, or was the enemy forcing them into an even more grueling, scorching slog? Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The fleet's energy shield was instantly hit by countless attacks and shattered. Before the alternate shield could open, the next wave of attacks had already arrived. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Enemy attack! Enemy attack! What was the scouting squad doing? This wasn't detected. Legion Commander Sh How's eyes widened as he couldn't help but curse. "Our detection instruments didn't work. The enemy is perfectly hidden." The captain of the detection squad immediately said. 18.9% of the fleet's ships were damaged in that wave of attacks, reducing speed by 83%. The engines were severely damaged. The captain of the piloting squad reported. 179 people died in that wave of attacks, all fifth realm igns. The leader of the medical squad reported that 383 people were seriously injured, requiring prompt treatment. The enemy was the elite forces of the Sanctuary civilization, numbering around 100,000 at the very least. The rest of the configuration was unknown for now. The captain of the intelligence squad spoke extremely fast. These reports came in almost simultaneously, and Legion Commander Sh How made an instant judgment. "We can't rush through. Open the backup shield immediately. The medical team will treat the wounded, and the rest of you will leave the barn and fight. Follow the original battle plan." "Brothers, the time has come to kill the enemy and make a mark." Legion Commander Sheral laughed loudly. "Let this group of natives of the secret realm see the power of our human martial artists." His voice resounded throughout the fleet, and everyone heard these inspiring words from the Army Chief Sh How. The original panic quickly dissipated, replaced by the courage to fight and kill. Human martial artists never shy away from battle. In the Star Wars era, there were usually two types of combat. First, the use of technological weapons to assist in combat. While most technological weapons were hardly effective against alien races above the sixth realm, they were still quite good for assisting in combat. Some high-energy weapons, such as the Star Destroyer cannon, were even more effective. At the seventh realm, even the eighth realm couldn't resist them head-on, and using them at a critical moment often had a miraculous effect. Unfortunately, due to the special rules of the secret realms, almost all technological weapons could not be used. At this moment, only the second method could be used: forming a formation to charge into battle. When Luu left the airship with the 019 formation, he immediately saw a sky full of alien races, almost impossible to see the end of. The body of their leader revealed an extremely terrifying aura. He was an eight-realm powerhouse, a solid ethereal realm power, wearing golden armor that looked extremely dazzling under the sunlight. He raised his golden greatsword and shouted, "When you die, your souls will return to the kingdom of God. The god king will grant eternal life to all the valiant and fearless. On my command, charge! Kill all the foreigners! Not a single one left!" Although Luu couldn't understand what this foreigner was saying, he didn't need to understand at all. The war had begun, and the great battle was imminent. An army of 100,000 foreigners surrounded all the human support forces, trying to keep everyone here. The ethereal realm powerhouse at the head of the group even intended to charge recklessly and disrupt the formation of the human army. At the critical moment, Legion Commander Shha stepped forward and pestered this eight-realm powerhouse. Although Shha was at the peak of the seventh realm, he had already mastered the power of rules long ago. His strength was extraordinary, and fighting across levels was not a problem at all. On the other side of the battlefield, Luu took the lead. The wind god's feather wings behind him violently opened up, easily cutting through the joint domain of the three enemy seventh-realm powerhouses. Then, like a stream of light, he swiftly skinned through the gaps in the domain space. Facing these foreigners, Luu did not hesitate for a second and directly swung his sword, Paul, returning to the ruins. His sword chopped away, carrying a sword light that seemed to be able to destroy everything. The 37th-realm foreigner powerhouses were not even a match for Luu. With a perfect set of supreme treasures, heavy treasures, and secret treasures, Luu's terrifying melee ability of the Way of Fleshly Sainthood could be utilized to the extreme. Even if it was 37th-realm foreigner powerhouses in front of him, they were still like dirt chickens and dogs, unbeatable. The field was like a dream bubble, instantly dissipating. Several seventh-realm foreigners just disappeared into thin air, as if they had never existed. Looking at the image in front of him, Jan Leu's jaw dropped, and he couldn't believe his eyes. For a moment, this... This chapter 218: Killing the enemy, capturing the treasure. Cool under the sword light that could almost destroy everything, the 37th-realm powerhouses of the Sanctuary civilization instantly fell. They didn't even put up token resistance. Luu's sword was just too fast and fierce. Not to mention that they didn't react. Even Jan Leu, the captain of the 019 formation, didn't react.

By the time Luu reacted, the sword had already cut through, vaporizing the three powerful enemies from the Seventh Realm who stood before him. J Le, who had just opened his mouth to tell Luu not to be reckless and return quickly, stared with wide eyes for a moment, speechless. He then swore to Luu, "I will protect you, even if it means fighting with my life."

In J Le's opinion, even though Luu was more talented and powerful, he was still ultimately a Heavenly Pride who had never seen a battlefield and whose realm was only the Fifth Realm. Even with a bright future, he would still need time to grow. In the end, J Le knew very well that Luu's future was incomparable to theirs, but for now, it was the responsibility of the older generation of martial artists to protect him.

However, he was thinking too much. The war had just begun, and Luu had already killed three Seventh Realm foreigners with a single sword strike. It was so fierce and powerful, it defied logic. Despite the shock, J Le, as a battlefield veteran, quickly accepted this fact. He turned to the crowd of the 019th formation and said with a big smile, "Brothers, the Little Marshall Saint has already made his mark. How can we lag behind? Charge with me!"

Although the crowd of the 09th formation was shocked by the scene before them, they quickly reacted. One by one, their blood rushed, and they shouted in unison, "Kill!"

Two lines of prompts immediately appeared on the military merit recording device Luu was carrying: "You have killed three Seventh Realm foreigners. You have earned 30,000 military merit points and 30,000 contribution value. Your rank has been raised to Major."

The military merit gained from killing Seventh Realm foreign races was incredibly high, a staggering 30,000 points. This allowed Luu's rank to jump three levels, from Lieutenant to Major in one breath, skipping over the titles of Lieutenant and Captain. This rate of promotion was truly outrageous. For most ordinary second lieutenants, it might take more than 10 years of accumulated military service to be promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant. Even some of the fastest promotions would take a year or two to go from second lieutenant to lieutenant. But this was nothing to Luu. He had killed three Seventh Realm foreigners as soon as he arrived. How could he not be promoted?

Even with other Fifth Realm individuals, crossing realms to kill the enemy was a significant feat. He had directly crossed two great realms. It was like a low-level player in a game directly defeating a high-level boss, gaining a massive amount of experience. It would be strange if his level didn't skyrocket.

At this moment, when he beheaded the three Seventh Realm foreigners, not only were the others shocked, but he himself was a bit surprised. "At least it's a Seventh Realm powerhouse, how can it be so weak?" Luu couldn't help but mutter.

One must know that he was only at the Fifth Realm now, and there was a huge gap in energy between him and a Seventh Realm powerhouse, a difference of two great realms. Even so, he had finished the kill with ease. Perhaps it wasn't that the Seventh Realm foreigner was too weak, but that his current self was too strong.

With these days of cultivation, Luu had become a little stronger than he was when he had broken through the ninth level of the Trial Mystic Realm. His control over the natural Divine ability, Wind God Feathered Wings, was also getting more and more refined.

Time seemed to fly by as Luu swept a glance at the place where the three Seventh Realm powerhouses had fallen. Without much thought, with a sweep of his divine thoughts, the treasures and weapons dropped by the Seventh Realm powerhouses were all included in Luu's Shan'u and Treasure Pearl.

These treasures and weapons, slightly broken but not completely destroyed, were obviously all rare secret treasures or even heavy treasures. In that case, they must be collected. The Shan'u and Treasure Pearl had a huge holding space, claiming to be able to hold mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans. In the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle before this, even if they killed their opponents, they could not obtain their opponent's treasures, and they were not useful at all. But now it was different. This was a real battlefield fight. As long as you finished off your opponent, you could take their treasures and pocket them all. Especially after beheading an opponent alone, the loot on the opposite side all belonged to the individual, as written in the laws of the human race. At this moment, Luu's inclusion of these treasures in his pocket could be considered logical and without a single problem.

These treasures and weapons, even if they were slightly damaged, were after all Seventh Rank Treasures. Individual values at least were in the hundreds to tens of billions of star dollars. The equipment and treasures of the three Seventh Realm powerhouses combined were close to 100 billion star dollars. There was no doubt that this was a windfall.

Seizing these treasures would be no small feat after Luu had placed so many treasures in the depths of the Shin Jin Treasure Pearl, the blue wind God's feathered wings swooped in behind Luu's back with violent force, and he vanished once again. However, when he reappeared, he had already caught up with the 37th realm foreigners behind. He was like the goddess of death, harvesting lives without hesitation, as he swung his sword and beheaded Pau. Returning to the ruins, Luu swung his sword and beheaded another seventh realm foreigner; as for the other three seventh realm foreign races, they reacted too slowly, for the 37th realm powerhouses were annihilated in an instant. After their treasures fell to the ground, Luu extended his hand and wrapped it around them, gathering all their treasures into the Chinu and treasure Pearl. With his wings uplifted and speed surging, Luu disappeared once again; this process was incredibly swift - from the moment Luu appeared and beheaded the aliens to the moment he gathered the treasures and fled, the entire process did not take more than a second.

The sudden emergence and swift kill of the seventh realm foreigners were a sight to behold; it was like watching a flash of lightning on a clear day. The group of people from the Lost Arc were baffled, unable to grasp what they were witnessing. Captain Yang Za Kahi, who had been battling the alien races, suddenly encountered this scene and was taken aback; his eyes widened in wonder - "What kind of situation has come to pass? His skills are incredible, striking out and killing multiple seventh realm foreigners in an instant."

Za Kahi blinked, taking a moment to accept the reality of the situation; for those who have been on the battlefield for a long time, their perception and reaction time don't falter. Za Kahi immediately exclaimed, "Junior Marshall Saint, you have decimated the opponent's seventh realm forces! Their formation is no longer cohesive; we must charge at once. There is no doubt about it - the morale of our 011 formation is high!"

On the other side, there was the team from the Sanctuary Civilization. They were watching this scene unfold with a sense of horror - within a matter of seconds, three of their top seven realm leaders were brutally killed. Seventh realm powers are extremely formidable, and it's unbearable to watch them be slaughtered mercilessly.

The eighth realm powerhouse was shocked; they chose to accept their fate and gather together to hold off against Luu, sacrificing the advantage of the front battlefield in order to survive. They grouped together, huddling close, and prayed that the eighth realm powerhouse would help them find a solution to this predicament; if they didn't, this battle would undoubtedly be lost.

However, the seven realm powers, realizing their scalps were numb and trembling with fear, couldn't bear to face the situation. They decided to take cover behind Luu, the monstrous assassin; his speed was a problem they couldn't tackle, for they were too scared to face the sword.

Earlier, they had thought of setting up an ambush to prevent Luu from sneaking up on them, but their plan backfired when they realized they couldn't control him. They were in awe of Luu's unparalleled speed, even when augmented with the double enhancement of the white Jade Wind and Fire will plus Wind God feathered Wings. Those domains who tried to take him down were swept aside with ease.

The most difficult truth for them to accept was that the assassin on the other side was only a mere fifth realm foreigner, who was no match for the seventh realm powers in terms of strength. It was as if they thought it was a camouflage produced by a special treasure, a plot by a madman of genius, that Luu's level had completely and utterly surpassed their imagination.

Starting to group together to hold off against Luu without disrupting themselves and abandoning their formation just to defend themselves, Luu almost smiled - powerful people of the Holy realm civilization knew how to make difficult decisions, weighing the pros and cons, and accepting that sacrificing the front battlefield might be the only survival chance.

Luu glanced at the military records; after killing 147 enemy forces, he gained 140,000 military contributions, worth 140,000 contribution points, which upgraded him from major to lieutenant colonel - not far from colonel. The promotion speed was "frightening." 

Luu wasn't entirely satisfied; however, he knew he could have achieved colonel within a shorter period, but the other side had to give him a chance. Reflecting for a moment, Luu still had a glint in his eyes, showing that he would have to fight to be promoted further.

Here is the text with the English improved while maintaining the original meaning:

At the peak of the seventh realm, his strength was as if he already possessed the eighth realm's power. LAYAN felt humiliated, for the seventh realm could actually fight with itself. Just then, LAYAN heard a call for help and turned his head to look at it, and his eyes widened in surprise. "What's going on here?" he wondered. The number of seventh realm powerhouses under his command plummeted with the deaths of these seventh realm powerhouses, and the originally victorious situation gradually tilted towards the human race. Aside, devil assassin LEWAN's eyes widened, and his gaze quickly caught LUU. "It's him," Lewan exclaimed. "It's him." In this instant, LAYAN couldn't wait to grab LUU and then ruthlessly squeeze him to death. "Legion Commander, SHAH," followed Lew's gaze, and naturally saw the scene. His eyes widened in some surprise before he couldn't help but let out a loud laugh. "Hahaha! Bravo, little Marshall Saint! If you win this battle, you should be the honorable head." Even though he didn't understand the language, LAYAN still understood. "Then I'll kill you first," he let out a cold laugh. Then, he dodged out of the frontal Battlefield and directly killed towards LUU with the help of the power of the rules. The terror of LAYWIN speed was not even below LUU's; in fact, it was even better. An eighth realm powerhouse was terrifying, and not good for Legionnaire SH. How glared and rushed to catch up, although they were equal in terms of battle power. The seventh realm was after all the seventh realm, and even if they were equal in terms of battle power, they were still slightly inferior in terms of speed at this moment. Even though his reaction was fast enough, he was still too late to catch up. SHAU's eyes widened a little anxiously, as little Marshall Saint "J. L." couldn't help but exclaim in shock when he saw the scene. "Little Marshall Saint, be careful," the captains of the other formation shouted on the other side.

The seventh realm Powerhouse of the sanctuary civilization couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief when he saw the scene. "Kill him, great General Raven. He's dead, haha. Go to hell." If LUU didn't die, the five Realms simply didn't dare to continue fighting. Although LUU killed one seventh-round fellow dog-like, compared to the eighth realm, there was obviously still a significant gap. At this moment, when LAYAN stared at him, the hairs on his body stood up. He was originally still considering how to decapitate those hugging seventh realm who would have thought that, in a turn of an eye, the strong eighth realm on the opposite side of the world directly made him anxious eyes seethe. The eight Realms bully the five Realms; there's no mistaking it. LUU didn't hesitate. With a flick of his wings behind him, he instantly disappeared in place. LAYAN's original speed advantage was clearly not enough in front of this eighth realm powerhouse. It's only the fifth realm, but you can actually easily decimate the seventh realm. I'm afraid a Supreme Genius like you is few and far between in your civilization. LAYAN stared at him, shocked and delighted for a moment. "Don't worry, I won't kill you, GD." In this instant, he changed his mind. Instead of killing LUU, he captured him back, so that he could tell these people to throw in the towel and say, in the meantime, he could also study this Super Genius under the power of the rules.

LUU understood the words of the eighth realm powerhouse on the opposite side, his mind was in a trance, and even his speed slowed down, which was also a spiritual attack from the power of rules. Compared to an ordinary seventh realm, an eighth realm Powerhouse had too many means, however, at the same time, inside LUU's body that Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul suppressor Stone slowly rotated suppressing all of these spiritual attacks. All of them. LUU's eyes instantly became clear, seeing this scene. LAYAN was delighted, instead of shocked. "Actually, there's Treasures to protect your soul. Your identity must be particularly honorable." EARNED IT. Chapter 220: Breaking through the six Realms. Sense the rules. No doubt about it; it's a life and death crisis.

At LUU's forehead, the soul Mark left by LU changin was slightly hot and was already in a state of being triggered at any time. However, LUU did not want this Soul seal to trigger once the soul seal is triggered, this adventure is over. LUU narrowed his eyes and quickly analyzed the situation at hand. Instantly, coming to a conclusion. If it was in a straight line speed, he would not be able to compare to the opposing eighth realm Powerhouse and would be caught up immediately. So, here's the question. What if it's not a straight line? The thought flashed without the slightest hesitation. LUU revived his wings and the white Jade Wind and Fire wheels under his feet spun madly, few only to see LUU Nimble steering in mid-air coming up with a perfect drift and flying directly in the other direction. The speed was barely reduced by much as for the opposing eighth realm Powerhouse he obviously couldn't do this. In the instant he turned direction, his speed directly plummeted. The distance was immediately opened up by this contrast. LAYAN, who had already won the battle and was about to catch LUU, furrowed his brows and cursed with some annoyance. "Damn little rat. Still, really knows how to run." LUU laughed. However, his speculation had been right. This tenth realm not a particularly strong eighth realm, only had an advantage in terms of straight line speed, and as far as stance was concerned, it was clearly inferior to his natural Divine ability. Wind god-feathered wings, plus the augmentation of the Supreme treasure.

White Jade, the Wind and Fire Wheel, turned and scoffed, coming on so strong and so terrifyingly. It was foolish, Le thought, when these words came out, although he couldn't understand them. He understood Luu's expression as well as the tone of these words, and he couldn't help but become even more annoyed. I'll see where you can escape to, he retorted.

Luu had the advantage in terms of stance, but he could still catch him if given enough time. However, it was clear that Raven didn't have the time at this moment. The Human Army Chief, though late, had arrived, and the rule in his hand was like thunder and lightning, stabbing down instantly. Boom! The eighth Rome Powerhouse lay one was directly hit and directly injured.

Raven was furious immediately, and it erupted with a might as great as a mountain and a sea. Little Marshall Saint Retreat farther, Legion Commander shouted, crossing in front of Luu, blocking the might. He stared at Leyan dead in the face and licked his lips. Decapitated in the eighth realm is very Troublesome, he said, he's sustained by the forces of the rules, and it's simply not possible to kill him without breaking these forces of the rules. It's going to be a constant battle.

Luu was also clear that his current self could not join the battle, so he did not add to the chaos and immediately dashed away. Sher House's gaze that was looking at prey Leyan asked with some annoyance, "Air seventh realm, you think you can kill me? It's just the eighth realm, it's not like I haven't killed before." Sher House smiled faintly as the Army chief of this support team. His strength naturally was extraordinary, and his past battle records could be described as exceptionally brilliant. He is also the only major title holder in this support unit under the influence of the power of the rules.

Even though the languages were incompatible at this moment, each other could understand what the other was saying. Leyan couldn't help but be a little surprised. He was clear that this guy across from him wasn't lying. He was afraid that he had really killed an eighth realm warrior. "I'd like to see how you're going to kill me," Leyan smiled coldly.

Sher How laughed loudly, carrying the rule Lance in his hand, and killing the big battle was imminent. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Just the aftermath of the battle left Luu the figure a little unsteady. If Sher Howen Lean had not intentionally controlled the scope of the battle, I am afraid that countless people would have been mistakenly injured on this battlefield. Luu just glanced at it and stopped looking at it. He was clear that his current self was not even close.

Luu's gaze swept towards the Group of Seven Realms foreigners not far away. These seventh realm powerhouses, feeling Luu's gaze, could not help but feel a chill down their backs. Just now, General Leyan of the eighth realm had struck out, and he hadn't even been able to kill this guy. This guy's speed was just terrifying. "As long as we hold together, that guy can't kill us even if he's good. He's just going to take them one by one. We just don't give him a chance," this group of seventh realm powerhouses spoke one after another, and this was the only way it worked. This stance of the little Marshall Saint was just too powerful. Not even an eighth realm Powerhouse could help him.

J Le, the leader of formation 019, couldn't help but exclaim in admiration when he saw that scene. Then, he looked at the enemy formation and shook his head even more breathlessly under Luu's threat. The sanctuary civilization's numbers were clearly superior, but at this moment, they were even using a defensive formation and playing the Turtle formation. No exaggeration, the little Marshall saint had changed the landscape of this war with his own power, but the ultimate winner would still have to depend on the duel between the two eighth realm combatants.

Jong Leu raised his head and looked towards the fierce battle above the sky. Whether the other side won or Sher Howen won, it would determine the direction of this battle. It wasn't right, Janely thought, looking at the opponent's defensive formation, and then saw that the playing style of the opposing eighth realm Powerhouse was also clearly biased towards defense. Instantly, she understood what was going on. The other side was waiting for backup. If they continued to drag on and waited until the supporting forces from the sanctuary civilization arrived and waited until the second eighth realm Powerhouse from the other side came over, then the outcome of them and of this war would be self-evident.

Jon Le wanted to say something, but he looked towards the Army Chief, Sher How, who kept on attacking fiercely, and instantly understood that the Army Chief was afraid that he had realized it a long time ago. He had to kill this eighth realm Powerhouse before the other party's support arrived. However, in the face of Sher Howen's Onslaught, the eighth Rome Powerhouse of the sanctuary civilization was not in a hurry. Even though he was at a disadvantage and in a disadvantageous position, a small smile appeared on the corner of Lewin's mouth as he said disdainfully, "Aren't you trying to kill me with just an attack like this? You want to kill me?" Luu looked up at the intense attack in the sky and gradually realized how bad the situation was. If the stalemate continued, it would be quite bad when the support team from the opposite side came over because of the instability of the secret entrance. The support speed of the sanctuary civilization was definitely slower.

A bit faster than the pace of the human race, doing nothing at this moment would amount to merely sitting on the sidelines. So, here's the question: What will it take to break the mold with this thought? Luu did not hesitate for even a second and made his choice immediately. The only way to break through is to confront the Monstrous might of the eighth realm Powerhouse that he had faced directly just now. It had given him a lot of insights. Under the urging of great pressure, it was the perfect opportunity for a breakthrough.

Luu closed his eyes and felt the boiling energy in his body, like a river. He felt the flesh that had been hammered to the extreme and felt the slowly rotating Marshall golden Dan. Then, there was a realization: break through to the sixth realm first and then try to master the rules. After accumulating for so long, it's time for me to step into the way of rules.

Chapter 221: Six Realms - A Leap in Life Levels

Previously, after breaking through the ninth level of the trial Mystic realm and completing the first stage, Luu had obtained a seventh stage Heaven and Earth Wonder fruit, the Yuan Ling fruit. After taking this Spirit fruit, Luu's cultivation skyrocketed in a short period of time, directly from the mid-stage of the fifth realm, stepping into the late stage of the fifth realm, and was just a step away from the peak of the fifth realm. The water polishing, which would have required careful polishing, was directly eliminated, and the effect was even more than that.

During these days of driving over in the spaceship, Luu had completely digested the residual energy of the yuanling fruit, and his realm had come to the peak of the fifth realm. Breaking through the sixth realm at this moment was actually not a difficult task. The difficulty lies in mastering the rules. Luu had actually come into contact with it a long time ago. The power of the sword Dow rules invoked by the natural ability sword da tonin, the Resonance of the ocean of rules caused by the opening of the Marshall way of ginan, sensing these rules, Luu gained a lot. However, trying to master these rules is nothing short of difficult.

The difference between the grandmas to the Marshall King realm was in the way of rules. This was also a difficult hurdle that stopped countless Celestial Pride. The way of rules was countless times more complex than inscriptions. To master the rules during the sixth realm period was truly one in a billion. In fact, at an earlier time, Luu understood the rules when he referred to the stone tablet of The Reincarnation Tower. At that time, Luu would be the inscription Dharma body Dharma phase, and domain. The relationship between these four is compared to point line surface space. Points make lines, lines make faces, and faces make space. The final space or domain is also the Prototype of rules. Today, it seems that there is some truth to this understanding, but not all of it. The way of rules, mysterious and wonderful, was not so simple.

Lui was well aware of how rugged and bumpy the road in front of him was, but he was not afraid. When he opened his eyes again, they were bright and determined. The moment Luu's internal Chi blood and Chi energy, like a Rushing River, constantly circulating, even if the momentum is fierce, it is still fixed within the meridians. At this moment, under his single thought, this rushing, unceasingly terrifying energy instantly broke through the Dyke Rumble inside Luu's body. All his Limbs and bones all over his body almost every place was being washed away by this raging torrent.

In the way of the martial artist, the foundation is the key. What's the foundation? Flesh and Blood, sinus, and Bones refining the organs, replacing the blood. How far back you can go depends on how strong the foundation in front of you is. For example, the key to Breaking the sixth realm lay in whether or not the foundation of the physical body was solid. An ordinary martial artist would usually need to take various potions and hire someone to protect their path before attempting to break through to the sixth realm. If one was a little careless, realm recession was a small matter, and there was even a certain possibility that one would die as a result. However, for Luu, the extremely risky sixth realm breakthrough was as simple as breathing because, in almost every realm, he had gone to the extreme to perfection. Even so, not only the previous four Realms but even the five Realms golden body had gone to the ninth turn.

At this moment, this terrifying torrent of energy was recklessly washing over Luu's physical body, but his expression did not change at all. As it continued to flush Luu's body, gradually, the qii blood and Chi energy that only flow in the meridians could now flow anywhere in the body unchecked. The feeling was like going from a Rushing River to an ocean. It's a qualitative change in energy. So it is no wonder those fifth realm Celestial Pride were unable to maintain their Dharma phases as well as their domains for long periods of time. However, the powerhouses of the sixth and seventh Realms are able to use the phases, the domains as they please. The difference in the energy is just too much. Instead of flowing through the meridians, using the body as a turning point, it can recklessly absorb the energy between Heaven and Earth in the void. It's not just a change in energy level; it's a leap in life level. No wonder I could only sense the rules during the fifth realm period, but it was.

I struggle to master these abilities; here's why:

My life level is not sufficient. You see, it's not a lack of talent. Rather, it's a matter of realms. Even someone as amazing and talented as his own father was unable to master the way of rules during the fifth realm period. It's impossible to master rules at this stage, even after a breakthrough to the sixth realm. The level of life completes its leap, and the so-called rules aren't as profound or difficult to grasp.

Luu, you've had a realization. No wonder you're amazing. But even someone as talented as you found it challenging to master the rules during the fifth realm period. It's not a lack of talent; it's a matter of realms.

The little Marshall Saint made a breakthrough at the brink of a breakthrough. You feel the change in Luu, and you freeze, slightly surprised. Breaking through to the sixth realm results in a leap in life level, a difficult hurdle to overcome. If one breaks through easily, one's life will be in danger. But Luu's breakthrough was smooth, with no surprises.

Jean Leu is not surprised. It's normal for a genius like the little Marshall Saint to be different. Without much thought, Jean Leu gets closer and transmits his voice into Luu's ears.

"Little Marshall Saint, we need your help."

Luu looks over, and Jean Leu immediately explains the situation. Although it appears that the Human Side has the upper hand, it cannot be dragged on. Once time passes, the supporting forces of the Sanctuary Civilization will inevitably come, one after another, and they will be in danger.

Today's plan must be to defeat and penetrate the enemy's large forces as soon as possible and defeat them completely. The Eth Rome Powerhouse, who is fighting against the Legion Chief's scorched heart, will be anxious and more likely to make a mistake. The Legion Chief's chances of winning will be even greater.

In the face of the current predicament, Luu thinks of his own way to break the situation. Of course, others will also think about how to break the situation. Jean Leu's plan is to overwhelm the opposite side's large troop as much as possible, causing the heart of that eighth realm Powerhouse to be in turmoil.

Luu doesn't refuse when he hears this. "Good. I will cooperate with you. With the help of the little Marshall Saint, we will definitely be able to bring down the large force on the other side."

Jean Leu says with a smile. "A little Marshall Saint of the fifth realm is strong enough. What about the sixth realm?"

Jean Leu can't help but look forward to it.

On the battlefield, facing the Sanctuary Civilization's Turtle formation, the Human Race's large force launches a general attack. Domains collide fiercely with domains, spreading attacks that instantly flood the army of the Sanctuary Civilization. Because of the unstable formation, there are heavy casualties, but it's just the deaths of some of the bottom tier soldiers. The seventh realm powerhouses don't care as long as they are fine.

At the core of the Turtle formation, dozens of seventh realm powerhouses use the teams under their command as meat Shields, allowing them to die against the front and block the rounds of attacks for themselves. For a moment, it really carries the onslaught of the human hordes. As long as their joint domain is not broken, it is impossible for this defensive Grand formation to be broken.

These Seven Realms foreign races are very confident. Even if the enemy's assassin is strong, there is ultimately a limit in the face of such a defense. Even if an eighth realm Powerhouse came, they would not be able to break it unless there are nine Realms in person. They just need to stall and they will win.

One side attacks fiercely, and the other doesn't move like a mountain for a moment. The situation is in a state of anxiety. Originally, according to Jean Liu's statement, the tribal team should attack fiercely and hit the opposite side of the Turtle formation to create a gap, and then Luu should take advantage of the opportunity to strike.

But now, the human army has been pounding away for half a day, and the gap still hasn't appeared. The domains collide fiercely, and there are violent energy explosions everywhere. Every single human martial artist, as if they were at home in death, goes forward and backward, charging forward with no desire to die.

Every minute and every second, countless foreigners die, and just as many human martial artists are sacrificed. However, what makes people helpless is that even with the many sacrifices and the continuous charging for a long time, they still can't make a gap.

Luu's eyes can't help but narrow slightly as he looks at the tragic scene in front of him. Among these people who have charged and killed, there are some that Luu is familiar with and has spoken to. But at this moment, they all died in the charge, never able to speak again, never able to go home again.

Watching so many human martial artists go forward and die, just to open a gap, is heartbreaking.

Amidst an opportunity for himself, Luu couldn't resist. Furrowing his brow, he stepped closer and said, "Let me try it directly." Jely responded without thinking, "The Gap hasn't been opened yet. You can't break through their formation; it's hard to maximize the effect of your attack. Wait a little longer."

Luu still wanted to fight for it, but Jeon Leu turned to look at him and said seriously, "Little Marshal Saint, please don't make their sacrifice meaningless. Be patient and wait for your chance. Make sure to strike a blow; it's the only way we can win."

Upon hearing this, Luu was momentarily speechless. The captain of Formation 011, Yang Zakai, also spoke up, "Little Marshal Saint, we understand you're in a hurry, but please don't rush. Give us a little more time."

The martial artists before and after Luu were opening the way with their lives, seemingly unaware of death. Under the continuous onslaught, the enemy hordes finally panicked and retreated. A gaping hole in their formation opened, and the captains urged Luu to seize the opportunity.

Luu had already prepared for this moment. His wings lifted violently, and he disappeared in place, rushing into the enemy camp through the gap. He killed his way to the core of the Turtle formation, facing dozens of Seventh Realm powerhouses. These powerhouses were shocked, scared, and delighted to see Luu charging at them.

The Seventh Realm powerhouses united their domains to suppress Luu, but a group of captains on the human side increased their domain collision to weaken the joint domains' suppression. These Seventh Realm powerhouses realized that they had to kill Luu first to ensure their safety.

Luu's body rapidly enhanced its attributes with the help of a golden Dan. He used his natural ability, Sword Da Tonin, to invoke the rules of the sword da and take the opportunity to master them. Despite the risks, Luu broke free from the joint domain's suppression and stunned the Seventh Realm foreign races with his unimaginable skill.

At the peak of the seventh realm, even seeing something couldn't help but cry out in shock. That's the power of rules. This assassin has even mastered the power of rules.
Chapter 223: Palm Rule Chopping the Eight Realms Above the Sky
The fierce battle was in full swing. Fighting to this moment, even if the golden General lay when how high-minded and proud, he had to admit that the person in front of him was really powerful to the extreme. Just a peak of the seventh realm could steadily suppress an eighth realm existence like himself.
However, even if they were more powerful, when the reinforcements came, the victory would no longer be in doubt. This is something that this guy across the street seems to be aware of. From just now until now, he's been pounding away, just fighting for time. Pity, even though he was losing ground, the strength of the eighth realm was placed here, and it was impossible to kill him in a short period of time.
Layan smiled faintly and said mockingly, "Unfortunately, you mostly realize that my reinforcements are coming over soon, and when I join forces with another eighth realm, you will have no more room to struggle."
Hearing this, Legion Chief Sher House's face was as gloomy as water. He seemed to have made some kind of decision and said with a sigh, "It seems that if I want to kill you in a short period of time, I can only exchange my life for a life."
When these words came out, the eighth realm Powerhouse, Layan, frowned slightly as he sneered and said, "Are you trying to scare me? Whether or not I'm bluffing, we'll know once we try."
Sher House said indifferently, "Raven was just about to say something when just then a sudden change occurred in the battlefield below. Luu rushed into the formation, the rules of the sword da entered his body, and his Aura seemed like the heavens were tilting. Kill! A furious shout that was deafening like a thunderous explosion echoed as a sword was swung out. Heaven and Earth cleared up as if the sky had opened up. Pull chopping God Boom! The terrifying energy completely exploded in an instant. The power of the stars of Heaven and Earth and the power of the rules of the sword da were all contained in this sword. It was like a river of stars hanging upside down with unrivaled terrifying might running rampant.
The Joint domain of dozens of seventh realm powerhouses would be difficult to break with a single move. Even if an eighth realm Powerhouse were to arrive in person, the power of this sword was even more terrifying to the extreme. However, at this moment, Luu was not bound by this joint field at all and directly crossed over the heavy field and chopped out in close proximity that would be fatal. No, the unspeakably terrifying energy as well as the terrifying rules of the sword da caused this group of seventh realm powerhouses to completely panic and each of them desperately resisted at all costs. Yet the sword was already close and any resistance seemed so futile.
When Jinshin Sword swept through, 237 realm foreigners were annihilated on the spot, while the other half of the seven realm powerhouses were injured with both light and heavy injuries. The serious ones died, while the lighter ones could still barely fight. But the problem was where could one regain the courage to fight after such a terrifying sweep of the sword. One by one, they turned their heads and ran.
As a matter of fact, at this moment, this sword not only destroyed the fighting spirit of these seventh realm powerhouses but likewise destroyed the military heart of the the sanctuary civilization's large force, and the formation that could still barely be maintained instantly collapsed. Run! Run! Escape! Nearly 10,0000 troops at the moment were fleeing in all directions.
In a Crows Nest, Jean Leu and the other captains looked at the scene in front of them and stared with shock and excitement. This sword of the little Marshall Saint had actually stepped into the rules mastering the power of rules. Right after breaking through to the sixth realm, what a horrible talent this is truly worthy of being the leader of the 10,000 Clan Heavenly Pride.
However, very quickly after seeing the opposite side scattering in all directions, Jean Leu and the others immediately reacted. They naturally would not let go of this good opportunity to beat up a falling dog. Kill! Jean Leu and the other captains immediately charged with the people under their command.
The moment Luu, who had managed to break the game with just one sword, didn't bother to take The Spoils of War or kill those Seven Realms who had been crippled by himself. As he directly lifted his wings and rushed up into the sky, Luu's goal had always been clear: to behead the opponent's eighth realm Powerhouse. This strike against those seventh realm powerhouses was merely a bullseye test to try and master the power of the rules of the sword da.
The unfamiliar sword da rules that ran rampant in the body brought great pain and damage but at the same time, it also brought an extremely terrifying increase in battle power for Luu. Luu even used this as a breakthrough point and managed to master one of the sword Da rules: chop at this moment with the aftermath of The sord Da Tong shun, the Marshall da golden Dan in his body was spinning crazily, and his might was no less than that of an eighth realm Powerhouse.
Legionnaire, "I'll help you."
Luu's eyes were icy cold as he stared dead at the eighth realm Powerhouse, Layan.

The look was akin to a hunter surveying his prey. Raven froze slightly, then erupted into a rage, shouting, "You deserve it!" Layin roared, his body once again erupting with terrifying might. However, this time, Luu showed not the slightest fear. "Eight Realms? It can also be chopped," he said, seeing the scene before him. Legion Commander Shera's eyes were filled with joy, and he couldn't help but smile, saying, "Good timing. What was initially feared didn't happen but went in the exact opposite direction. Sure, how, who had originally planned to fight for his life, didn't hesitate at this moment. The secret method of burning blood—open the blood-burning secret method to increase combat power for a short period at the cost of burning your life. The more life you burn, the more your combat power will increase. Sh planned to burn all of his life to forcefully kill the opposite eighth realm powerhouse, but with Luu's appearance, it was possible to not have to exchange lives, just burning some slightly. Boom! Once the blood-burning mysterious technique was opened, a blood-red aura instantly enveloped Sh's entire body. Without hesitation, he violently erupted, and the rule Lance in his hand directly stabbed out. On the other side, Luu similarly chopped out a sword, and the two attacks blasted out at the same time. Feeling the terrifying attacks from both sides, Lewin's face changed drastically. In this instant, the proud and arrogant man was finally afraid. He wanted to turn and run, but it was obviously too late. Rumble Dash! The two attacks collided, and the rule power on his body surface was gradually depleted. No! No! Raven's eyes widened in shock and anger. "He's the golden general of the Empire, a noble status, an ethereal realm demigod. How can you die in a remote place like this, unknown to anyone? How can you simply fall like that? No way, absolutely not!" Amidst the dazzling white light, the rule power that had been dissipated gradually annihilated his body, and his breath became weaker and weaker until it finally disappeared completely. An eighth realm foreign powerhouse died. With the fall of this eighth realm powerhouse, the power of the rules he had mastered also completely dissipated. At this instant, the heavens and earth shook, and visions appeared. One second, the sky was clear, the sun shining brightly; the next second, it was directly covered with dark clouds, the wind rising, the gale wailing, torrential rain pouring down, the sky seemingly crying deeply, lamenting the fall of this eighth realm powerhouse. The rain was automatically blocked by the chi on Luu's body surface, and only then did he exit the state of Sword Da Tonin. The endless pain immediately came like a tidal wave in the midst of the rainstorm. Legion Commander Sh looked at Luu, and the look in his eyes could be quite complicated. Chapter 224: The Wonderful Use of the Flame of Civilization. Long before he set off, when Hong, the chief commander of the secret realm, exhorted Sh, he mentioned in passing that if he encountered any troubles he couldn't solve, he could rely on the little Marshall St. Lou U. At the time, Sh was extraordinarily surprised. In his opinion, Luu was only at the fifth realm, and even if he was gifted with great talent, he was only at the seventh realm of battle power. How could he help himself out of trouble? In hindsight, it was his own shortsightedness. Who would have thought that after the little Marshall Saint broke through to the sixth realm, he would master the power of rules so quickly, then unite with himself to decapitate this eighth realm powerhouse? Although it looked as if the little Marshall Saint had paid a certain price and should have used some sort of secret method, how could he not, regardless of the methods used, beheading an eighth realm powerhouse being a solid battle record? This was an undeniable fact. A genius of this level, most likely the second exalted Marshall Saint, was thrown into the secret realm to try out what if something happened. This is the future hope of the human race. Ah, even if it needs to take risks, it should never be so radical. Thinking like this for a moment, Sh could be said to have mixed feelings. However, on second thought, chief commander Hong's reason for agreeing to Luu coming in and taking a risk was that he knew something. The Marshall Saint might have given Luu a bottom card or something, guaranteeing his safety to a certain extent. It makes sense when you think of it that way. Many thoughts and various thoughts flashed by. Sh immediately spoke, "Little Marshall Saint, this battle is thanks to you, but the crisis has not been lifted. The reinforcements from the opposite side will come over at any time." Listening to the words of the army chief, Luu nodded his head and was just about to open his mouth to speak when, at that moment, the Ray of civilization fire in his body, which had long been dormant, suddenly lit up as if it was resurrected from the dead. "What's going on here?" Luu looked at the glowing flame of civilization within his body and couldn't help but be a little surprised. Then he felt it clearly. Between Heaven and Earth, there was a hidden wisp of rule essence that was taken in. This was the origin of the rules that had returned to the heavens and earth after the fall of...

That eighth realm, Heavenly Pride, was also the source of the Heaven and Earth anomaly occurring at this moment. As this wisp of rule origin was taken over by the flame of civilization, the Heaven and Earth anomalies gradually disappeared. One second it was pouring rain, the next it was raining straight through, as if the vision of the party had never appeared. Luu felt the flame of civilization in his body, felt the strand of rule origin that had been taken over, and surprise was written all over his face. The flame of civilization had this kind of wonderful use.

This wisp of rule origin was the basic law origin, the origin of gold of the five elements. The rule that the eighth realm Powerhouse from the party mastered was the origin of gold. It was ingested by the flame of civilization. Luu whispered softly, "That means I can now directly sense the origin of his rules."

Seeing that the Heaven and Earth Visions had suddenly disappeared, Legion Commander Shha couldn't help but widen his eyes and look at Luu with some surprise. "What kind of tactic was this again?" he thought. "He actually couldn't even understand it anymore." However, it was a good thing that the Heaven and Earth Visions had disappeared, making this area seem less conspicuous. If the Heaven and Earth Visions were still there, this place would be like a flame in the darkness of the night, announcing to everyone that an eighth realm Powerhouse had died here.

This sudden disappearance of the vision was even more bizarre, inevitably causing fear in the hearts of the people. They couldn't understand the situation and dared not act rashly. Thinking of this, Shha immediately made a decision. He opened his communication device and commanded, "The battle lines are closing in. Everyone pull back immediately, and when you get back, clean up as much of the battlefield as you can. It was definitely no stroke of luck that the Sanctuary civilization was able to spot our large rear outpost and predict our support in advance. The opposite side should have mastered some kind of extremely special detection means in order to ambush us in advance. We need to understand this means of detection and then find the appropriate solution in order to allow subsequent support units to avoid being ambushed in advance. This is critical, and there is not much time left for us. All formations, please execute the mission immediately. I repeat, all major formations pull back and execute the mission immediately."

An eighth realm Powerhouse who was rushing alone looked up at the vision in the sky, his eyes filled with disbelief. The golden general of the Empire died just like that. He was an eighth realm Demag, also mastering the origin of gold. Whether it was his ability to fight or defend, he was incomparably powerful. Surprisingly, he died just like this. "Who the hell killed him?" This is a heinous crime, a defiance of the god king. Roger gritted his teeth.

"My Lord General, gold has already fallen. Do we still need to go over to support him?" the subordinate asked, a bit skeptical.

"Of course we have to go over there," Roger glared at his subordinate. "Killing the Empire's golden general is an absolutely unforgivable offense, and the opposite side definitely paid a terrible price for killing Raven and defeating his army. Whether it's the strong people on the other side or their army, they should all be in a state of exhaustion at this moment. This is the best opportunity. If I don't dare to go over there to take revenge, I'll definitely be laughed at by the other Demag Gods."

The subordinate wanted to speak but didn't continue. There was indeed some truth in Lord Roger's analysis. However, just then, the vision above the sky suddenly disappeared, as if it never existed. Seeing this scene, Roger, who was originally filled with anger, gave a thump in his heart, and a coolness gradually spread throughout his body. This eighth realm falling vision would exist for at least a day and a night. How is it that in just a short while it has disappeared? Roger opened his mouth, a look of dismay filling his face. "This is the rule essence being devoured. How is that possible? Even if even a true God came over, I'm afraid that he wouldn't be able to do it easily."

Not only him, but the subordinates on the side were even more jaw-dropped. "My Lord, do we have to support now?" the subordinate stammered, stunned. "This kind of terrifying existence is definitely not something we can mess with."

"The situation has changed," Roger said. "Our mission now is not to go over to support but to report this news."

"Yes," the subordinate hurriedly lowered his head and couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Lord Roger's head was ironic and chose to continue his support.



"You killed 237th realm foreigners, seriously injured 14 seventh realm foreigners, lightly injured 18 foreigners, and teamed up with Legion Commander Shha to kill an eighth realm Foreigner Powerhouse. Your timely intervention influenced the course of a skirmish and saved the lives of many martial artists. I am here to represent all the martial artists of all Races to express my high regards to you. You have earned 109,000 military points, gained a contribution value of 109,000,000 points, and received first-class military honor. Lieutenant Colonel Luu, your rank level has been raised from Lieutenant Colonel to Major."

At this moment, several lines of prompts appeared one after another on the military achievement recording device that Luu carried with him. Luu scanned the prompt and realized that the...

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

The major Luo-Lu recording equipment informed him that the loot he should have obtained was not found. The loot collection squad would bring him the loot that belonged to him and send it back to him. He was asked to wait patiently for a while. If he was in a hurry, he could contact the trophy-seeking collection squad in advance.

As Lu noticed, such a text prompt made sense. If not all the enemies had been decapitated, they would not have gone to collect loot instead of continuing to fight, causing the formation to be disrupted and leading to a chaotic battle. Moreover, the team would not be able to muster sufficient combat power. To avoid this, a fair mechanism for distributing loot was a must. Although it might seem tacky to talk about benefits, this world was not black and white, and martial artists needed a lot of resources to cultivate, making it an unavoidable topic.

Many martial artists were risking their lives to fight, charging forward and backward, and risking everything for the future of humanity and for personal practice and to leave a good inheritance for their future generations. It was unrealistic to expect them to do this without any reward just for the sake of ideals and righteousness. There were those who were passionate about their idealism, those who didn't need benefits, and those who were willing to give everything for the sake of humanity. However, there were also ordinary people with complex emotions, who did not think it was okay for warriors to go hungry and fight to death.

Therefore, whether it was about righteousness or profit, both needed to be achieved, and only in this way, the human community could be united as one. The trophy collection squad sent the trophies over to Lu. When he saw the loot piled in front of him, Lu was surprised by how much was there. Among the treasures were those of the seventh and eighth realms, as well as the treasures of the powerhouse of the seventh realm.

When Lu was in the midst of his enlightenment and cultivation, he opened his eyes and saw the loot in front of him. He looked at it and asked the person in charge, "What's going on?" "This is the loot that belongs to you," the person replied with a smile. Lu looked at the loot piled in front of him and saw that there were treasures of the seventh and eighth realms. He smiled and said, "I'll take this one-third of it, and the rest will be distributed among everyone, including the sacrificed martial artists."

The person in charge was taken aback and then nodded in agreement. "Everyone has obtained the loot they deserve, and there's no need to worry about this," he said. Lu shook his head and said, "If not for the bravery of the martial artists who fought forward and opened a gap in the enemy formation, I wouldn't have been able to kill so many seventh-realm powerhouses with a single sword."

The loot was distributed, and everyone cheered. No one had expected Lu to be so generous with his handiwork. The one-third of the loot he shared out was not a small amount. The seventh-realm loot was not particularly valuable, but the loot of the eighth-realm dignitary was different. The amount of treasure in the spatial rings was so great that it could be described as an explosion.

Lu obtained half of it and distributed a third of the half, and then spread the rest among everyone's heads. All of it was a large amount of wealth. A simple estimation put Lu's loot at trillions of star dollars, at the very least. In fact, at this level, it would be inappropriate to use star dollars as the common monetary unit of the human community, because there were things that could not be bought with just star dollars.

Inside the trophies that Lu had harvested, there was only one rare crystal, which was known as a Rule Crystal.

The ring of an eighth realm Powerhouse burst forth, releasing two of its Powerhouses for the people of Luu and Legion Commander Sh. How astonishing, equivalent to a trillion dollars in first-class hard currency, no one would want to trade rule crystals for ordinary star elements. Shha was more than willing to share the spoils, revealing no intention of deceiving Luu regarding the distribution of the loot. Upon examining the rule crystal, bloomed with brilliant colors, it was clear that the rule origin power contained within was incredibly pure and majestic. The eighth realm considered it a first-class treasure, a rarity even among ninth realm Marshall Kings in the human Community.

Eighth realm foreigners, especially those carrying two rule crystals of treasure, demonstrated an ominous home base. Although they dared to carry such powerful entities with them, which was no one's norm, this kind of person in the entire Mysterious Realm was considered a formidable foe, worthy of threatening one's life. The eighth realm of the Mysterious Realm was substantially richer than its human counterparts, boasting significant advantages. Crucially, though, the realm's strength remained vulnerable. Even an eighth realm Marshall King, not yet battle-hardened, posed little threat. In contrast, Luu and his party were formidable opponents.

As Luu gazed at the Golden Rule origin attached to the flame of civilization, a hint of a smile danced on his lips. This discovery was the most profound gain from killing an eighth realm Powerhouse. The party had only begun to grasp its powers and, with the aid of the Tiufraction Dharma pill and Tiuf immortal cells, Luu had gained a glimpse into the Mysteries of the rule origin of gold – a concept tied to purity and unstoppable forces. The rule's rule of the sword and gold converged in a striking display of power. Marshall Kings and their scouts were stunned, with all of them displaying numbness. Joe Hanu, leader of the scouting squad, held up a piece of what looked like a compass and approached Legion Commander Shah, reporting, "Our tests have confirmed it indeed is a sanctuary civilization, which can detect our arrival beforehand."

"What is its principle?" Shuhray sought to know. "Can we decipher it so far?" Legion Commander Shuhray asked with a smile. "We use the means of Faith as our detection method. All individuals without the God King as their faith will be sensed by this special machine. This is the means by which the sanctuary civilization search for and detect Infringers."

The Legion Commander's words left Shuhray perplexed. "Is there a way to counteract this?" he asked. Johan nodded, "Our technology isn't of high caliber, but we've parsed out two methods. First, forming a special barrier to block the means of detection and advancing silently. The second is to disguise yourself as a Believer and pretend to be their companion, surprising them with a sneak attack."

"Which method is the safer one?" Shuhray asked. Johan, "The former is safer, though the latter may be slightly riskier due to their encrypted communications and special code words we can't decipher just yet."

Shuhray turned to the communicator and asked, "Can we crack their communications and special code words?" Johan shook his head, "Without a massive amount of samples, our technology won't be able to decipher it, regardless of its power."

After some discussion, Sheral patted Johan's shoulder and said, "Don't be stingy, it's no issue for you." Johan laughed, "Marshall Saint gave us a generous portion; I was too stingy earlier."

As they parted ways, Shuhray's gaze fell upon Johan, a hint of pride on his face. "You deserve this. It's not every day a Marshal gives away personal treasure so freely."

Shuhray's reply came with a smile, "It's because of your honor and remarkable status. You can act so honorably without fear of reprisal." Shha nodded and then commanded his communicator, "The reorganization is complete. The ship has been repaired, and all are set to depart for the human Outpost using formation 007. We are to take the latest Intel and steer out of the Secret Area immediately. This mission is critical."

The Vanguard Squad has yet to establish contact with the Outpost, and I need to be informed of the situation there beforehand. Dispatch an undamaged ship to investigate the circumstances for me. The Scouting team has deciphered the sanctuary civilization's detection method, which will be applied to the rest of the airships. Luu is still working on understanding the principles of the Golden Rule, even after repairing the damaged parts of the ship, the kinetic energy is only 46% of the original speed, meaning it will take an hour to reach the Outpost. No contact has been made with the Outpost yet, and there's a strong possibility that the enemy is all but dead. However, it's still impossible to give up the last glimmer of hope, as a great battle is imminent. Despite everyone's apprehension, Lui is determined to seize this last opportunity and continues to train hard. Only cultivation can help him forget the pain of Sword da tonin, which penetrates deep into his soul.

In the war Fortress, in a large conference room, Chief Commander Hong listened to the latest news with furrowed brows. Could it be that the Holy Realm's god king is still alive? He should have fallen long ago or fallen into Eternal Slumber. A Supreme Being from several reincarnations ago could never have survived that long; this must be a tactic they left behind. The little Marshall Saint killed 237th realm foreigners with a single sword, seriously injured 147th realm foreigners, and lightly injured 18 foreigners. He also teamed up with another powerhouse to kill an eighth realm Foreigner.

Hunza opened his mouth with a surprised expression in the conference room, and several other Marshall Kings were stunned when they heard this news. Yone understood some inside information and couldn't help but ask if the Soul Seal had been triggered. Hong shook his head, the Soul Seal hasn't been triggered yet; it's the little Marshall Saint's own strength. Ha yupon was confused and asked if the little Marshall Saint was only at the fifth realm. The fifth realm was unable to grasp the power of rules, so even though it was powerful, there was an uncrossable chasm with the eighth realm. Even the Marshall St Lu Chang xang, who was invincible at the fifth realm back then, and speedily passed through the 10,000 Clans Heavens Pride battle was unable to threaten the eighth realm at the fifth realm. This is a fact that is not in doubt, but what about the Intelligence coming back from the secret realm now?

H nodded with an odd expression on his face and continued. He is no longer in the fifth realm and has broken through to the sixth realm during the battle. Hearing this, Yom, and the other few Marshall Kings did not know how to spit for a moment. Could it be that when he breaks through to the sixth realm, he'll be able to master the rules right away? Eon couldn't help but open his mouth and ask a question that was also on the minds of several other martial Kings. Hong nodded and looked up at the crowd. Battle Intelligence indeed, the little Marshall Saint broke through to the sixth realm on the verge of a battle and quickly grasped the rules.

The people in the room were silenced by the news. The way of rules was mysterious and wonderful, how profound and unfathomable. After cultivating for their entire lives, they had only managed to comprehend the way of rules and had barely entered the Marshall King realm as a result. Now, the little Marshall Saint had just broken through the sixth realm and had mastered a rule. What kind of cosmic joke is that? Although they had known for a long time that Lui was gifted and the leader of the 10,000 Clan's Heavenly Pride, which one of them was not a genius among Geniuses? Whoever can achieve the Marshall King realm is there anyone easy to deal with? Yet Lui's natural Talent would have such a huge gap in comparison. Many martial arts Kings were numb at this moment.

Soon, this news reached the YEARS of Marshall St L Chang Shing chapter 227, Fusing the Rules, a Critical Breakthrough, Instantaneous Six Realms. This was not a surprise to Lu Chang xang, who had been the same in the beginning. A sixth realm breakthrough that could be a life and death barrier for ordinary people for the top Geniuses, but nothing at all. However, having just broken through the sixth realm and mastering the power of rules in a watery manner, even Lu Changqing was a bit surprised. This was really too much, even more outrageous than himself back then.

After a moment of serious thought, Lu Chang Shing thought of the reason. It must be because of the Descent of the Ocean of Rules. Yes, that's how it should be. Nothing can be accomplished overnight, not even the most genius can create something out of nothing if it's because of the Ocean of Rules, it makes a lot more sense. Previously, he could only barely comprehend it, unable to truly Master it, and it was only after breaking through to the six realm that his life level was elevated, that he fully grasped the power of the rules. That's just as surprising, but at least it's understandable now. So it seems I underestimated him, Lu Chang Shing shook his head, his eyes filled with anticipation.

I initially thought I could swiftly consume the E Soul seal, concluding the adventure, but I did not anticipate such an unexpected turn of events. Perhaps you can depend on the unique ICS of the Flame of Civilization to roll up a snowball within the secret realm, comprehending, fusing, and perfecting his own set of rules. This is undoubtedly a chance for rapid growth, but the extent of his progress within the secret realm is entirely up to him. The most powerful individual is only in the ninth realm, or an extremely rare and elusive existence that generally does not intervene at all. Of course, even if such a being were to emerge, Luu has the soul seal to handle any trouble.

As for the Supreme Being in the secret realm, it has long been in a state of Eternal Slumber. Even if civilization were to be destroyed, it may not awaken. Even if it does awaken, it would merely be a withered remnant of a body. The ancient relics from countless reincarnations ago have long lost their true essence, chasing after eternity. Its strength is not even a threat to the great existences among foreign races. In Li Ching's opinion, this mysterious realm is the ideal battlefield for trials, menacing yet rewarding. The growth potential is even more terrifying, as it is the only place where one can make significant progress in a short period.

While Luu was breaking through the sixth realm and the secret realm, killing an eighth realm powerhouse, causing a group of Marshall Kings to be shocked and numb, Luu himself was diligently practicing cultivation. It was challenging to participate in the rule of gold, and even more difficult to fuse the rule of gold with the sword da rule chop. Even with the true diffractive Dharma pill and the true immortal cells, comprehending them was extraordinarily slow. It was simply impossible to make a sudden big jump in a short period.

Luu pondered for a long time and took out the UR rule Crystal from the Chuan treasure Pearl. A single rule Crystal was worth a trillion star dollars, equivalent to an extremely valuable treasure or even a secondary Supreme treasure. It is usually used to barter for needed treasures, weapons, and great medicines. Very few people practice with it, not to mention Marshall Kings. Even ordinary Marshall Emperors did not have such luxury. But now, Luu was planning to consume it as a means to enhance his cultivation. Since he wanted to continue in the secret realm, he had to make some trade-offs, sacrificing a handful of luxuries.

Luu gritted his teeth and began to absorb the extremely pure and majestic rule origin power inside this rule Crystal. As this terrifying force of rule origin entered his body, his physical quality began to slowly improve. His blood, flesh, sinus, bones, and the five viscera rapidly strengthened, taking a step forward from the original Foundation 100t pole. Luu was a bit surprised after reading the various pills rewarded by the system, coupled with the way of Flesh becoming sainthood. His physical foundation had already gone to the extreme, and he did not expect that it could actually continue to be enhanced. Sure, enhancements are modest, it's just a side effect after all. Most importantly, it was still used to realize the way of rules.

With the entry of these rule origin forces into his body, the original obscure and difficult to grasp and even more difficult to integrate Golden Rule origin suddenly became much more adorable. The speed of comprehension was completely incomparable compared to earlier. In just a moment, Luu managed to grasp a rule characteristic, sharpness, from this rule origin of gold. Golds sharp sort of chop complemented each other, and if they could be successfully fused, Luu's killing methods would definitely be taken to the next level.

With a flash of this thought, the massive amount of rule origin power began to be frantically consumed. When the rule origin power contained in the rule Crystal was completely consumed, the two rule characteristics of sharpness and chopping finally completed their initial Fusion, finally successfully fused. Unfortunately, it's only a preliminary Fusion. Luu slowly opened his eyes, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes, looking at the rule Crystal that was consumed and only left an empty shell. He couldn't help but lament a treasure worth a trillion dollars and this is used up. However, the progress is terrifying, and that's enough.

Referring to the way of rules, Luu no longer had the means to make sudden progress through the true immortal cells and tisue defra of Dharma pill as usual and needed to use the even more precious rule crystals. Obviously, as one's strength progressed, there was no way that the top treasures that one got at the very beginning would be able to make an immediate impact. This was normal. The way of rules belonging to the eighth realm, the ninth realm's ability, the true Immortal cell, and true defract Dharma pill were also ninth-ranked treasures. Unless a 10th order treasure is obtained, the descending blow can continue, and with the prolonged consumption, the medicinal power of the tyu diffractive law pill was already going to consume a large portion of it. After the power was completely consumed, it was feared that the progress would be even slower. Luu shook his head and looked again at the Golden Rule origin of the civilization Flame with sharpness being penetrated and mastered. This wisp of Golden Rule origin dissipated by half, obviously, there was another characteristic that Luu had not mastered. Luu had probably understood this characteristic when he had participated in the previous adventure.

Enlightenment is a challenging endeavor. Once this trait is penetrated, it will lead to an extremely powerful defense. But now, there is no time, and there are no rules. Luu must achieve Enlightenment at this very moment.

Luu's voice came from Legion Commander Sher's house. "Everyone, listen up. The ship is about to arrive at The Outpost, where the war is currently ongoing. Our outposts, according to the striker's visual inspection, have suffered heavy casualties. Not one in ten, but they are still holding out, waiting for our support. Our mission this time is to repel the forces of the Sanctuary Civilization and relocate everyone at The Outpost." (Chapter 228: The Mountainous Human Outpost)

Legion Commander Sher paused and continued, "This battle will be very treacherous, but it's not without a chance. The army currently besieging The Outpost does not know that we've broken through the blockade. This is our only chance, gentlemen. Success or failure depends on this."

Everyone's heart sank as they listened to the Legionnaire's words. An hour's wait, and the big battle would finally be here. Even though Luu had prepared himself mentally, he was still inexplicably nervous to hear the news. At this moment, the battlefield of The Outpost was extremely tragic, with only one out of ten remaining. This support mission was equally perilous.

When Luu heard this, he immediately felt the oncoming pressure. But what flowed from his eyes was still a look of eagerness to try. He had already fused the chop of the sword da rule in the sharpness of the rule of gold. At this moment, his offensive ability was much stronger than before. This was a big battle, just enough to verify one or two things. If it was possible, he would behead another eighth realm Powerhouse, let the fires of civilization suck out its rules of origin.

Sure, it had gotten a lot stronger, but Luu didn't look down on those eighth realm powerhouses. Similarly, there was a difference between a high and a low level of power in the eighth realm. An eighth realm that mastered the characteristics of a rule was only considered an eighth realm initiation. The strength of the eighth realm that mastered the characteristics of two rules was likewise not very strong, just a little stronger than the entry level.

The golden General that he had encountered before was this type of eighth realm. An eighth realm that mastered five or six rule characteristics would be extremely strong and would be considered a stalwart combatant of the eighth realm. As for those eight or nine or even a dozen rule characteristics of the eighth realm, that was very terrifying and was considered the top eighth realm Battle Force.

There was also that eighth realm limit, mastering the five elements of earth, fire, wind, and water or gold, wood, water, fire, and Earth, fusing the characteristics of all the basic rules with each other, allowing the composition of the world within to gradually stabilize. Its strength was completely no less than that of an ordinary ninth realm Marshall Emperor. This was also considered the eighth realm.

Currently, Luu could only bully some introductory eighth realm or an eighth realm like the golden General. If he met a middle or high-level warrior, it would be very difficult to fight, even with an advantage above the attack by virtue of the fusion rule of chop and sharpness. It was simply impossible to behead them. If he encountered those top eighth realm Warriors, Luu was afraid that he wouldn't even have the power to fight and even escaping would be a problem.

As for the eighth realm limit, Luu was afraid that he could be ravaged in a single glance, not on the same level. Sure, he had the soul seal, but it was a matter of life and death. The soul seal would then trigger automatically at that time. Whether it was the e realm limit or the ninth realm, all of them would be out of luck. But once the soul seal was triggered, this adventure would end here, and within three years, don't think about venturing out.

Until the critical moment, until the time of true desperation, the soul seal was definitely something that could be used, not used. Just as Luu was thinking this, Legionnaire Sher approached him. "In this battle, I still have to ask you, little Marshall Saint," Sher said with a heavy face.

According to the Vanguard squads' probing, there were at least two eighth realm powerhouses in the Sanctuary Civilization's encircling army, and that was still a conservative estimate. One of the eighth realm powerhouses required a little Marshall Saint to deal with it. If not, even a sneak attack would have made it difficult for them to complete the rescue.

Listening to Sher's words, Luu nodded and said seriously, "Leave it to me." Sher couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief when he heard this. Immediately, he took out a rough map of the battlefield of The Outpost and narrated the specific details of the battle with Luu.

It had to be said that Sher House's rescue plan, though rough and simple, had basically taken into account all the places that could be considered. Even Luu's division from the grand SE Chief Marshall made it difficult to find any loopholes in it. This plan was perfect, simple, and easy to understand.

Luu couldn't help but say, "Legion Commander, your command ability is very good." He had already deduced this plan countless times. Sher laughed, very self-satisfied. He heard that Luu's teacher was Sword Emperor Xiao, so he wanted to ask for his opinion. Since Luu said so, he was relieved, 50 km from the battlefield.

In the outpost, the fleet of airships halted, and the crowd prepared to rush to the battlefield. In the support team, the lowest realm was the fifth realm existence, and the 50 km distance in the district could be easily covered in a few minutes at full speed. This proximity made it easy to be alerted if they got any closer. Once the other party became aware, the stealth attack plan would fail. Human outposts were filled with broken walls, corpses, and rivers of blood, as the war hadn't stopped since it began.

The large Sanctuary Civilization army, numbering between 500,000 and 600,000, was overwhelmingly considered canon fodder for an eighth-realm demigod. The lives of soldiers at the bottom were equivalent to expendable items, sent to die as a way to sap the fighting spirit and physical strength of human warriors. Underestimating this and viewing every wave as canon fodder would put one at a significant disadvantage.

The Sanctuary Army's routine involved a cold, sudden attack with a thunderous strike, killing dozens or even hundreds of human martial artists. They immediately withdrew before the human martial artists could counterattack, much like a pack of wolves hunting. The strategy was to constantly attrite the enemy, keeping a close eye on their prey to prevent escape. This approach minimized casualties in the war effort.

On the human side, all martial artists pinned their hopes on reinforcements, but they had not arrived after a long wait. Perhaps the message didn't reach the commander, or the messenger was taken out halfway through. The human commander outside might have given up on them, considering the high cost of rescue and the potential to establish a new outpost.

At the outpost, Chow Shia, a peak seventh-realm martial artist and the army chief with eighth-realm strength, was covered in wounds. The Sanctuary Civilization's army attacked again, without giving them a moment's respite. An emissary from the Sanctuary Army called out to those who surrendered, promising they would not be killed. This was the last chance to surrender, and kneeling at the feet of the god king would forgive all sins.

The reason for the emissary using the human language was simple. Someone from the clan's martial arts had surrendered in utter despair, facing imminent death. Not all could face death openly, as there's great terror between life and death. Even if mentally prepared to die, fear would still arise in the moment of death, leading to retreat, escape, or surrender. It wasn't surprising for a few such people to emerge among so many human martial artists.

People are complicated, and the outpost had a mix of heroes and those who would humiliate themselves to survive. For them, even kneeling at the feet of the secret god meant living, even if it meant betraying their own race. Regret might follow, but the choice had been made. The Sanctuary Civilization used foreigners to persuade surrender, as they knew these traitors might face shame or fear the human race's martial artists would behead them.

At the outpost, the emissary's words led to silence, and even Legion Commander Chow Sha didn't speak. The messenger was delighted, sensing an opportunity. He urged the human martial artists to surrender, promising they wouldn't be brutalized further. The Supreme Demigod Lord admired their courage and offered power, status, beauty, and cultivation resources if they joined them. This was the respect they deserved, and they were given a final 5 minutes to decide. Continued resistance would no longer be counseled, and they would no longer extend the invitation to surrender.

Please improve the English in this text while maintaining the original meaning only. Do not add any other text or shorten the story:
For that matter, you will die even though it would be a shame to kill you, Warriors. This is the last exhortation. I hope you'll talk it over with the foreign Emissary who came to persuade him to surrender. He had a pretty good memory, and although these words were spoken in an awkward and twisted manner, all the martial artists in the Outpost heard and understood them.
Facing death or surrender to the foreigners, this is the question before all Legion Commander Chaa looked up at the gloomy sky and didn't know what he was thinking. Yen Jingu, the deputy regimental commander on the side, suddenly said, "Legion Commander, perhaps we can pretend to surrender. These foreigners survive first and wait until the critical moment. Then, we'll rebel, and in that case, it won't be considered betrayal of the human race. Save the Green Hills. Don't worry about the wood."
Hearing this, Chiaa looked deeply at Yen Jingu. "Do you think that the sanctuary civilization would be so stupid?" Chia Sha asked indifferently. At these words, Yen Jingu fell silent. "Yeah, would a sanctuary civilization be so stupid? Absolutely not. Saying such things now is just lying to yourself. Once you surrender, it's a road of no return. If you want to live, I won't stop you."
Hearing this, Yen Jingu raised his head in consternation, and there was some trembling in his voice. "What about that legionnaire you, me, Chia Sha?"
Chia Sha couldn't help but laugh when he heard this and his laughter seemed extraordinarily relaxed, as if he was finally going to be relieved of this ordeal. "A death is just a death. What is there to fear? I've lived 178 years, and I've lived long enough. There's no way I'm surrendering. Just die in this secret realm. Dying in battle—that's the destiny of a martial artist. The only shame is that I won't be able to go back and see my great-great-grandchild. Children again."
Hearing this, Yen Jingu's eyes widened as he said, word for word, "You're willing to be a martyr, Legion Commander? But you're trying to fool us into being cowards, are you? Insulting me? Since you chose so, there is no turning back."
Xia Sha looked at him. "It's just a death. What's there to fear?" Yen Jingu also laughed. "Take this question and ask everyone about it."
Xia Sha shook his head. Soon, everyone at The Outpost faced this problem: a heroic death or live in humiliation. In the face of this one question, the 508 martial artists still alive in the Outpost, without exception, all gave the same answer. One death is all it takes. One death only, there are so many things to regret, so many things to try to make up for, and simply not too many reasons to live. Who doesn't want to live? But they carry so much on their backs. Too many martial artists have died here, whatever for them or for yourself. All must never surrender. One death only.
As it is, then go to your death. After hearing everyone's replies, Xia Sha smiled once again, this time with a smile full of relief. He raised his head and looked at the distant Army that looked like a sea of mountains. His eyes filled with contempt. He opened his mouth with a wide grin. "A mere foreign race from the Taiway mysterious realm, a race from a few reincarnations ago, lingering and surviving until now. Not even a lowly civilized group is worthy of making us human martial artists surrender. Haha! What a laugh! Even if we go to our deaths, we can't die like this. Since the support troops won't be coming, let's launch a final charge. Pass the order to make the final charge. We're going to die in the final charge."
The demigod Watson stared at the distant battlefield and couldn't help but sigh when he saw that this team on the opposite side didn't have the intention of surrendering but instead gathered their ranks and appeared to be about to launch a charge. What a strong army! What a shame! An army composed entirely of warriors. The army of the god king is nothing more than that. The human race behind them is still really not simple. However, since you chose to go to your deaths, you will all be killed. Pass the order down. Final Siege. Kill all human martial artists.
When the order was passed down, a few human traitors couldn't help but tremble when they heard it. At the end of the day, they still chose to go to their deaths as the armies of sanctuary continued to gather. The final battle began. The 5508 people of the human Outpost. If nothing happens, all will die here. Here, however, just then, a sudden change occurred.
Chapter 230: How Dare You Stop Me at the Sixth Realm!
Xia Sha roared and slashed out. A peak seventh realm Foreigner was directly split in half. Even if they were at the peak of the seventh realm, there was a difference between high and low in the case of utilizing the blood-burning mysterious technique. Not to mention a foreigner who was also at the peak of the seventh realm, even if it was a foreigner of the eighth realm, he would be able to decimate it. Nay, the opposite side avoids fighting. Demigod Watson naturally knew how powerful Chia Sha was. However, he couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. Even if they were to die, they should have died with dignity. But now, they were just being slaughtered like animals. This was not the way a martial artist should die.

Sha was hesitant and dared not approach at all. He dragged the situation out until the secret method on the opposite side ended, knowing that he could easily be killed even if it meant the deaths of several Divine Ambassadors from the Seventh Realm. Although Sha was in the Seventh Realm, his combat power was no less than the average Eighth Realm. Demigod Watson had already regarded him as an equal opponent. To kill a demigod, even at some cost, was understandable to the True God Lord. In an instant, Sha had already carved a bloody path. However, with too many foreigners around, it was impossible to kill them all. As the blood-burning mysterious technique continued, Sha's gray hair gradually turned silver white. It was as if a burning log was about to burn out. When he had just established the human outpost, Sha still had a full head of black hair, but now not a single black hair remained. With his life about to burn out, he raised his head to look at Demigod Watson in the distance and opened his mouth to ask, "Demigod Watson, are you daring to fight me again?"

Watson snorted and laughed, "Do you think I'll give you that chance? Your short-term combat power, utilizing this secret method to burn life force, is far above mine. How stupid am I to fight you? Ridiculous, ridiculous. Your life is about to burn out. You're nothing more than a person who is about to die. Why should I fight with you? Explode your last rage. Since you're unwilling to kneel at the feet of the God King, go to hell. No one can save you."

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! A team of extremely elite soldiers suddenly raided the sanctuary's army, like a sharp knife that burned red and stabbed into congealed lard, instantly tearing open a huge gash. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Countless explosions covered the sky, and the Holy Realm Army's formations were blown to pieces in an instant. Blood flowed as the sharp knife continued to penetrate deeper and deeper. The formation of the sanctuary army gradually collapsed, and the casualty figures grew higher and higher. In the Holy Realm Army, the Divine Envoy in charge of scouting whitened his eyes, his complexion filled with astonishment. Just a moment ago, on Divine Luo, it had shown a team approaching, but since they were devotees, he didn't take it seriously and even sent a messenger to greet them, asking about their purpose. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, the opposite side attacked directly, making it too sudden. Shin actually made a mistake. What the hell is going on here?

Meanwhile, as Demigod Watson finished his harsh words, he heard a series of explosions from the rear, and the formation was slightly dispersed. He couldn't help but be a bit confused. What is this situation? Sha looked up to see this scene and couldn't hold back his tears. The support he had been waiting for so long is finally here. Stick around until the end of the day and wait. Brothers, reinforcements are coming! reinforcements are coming! Sha raised the long sword in his hand and shouted, "We have not been abandoned. The team to support us is here. Follow me to kill our way out!"

Sha charged up again, and with a single slash, he easily killed a Seventh Realm foreigner. Wherever he passed, he was invincible to 10,000 people. When Vice Yening saw this scene, his eyes turned red, and he immediately shouted, "Legion Chief, you can't use the secret technique anymore. If you don't stop, you'll die here. Since the reinforcements are already here, your blood-burning secret technique can stop. We'll just wait for help."

When Sha heard this, he was relieved and smiled. "As I said, the destiny of a martial artist is to die in the middle of the Sands. Even if I go back, I'll just be a wasil with no more years to live. In that case, might as well kill a few more Fay. Killing one is enough, killing too many is also revenge for the brothers. Moreover, for this final battle, I must kill an Eighth Realm demigod."

Saying so, Sha directly carved a bloody path to that demigod Watson's body, cutting him down. Watson was completely unprepared. Clearly, the reinforcements had come, and this human powerhouse was still looking for his own fight. You don't want to live, you're nothing but a Candle in the Wind. You deserve to be killed. What son was annoyed. He also has a bloody nature, which made him avoid fighting all the time. He had avoided fighting, but now, or by Sha's hand, he could also fight. These words were uttered while using the power of rules, and even though the language was not understood, both Watson and Sha could understand each other. Haha, not worthy of killing you. Hearing this, Sha said contemptuously, "You're nothing more than my underling. Without the rescue of another Eighth Realm, you would have died under my blade long ago. Now that my reinforcements are here, will there be a second Eighth Realm to save you?"

He did not stop the attacks on his hands with a slash. Under the ferocious and incomparable attack, Watson's Earth rule protection cracked in layers. Watson spat out a mouthful of blood and gritted his teeth. "If you don't use your secret technique, you won't be able to defeat me at all, you stupid Xia Sha!"

Xia Sha did not bother to talk any more nonsense. Or rather, he was no longer able to distract himself from talking. At this moment, he was about to reach the end of his life and was about to burn out at any time. If he were to be distracted again, he would more than likely miss a good opportunity.

Meanwhile, two other eighth realm Powerhouse auras erupted from the Sanctuary Domain Army. Sensing these two, Xia Sha's face changed, revealing a look of disbelief. "How is it possible? How come there were actually three eighth realms in this Holy Realm Army? Clearly, before there were only two. If there were only two, I'd take care of one, and the legionnaire of the support team would take care of another, and that would save the rest. But now there's actually a third eighth realm in the Holy Realm Army. What should we do?"

"Hahaha, Demag good!" Watson burst out laughing. "Don't you know what it means to be prepared? If you think we only have two eighth realms, you're sadly mistaken."

Xia Sha couldn't help but bite his teeth. "The reinforcements are clearly coming or not. It doesn't matter if I die here, but the 500 brothers who have fought so far must at least leave alive."

Above, a sixth realm and an eighth realm, Demag good, stared at the opponent in front of him, his face filled with a look of dismay. "Air sixth realm, and you dare to block me?"

Chapter 231: Sword Beheading Demigod Luu's Strength

Luu looked at the eighth realm Powerhouse in front of him with a calm expression. He could sense that the strength of this eighth realm on the opposite side was not too strong; it shouldn't be too far off from the strength of the Golden General that he had beheaded earlier. "Are all the eighth realms of your Sanctuary civilization at your level?" Luu was a bit curious and couldn't help but ask. That seemed a little hurtful, but this guy across the street was going to die anyway, and it didn't matter if it hurt or not.

Hearing this, Demag good froze slightly, his eyes filled with surprise. He had not expected at all that this little guy who was only a sixth realm would dare to say such words to himself. "What do you mean? Are the eighth realms of the Sanctuary civilization all at my level? Are you looking down on me? Or are you looking down on Sanctuary civilization?"

"Not true," Demag responded suddenly. "Why was he able to understand the words of this little guy across the room? Obviously, the language doesn't work, but what was said across the room, Demag could understand. What this means was naturally self-evident. Six realms, just six realms, mastered the rules. At this moment, Demag was shaken. In the Sacred Realm civilization, even geniuses who were expected to reach the True God Realm didn't have a tenth of the talent of this guy in front of them.

"A genius of your level," Demag stared at Luu, speaking in a voice that was filled with confusion. "Your civilization, it actually dares to let you come out and take risks? Isn't it afraid that you'll die?"

Luu couldn't help but laugh when he heard this. "You want to kill me? It is I who will kill you!"

A genius of this level, whether killed or imprisoned, was a great merit. Damon instantly disappeared in place and violently erupted with extremely terrifying energy. His body's aura was like the sea capsizing, directly killing over the rule origin that Damon had mastered was water. The rule characteristics he had mastered were change and healing. Among them, change is a means of attack, and heal serves as a means of defense and can also be used as a secondary means. At this moment, his means of attack was change. Water is the softest and the strongest with two completely opposing sides, and this is the mystery of change. At this moment, going all out to kill with the characteristic change operating to the extreme, the lethality at this moment even Luu had to treat with caution.

Luu did not hesitate and directly swung his sword. Paul returned to the ruins. Previously, it was difficult for this sword to threaten an eighth realm Powerhouse, but since Luu had mastered chop and sharpness, it was a completely different story. What's more, he had completely fused the two characteristics, and even if it was only a preliminary fusion that wasn't considered perfect, it still displayed an extremely terrifying power.

Boom! The attacks from both sides slammed together, and under the violent energy fluctuations, the Earth shook and trembled. Some cannon fodder soldiers in the Sanctuary civilization's Army, feeling the terrifying fluctuations that seemed to be able to destroy the world, were so scared that they directly fell to their knees. Similarly discolored were the other two eighth realm demigods, Watson and Yabu, and the other two eighth realm demigods looked at the terrifying fluctuations over here with some surprise. "All that commotion right off the bat to actually put up such a fight. That's not right. Damon's opponent, why isn't he more than a sixth realm? What level of terrifying genius is this?"

When Xia Sha saw this scene, he couldn't help but whiten his eyes. "What did he see? The one who was battling against the Sacred Realm civilization's eighth realm was actually Junior Marshall St. Luu. He's the son of a Marshall Sage, and he's coming over for support on..."

Here is the improved text:

Such a dangerous mission, at this moment he was still fighting with an eighth realm in a full-scale battle - this scene was simply ridiculous. Even Harden Chow Sha was slightly taken aback. There were rapid sword swings, chops, chops, chops, chops - the blade of the sword was incredibly sharp, as if it could cut through even the toughest and most changeable things, like water. Ordinarily, the characteristics of water would rule that Damon had mastered, somewhat restrain Luu's sword. However, at this moment, this sword surprisingly cut right through the water, the Destructive Sword Light. The aftermath of the destruction was so severe that Luu's momentum was unabated, and it directly smashed into Damon. Unable to help himself, Damon spat out a mouthful of blood, and although the surface was intact, his internal organs had been thoroughly stirred up. In the realm of eighth realms, a being such as Damon should have been severely weakened in a direct confrontation, but fortunately, he had the ability to recover. Damon immediately used his heel to recover his injuries, and as before, his health was restored. However, his face was still very unpleasant, and he stared at Luu in astonishment, as if it was impossible. How could this be? He was a demigod of the eighth realm, and under a head-to-head encounter, he had been completely crushed by a sixth realm - this was simply incredible.

Luu nodded slightly when he saw this scene. He hadn't gone all out right away, but his sharpness was still enough to crush his opponent, inflicting some injuries. The fusion of chop and sharpness was indeed effective. As soon as Damon saw that the opposite side had healed their injuries, he became surprised. "You still have the ability to heal? Is that part of your rule characteristics?"

Damon blushed hard and didn't answer, but he tacitly agreed. Luu smiled and nodded. Damon's face became a little strange at that comment. "What do you mean? It's nice? What's the meaning of this? Why would you praise my rule characteristics just now?"

Before he could react, Luu raised his long sword again. "Your rule characteristics are great but one of them is mine." Without hesitation, Luu used a powerful technique to swing the sword. Damon's hair stood on end in goosebumps, and his instincts whispered to him, "Danger, danger, danger, run away..."

Damon was confused, hesitating for a split second. This momentary hesitation was obviously too late to escape, and Luu's body had already reached its utmost state of strength, with the Marshall Golden Pill running wildly inside him. "Come and try this sort of mine. Come and resist it with all your might."

Luu lowered his head and looked at Damon with contempt from above. Damon finally responded without turning back, fleeing hastily. As he fled, he also shouted, "Watson, Yabu, help me!" He had no choice but to rely on the other two demigod powerhouses to have a chance of survival.

Needless to say, Damon's decision was not wrong, but unfortunately, neither Watson nor Yabu had the time to save him. "Ha! Don't think about rescuing Xia Sha," hahaha, laughed a power who stopped Watson who wanted to leave on the other side, saying, "Sh House swung out his rule Lance and stopped Yabu, and he couldn't help but feel in his heart how did it feel like the little Marshall Saint had gotten stronger again. It's really outrageous to escape above the sky!

Luu looked at this eighth Realm powerhouse's choice and said softly, "Stupid Choice." There was no hesitation, and the sword was swung directly. "Chop!"

Chapter 2329 of The Realms - how can you call yourself a god? Damon, who was originally trying to flee, was like lost, panicked, and ran towards the Sanctuary Army, as if he wanted to use these soldiers to help him block the sword. However, even so, it was still unable to stop the sharpness of the sword. "Boom! With just one sword, a bottomless gully appeared on the ground, and countless holy realm soldiers perished as a result. It was just a sword, and Damon couldn't resist it, even if he tried his best.

Damon kept urging the two rule characteristics of change and heal in an attempt to escape, in several battles in the past, as long as these two rule characteristics were pushed to the extreme, one could survive even the most dangerous situations. This time, this time, there will be no exceptions, and Damon's mind growled. In fact, if Luu had only mastered chop and sharpness, he wouldn't have been able to kill the Demigod of the eight realms, even if he had gone all out with his chopping God one sword, the restraint of the rule characteristics was one aspect, and the other was his ability to preserve his life, which was simply too strong. Change can be used to attack and likewise to save your life. Healing was not to mention, just in an instant, even if the injury was heavy, it could be quickly recovered as before. It really wasn't normal for Luu to want to decapitate him, but now, when chop and sharpness were fused, 1 plus one was greater than two, and it had been sublimated to a whole new level. Even the rule of the most soft and rigid water was all chopped up for you.

"Boom! To the extreme!"

Energy suddenly fusing the power of the rules exploded in this instant. Damon, whose original intention was good, finally despaired at this moment. The sword, that sword! His eyes whited with horror, his eyes filled with remorse. Why did he back down? He was the high priest of the Empire and a Demag good of the highest nobility. It was inexplicable. Why did he fall here? This is just ridiculous. Damon died an eighth realm De Mag God had fallen just like that. Rumble. Rumble. Lightning flashed and thunder roared. Dark clouds covered the sky, and torrential rain fell. And the Heaven and Earth suddenly appeared. But in the next second, the Heaven and Earth Vision suddenly disappeared.

A new strand of rural origin appeared in Luu's flame of civilization. It was this Damon's water rule at this moment. Everyone was stunned by this sudden change. But in the instant before they could react, Luu had already flashed and disappeared into thin air. The wind God's feathered wings behind his back spread out recklessly. And after mastering the fusion rule characteristics, his speed at this moment was on a higher level than few mortals. He arrived in front of Chia Sha in the blink of an eye. "Just leave this Foreigner to me," Luu opened his mouth. He sensed that the situation of this Army Chief was not quite right. It was imposing, but his own breath was extraordinarily weak, as if it was a candle in the wind that might go out at any moment.

There was no doubt that it was fought to the last moment, utilizing the bloody burning secret method, he burned his life away. When Xia Sha heard this, his expression moved slightly, and he couldn't help but smile. Little Marshall Saint, are you planning to rob me of my military achievements? Lu, you were slightly stunned when he heard this. Of course, he could hear that this was still a joke. This person was afraid that he was already prepared to die, and at this moment, even with support, he still did not intend to leave alive. He would fight to the death, burned to the last moment. Lu was silent for a moment and spoke, "Let's join forces." Chia Sha readily agreed.

Watson looked at Luu with fear and without hesitation, he turned around and fled. Escape! Just now, in that sword, he saw something. The sixth realm genius was simply too fierce. It was even if he mastered two types of rule characteristics, but he also completely fused the two types of rule characteristics, which was what made Damon have no room to struggle. And was directly beheaded. Watson's speed of retreat was fast, but Luu's outburst was even faster. At the moment, as his wind God feathered wings revved up directly blocking Watson's path of retreat, die! Chia Sha shouted angrily, his head full of silver hair flying, as he directly swung his sword to strike Luu on the other side. Likewise, did not hesitate and directly swung his sword to pull chopping God.

In fact, Chia Sha alone, after utilizing the bloody burning secret method, his strength was able to crush Watson. It was only because his Chi and blood had decayed and was about to burn out that he was unable to cut him down in a short period of time. At this moment, combining with Luu, how could this eighth realm De Mag God resist? No doubt about it, once again. One fell. Rumble. This time, it was only a few thunderbolts, and before it even rained, Watson's Earth rule origin was sucked into the flame of civilization by Luu. The vision gone! L, you blinked, as more and more eighth realm foreign races were killed. The speed at which the flame of civilization absorbed the Ru Ence seemed to be getting faster and faster. If he absorbed it a few more times, maybe after beheading the eighth realm Fay, it wouldn't even Thunder and not even Heaven and Earth anomalies would appear.

I'm going to the other side to help Luu. Luu glanced at Chow Shia, then instantly disappeared in place, hearing Luu's words. Chia Sha then withdrew from the state of the bloodb burning secret method. His figure swayed and he almost fell from midair. Xia Sha raised his head and looked at the direction Lu left. He couldn't help but sigh softly in admiration. I didn't expect to see the little Marshall Sage like this before I die. It's worth it. Ha ha, no regrets. Two De Mag Gods had fallen, this was simply a devastating blow to the sanctuary, civilization's army. And the formation, which was already slightly chaotic, was completely thrown into disarray. At this moment, in the midst of that chaos, a few human traitors couldn't help but stare at this scene. Their hearts filled with sadness. How could it be that they had just surrendered to the sanctuary civilization and the support of the human race? It was even if the support came, but it also destroyed the battlefield, decimating 2 eighth realm powerhouses in a row, directly rewriting the battlefield. Why, why couldn't you have come earlier? Is it too late to go back to the human team and pretend nothing happened? However, not waiting for them to go back, the ones who had their powers imprisonment were no different from ordinary people. And at this moment, they died directly in tragically at the feet of the foreigners, and were trampled to death alive just like that.

In the meantime, the last De Mag good Powerhouse, Yabu, didn't even have the heart to fight at this moment and turned around to escape. He turned into a gust of wind and instantly detached himself from the battlefield. Wind rule controller, stop him. Seeing this, Luu hurriedly transmitted a message to the Legion Commander, Shha.

Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately employed the blood-burning, enigmatic technique, and his speed instantly soared, halting the retreat of this Demigod Powerhouse. "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!" Yabo hissed, fearful. "I am the son of a God. You cannot kill me. If you kill me, the true God will surely send down punishment. You will all die, son of the true God."

Hearing this threat, Lu couldn't help but laugh. "Nine Realms? How can you call yourself a god?"

Chapter 233: Sword Beheading Three Demigods

In the vast universe beyond the SE secret realm, the existences that could be called true gods were without exception all 10-realm powerhouses. However, in this Taiway mysterious realm, the ninth realm was called a true God. As for that true existence of the 10th realm, it was called the God King. Information coming back from the troops at this Outpost revealed that the Sanctuary civilization in this secret realm had originated from many reincarnations ago and was already quite remarkable that they had survived here to this day and still managed to develop to this size. It was not an easy thing to have a ninth-realm Powerhouse appear, and it was reasonable to dare to call oneself a true God.

When the true God's son, Yabo, heard these words, he stared slightly and then his face became extraordinarily brilliant. His identity as the son of a true God could be said to be unbeatable. Even the powerhouses of the Cenu civilization and the Ancient Market civilization, who were as powerful as water and fire, after learning of his identity, all had to be polite and courteous to him and did not dare to lay a hand on him at all. After all, who dares to incur the hatred of a true God?

Simply tired of living in his mind, his father had always been the Supreme Being, even though he had become a Demigod Powerhouse, he still thought so. Yet now, in this little guy's mouth, he actually said something like "nine Realms only." Is it also worthy of being called a god? This is a direct reversal of Yabo's three views. He's broken his defense a bit. "Infidel! How dare you disrespect the great true God! I'm going to die with you so you'll know that the great true God is not to be dishonored!" Yabo roared in anger, then immediately used his secret technique, about to blow himself up on the spot.

When Lu saw this, he immediately launched his sword on the other side. "Stand down!" The one who had blocked Yabo's retreat followed suit. If Yabu really succeeded in blowing himself up, it would be no joke. Whether it was him or the little Marshall Saint, even if he didn't die, it was still very bad.

Boom! Boom! Terrifying rule fluctuations spread unchecked, and countless soldiers of the Sanctuary Army who were fleeing prostrated themselves on the ground in fear. No doubt about it, another eighth-realm Demigod had fallen. Among them, there was even the true God's son, Yabu. Rumble, the thunder struck only once, not even gathering dark clouds, and the vision disappeared. Seeing this scene, Legion Commander Sher couldn't help but TSK in amazement. "What kind of tactics did the little Marshall Saint use? It was actually impossible to even manifest a vision in the meantime."

Chiaa looked at the battle in the distance and couldn't help but sigh with emotion when he saw Liu teaming up with SH. "Magnificent! Magnificent!" With the stature of the sixth realm, to behead 38-realm powerhouses in a row can truly be said to have no predecessors and no successors. Little Marshall Saint is truly the future of the human race."

Xia Sha revealed a contented look and slowly closed his eyes, then his body fell from the sky. Legionnaire Deputy head Yen Jing Yu hurriedly flew over in K Chow sha. Those martial artists from the human outposts who had fought bloodily until now and were still alive saw the scene and immediately realized what was happening. In that instant, everyone's eyes went red. "Legionnaire! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"

A bloody Road erupted at this moment, the crowd which was already exhausted to the extreme suddenly erupted with terrifying battle power. There's a saying, "Woe is me when everyone is grieving, it can instead Inspire unprecedented potential." This day in the middle of the battlefield at The Outpost, the Sanctuary civilization in succession had fallen three Demigod powerhouses, losing hundreds of thousands of troops at the same time. Most of the soldiers in fact didn't die in battle, they just didn't dare to go back. Even the son of the true God died, but they went back alive, and the consequences were self-evident. Almost all of the soldiers who had become deserters either went Incognito or defected to the Immortal Feather civilization as well as the Ancient Market civilization.

For the Sanctuary civilization, there is no doubt that the damage was heavy. If we add the Golden General at the beginning, then a total of four demigods died before and after. When the news spread, it immediately caused a fury in a short period of time. This news is so explosive you can't even cover it if you want to. For a moment, it triggered a violent Tremor throughout the Sanctuary civilization. All Demigod powerhouses without exception were confused after hearing this news.

In the sanctuary civilization, Demag goods held a highly esteemed status, despite the ongoing fires of war between the three major civilizations. Demigod level existences seldom fell during this time; however, the unthinkable occurred when two Demag powerhouses perished simultaneously. The news was devastating.

In the Hall of the God King, the great being who reigned with supreme power, the true God of the sanctuary civilization, was enraged. His eyes erupted in flames, and he roared in anger, "My son, Yabu, has been killed! The crime is unforgivable! I will make them understand the wrath of a true God!" He commanded his subordinates to find and eliminate the perpetrators. The angry roar of the true God echoed throughout the Divine Capital, causing the entire city to tremble.

The news reached the other two civilizations on the continent, the Immortal Feather civilization and the Ancient Market civilization. They were shocked and delighted to hear the news. The shock was due to the number of demigods that had fallen, while the joy stemmed from the sanctuary civilization's misfortune. To them, this was an opportunity to take advantage of the sanctuary civilization's weakened state. However, they knew that assisting the sanctuary civilization was out of the question.

Meanwhile, a temporary station shielded from detection signals was discovered. The Shinra probes of the sanctuary civilization could not detect this place without actively exploring it. The area was deemed safe for the time being.

In the medical area, a group of exhausted and wounded men stood around a makeshift ward. The captain of the medical squad looked at the men, wanting to say something, but decided against it. These men were giving their legionnaire one last ride, and it was not a good idea to interrupt.

In the ward, several seventh realm martial artists, as well as the deputy head, Yen Jingu, had reddened eyes as they looked at Chia Sha, the Army Chief, who was dying on the hospital bed. Just then, Chia Sha slowly opened his eyes and spoke in a thin voice, "Yen Jingu, I'm in."

Yen Jingu hurriedly got down and put his ear to the Army Chief's mouth, knowing that he was not long for this world and could die at any moment. Chia Sha spoke softly, "Legionnaire, please don't say that. I said a long time ago that the destiny of a martial artist is to die on the battlefield. What's more, the little Marshall Saint and I teamed up to kill an eighth realm. That's already enough. Leave me alone. I want to rest alone."

After saying these words, Chia Sha slowly closed his eyes. Yen Jingu instantly realized something and opened his eyes in shock. Just then, a figure that no one expected walked into the makeshift hospital room. It was the little Marshall Saint, Liu Chow.

Chia Sha, who had already closed his eyes, thought that he had blurred his vision when he saw Liu Chow coming over. He opened his eyes and looked at Liu Chow with some doubts. Liu Chow looked at Chia Sha on the hospital bed, who had a head full of white hair and a withered, dying face, and spoke softly, "Legion Commander Chia Sha, I've heard about you. I don't think you should die here. Eat this."

Liu Chow stuffed a blackish pill into Chia Sha's mouth. Once it was in his mouth and slightly swallowed, it transformed into a warm current that entered his stomach and gradually spread to all his limbs and bones. However, nothing happened in the ward. Chia Sha was still dead, his breath completely gone. The deputy head, Yen Jingu, and several other seventh realm martial artists were filled with anticipation when they heard Liu Chow's words. However, all their anticipation was completely dashed in the next second.

Chief Yen Jinu's eyes widened as he felt the legion commander's breath leave him. He couldn't help but glance at Luu, his eyes filled with doubt. "Didn't Junior Marshall Saint attempt to save him, or is it too late?" he thought.

Other seventh realm powerhouses spoke up, asking the same question. Liu had just said that they thought the army chief was saved, but it seemed the legionnaire was still dead. The charts showed an unlikely scenario, but Yen Jing Yu couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. No matter what, Junior Marshall Saint had tried his best, using the blood burning mysterious technique to save the legion commander.

However, even if the rescue had failed, Yen Jing Yu couldn't help but admire the young marshall's intentions. It was a shame that the legion commander's life essence had been burned out, and ordinary treasures wouldn't be able to cure him.

Luu sniffed and didn't say anything, staring at the already dead Chow Sha. Just now, Luu had given Chow Sha an Elixir, the Ninth Revolution Soul Restoration pill. The effect of the pill was that if taken within 24 hours, it would reverse any irreversible damage to the body, returning the soul to life and repairing all damage.

Yen Jing Yu wondered if it would still be possible to come back to life with the life essence burned out. For Luu, who possessed the soul seal, this Elixir was slightly more effective in a life-and-death situation. However, the Elixir's grade wasn't high, and it wasn't widely used. For the Marshall King Realm of the eighth realm, it would no longer produce an effect, not to mention for a ninth realm existence like Master Sh.

Just as everyone was in silence, Chow Sha, who had originally lost his breath, suddenly opened his eyes and sat up directly. It was as if he had been holding his breath for a long time, and he couldn't help but breathe heavily. Not only that, but his head full of silver-white hair had gradually become black.

Chow Sha looked at his palm and felt the energy that was constantly being restored in his body. For a moment, his jaw dropped. The people in the ward were all stunned, their faces filled with shock and disbelief. "It's a fraud," some whispered, but others shouted, "He's coming back to life! The legionnaire is resurrected! It really worked!"

Luu let out a sigh of relief and spoke with a smile. Yen Jinu's eyes widened as he turned his head to look at the little marshall saint. "Is this due to that pill that the little marshall saint just took to have such a terrifying effect?" he thought. "Then what level of treasure is that?"

There was a tremor in Yen Jinu's voice as he asked about the treasure's origin. To reverse death and restore the body to its original state, and to restore the life essence again, the treasure's effect was unheard of. It was truly horrifying, and Yen Jinu found it hard to believe that the little marshall saint had casually fed such a treasure to the legion commander.

Luu nodded and said with emotion, "However, it's worth it to give it to a hero like Army Chief Chow Sha." With these words, Luu was sincere.

At that moment, Xia Sha heard these words and raised his head to look at Luu. Without the slightest hesitation, Xia Sha directly got up, knelt down on one knee, and performed the ancient military salute of Dashia, which was the etiquette to express the highest respect. Although this etiquette had been abolished long ago, Xia Sha was a retro person at heart.

"Since this life of mine was given to me by little marshall saint, from now on, I will be at little marshall saint's disposal. Only little marshall saint's head will be at my disposal," Xia Sha said.

From then on, everyone inside and outside the room knelt down on one knee at the call of the little marshall saint. They would only look up to the little marshall saint. The 57 people other than Xia Sha opened their mouths almost in unison, pledging their loyalty to the little marshall saint. After experiencing the bloody battle at the outpost, these more than 500 people had turned into a community, sharing the same mind and tacit understanding. Luu had taken out that treasure and saved the life of army chief Chow Sha, allowing his burnt-out life essence to be restored.

To recover such a valuable treasure, there's no doubt it must be extremely precious. Little Marshall Saint, however, downplayed the situation, stating that a hero like Legionaire Chow deserved it. But here's the thing: everyone has a personal scale of value. This unheard-of treasure, if not for Little Marshall Saint, might not have been retrieved even if a Marshall Emperor had arrived personally. This must be the life-saving ace card left by Marshall Saint for Little Marshall Saint. Now, Little Marshall Saint decided to take it out and give it to Legion Chief CH. What if, in the future, Little Marshall Saint is in danger? Such a treasure would be used to save others instead of himself. In other words, Little Marshall Saint would risk his own life rather than save Legion Chief Chow's.

The crowd wondered if it was worth it. They couldn't deny that compared to Little Marshall Saint's safety, Legion Chief Chia's life was insignificant. Little Marshall Saint was the future of the human race, yet he still retrieved the treasure to save the Army Chief's life. What kind of favor is this? How can it be repaid? Lu, slightly stunned, listened to the crowd's voices. He never expected that after saving Legion Chief Chia, Little Marshall Saint had gained complete reverence from the crowd. Lu urged Shia to stand up, but Shia remained kneeling, saying that if Little Marshall Saint didn't agree, he wouldn't rise. This prompted others to follow suit.

Little Marshall Saint's actions left Lu speechless. He eventually agreed, promising that as the lord of the 138 stars of the Taiway Star Domain, he would need warriors like them. If they were willing to follow him, they should join him. As long as there was food for him, they would also have their share. Lu assured that he didn't make empty promises. With these words, the crowd stood up, smiling. From that day on, they were all followers of Little Marshall Saint.

Some of them had climbed the pole to show their loyalty, as Legion Commander Chow had sacrificed his life to repay Xia Sha. However, this wasn't necessary for others. Little Marshall Saint, the son of Marshall Saint and the future Marshall Saint, was the hope of humanity. They had witnessed his incredible strength in the battlefield, beheading 38th realm foreigners. Following Legion Commander Chow and being close to Little Marshall Saint was a double win. This was undoubtedly a better path.

Legion Commander Chia Sha expressed gratitude for the treasure Little Marshall Saint provided, which had brought many changes to his body. He believed that with this newfound strength, he could break through to the eighth realm soon. Lu congratulated Chia Sha in advance, attributing his success to Little Marshall Saint's blessing. Chia Sha acknowledged that without the precious medicine, he wouldn't be where he was. Breaking through the eighth realm earlier was the best way to repay Little Marshall Saint's favor.

Lu recalled Little Marshall Saint's impressive feats, including defeating 127th, 496th, and 21st realm foreigners, as well as an eighth realm foreigner alone and teaming up with Legion Commander Chia to defeat another eighth realm foreigner. On behalf of all human martial artists, Lu expressed his high honor to Little Marshall Saint. As a result, Little Marshall Saint gained 3 million milit points and 3 million contribution value points, and his rank was raised from Major to General. Although Lu didn't put much importance on the title, the speed at which he advanced was remarkable. Little Marshall Saint's achievements were undeniable.

In the secret world, the Fay are incredibly wealthy, especially the son of the true God. Lu You alone had acquired two rule crystals, while two other eth realm powerhouses each had two rule crystals. One of them, killed by Lu You alone, deserved to be his alone. The other, killed with Chia Sha's help, could only share one with him. Chia Sha was adamant about not wanting it, but Lu You thought it was necessary and took it. This was equivalent to a credit for saving his life, and since Chia Sha was under his banner, it was better to leave it for him to break through the eighth realm.
In summary, Lu You's body now had a total of five rule crystals. Within his body, there were four types of rule origin attached to the Flame of Civilization: the rule origin of gold, characterized by toughness; the rule origin of water, characterized by healing; the rule origin of Earth, with unknown characteristics; and the rule origin of wind, also with unknown characteristics. If one could utilize the rule crystal and master all of these rule origins, Lu You's strength would definitely soar once again.
As for the characteristics of the rule of wind, the temporary station was safe for the time being, but it was not something to be taken lightly. Lu You and the others had killed 48th realm demigods in a single day, which was an extremely huge loss for the entire Sanctuary civilization. Among those four Demigods, there was also a son of a true God. There is no doubt that it must have set off shock waves that shook even the entire civilization violently.
Even though they could not be found for the time being, the Sanctuary civilization would never give up their search once they found out where they were. They would certainly do everything in their power to retaliate back. This was almost a predictable scenario.
As an outpost of the human race, the crowd had one main task besides their support mission, and that was to explore as much information as possible about all aspects of this continent. Rather than fighting with the Sanctuary civilization, which was not something they needed to do, it was necessary to avoid the battle as much as possible.
Thoroughly lurking in a slightly Spartan but clean room, Lu You sat cross-legged and began the retreat. He looked at the four rule origins in the Flame of Civilization within his body, feeling their subtle fluctuations and the subtle to extreme flavor: gold, water, Earth, and wind.
I also wonder after consuming these five rule crystals will it be possible to fully grasp these four types of rule origin? The thought flashed through Lu You's mind. Right now, his strength when placed in the eight realms was not particularly strong. Although he had already killed several eighth realm powerhouses, it was more by virtue of the fusion power of the Sword Da Rule and the rule of gold that he had some advantage in attacking. If he encountered a truly difficult opponent, such as the peak of the eighth realm, Lu You wouldn't be able to fight at all.
It seems to be true that the Sanctuary civilization is a bit of a dish in the eth realm. However, it would be inappropriate to treat all of the eight realms of the Sanctuary civilization as if they were vegetable chickens. If that were true, it would be impossible to give birth to the nine realms. The Masters are few but definitely not none. Nine times out of 10, Lu You would encounter it in his next adventure. If you take a chance, you are likely to suffer a big loss. That's why it's a top priority to improve your strength as much as possible.
He's not strong enough without much thought, Lu You took out a rule crystal from the Chin Kuin Treasure Pearl with a thought. The pure rule origin power slowly entered his body, and Lu You's physical body strength also received a small increase, which could be described as a 100ft pole, one step further. This collateral effect alone was no less than many treasures that enhanced the physical body. Rule crystals were just too good, the only downside being that they were too expensive.
It's not right either to say that expensive is a disadvantage of people. Lu You shook his head and threw the distracting thoughts out of his mind. Feeling the four rule origins on the Flame of Civilization, Lu You immediately began to Enlighten himself.
After a long time, on the Flame of Civilization, the rule origin of gold gradually disappeared. At the same time, Lu You mastered the toughness trait. Relying on this rule characteristic, Lu You's defense ability would be raised to another level. He cultivated the way of Flesh to sainthood, and his fleshly body was already extremely powerful. With the addition of toughness, at this moment, it was even stronger. With this kind of Defense ability, I'm afraid that an ordinary eighth realm would not be able to break through the defense when they hit him.
Right, more ability to stay alive is a good thing. Lu You then glanced at the rule crystal and realized that the rule origin energy inside had only been consumed by a third. At this rate, it wouldn't even take five rule crystals to put these four types of rule

Luu immediately began to understand the origin of water. Then, he realized that his initial thoughts were too simplistic. Enlightening the origin of the rule of gold, Luu's comprehension was indeed swift, but this did not mean that comprehending the origins of other attributes would be equally fast. The reason for this is straightforward: talent biases differ. 

Luu studied under Jai Wuan and practiced the Way of the Sword, the Way of Killing, which aligns with the origin of gold and its characteristic sharpness, which is easily grasped. Even the fusion of shop and sharpness was not overly difficult, accomplished by consuming a rule crystal. Similarly, stepping out of the Way of Flesh Sainthood, which is very much in line with toughness, made comprehension exceptionally smooth. However, the water origin was different; it did not fit well with Luu himself. With the help of Tiue Immortal Cells and the Tiue Diffractive Dharma Pill, comprehension was still possible, though the progress was not too slow. But achieving the fluidity and surging forward of the gold origin was clearly impossible. The consumption of cultivation and time was exponentially increased.

Luu frowned. He had underestimated the cultivation of the rule origin. Reflecting on this, he realized that a rule origin is inherently complex. Luu pondered for a moment and decisively gave up on comprehending the water origin. He then turned to the other two origins: the origin of Earth and the origin of wind. Earth and wind, he thought of his natural aptitude. Could the God Feathered Wings, a wind deity, comprehend the origin of the wind rule? Just try, Lou.

Luu enumerated the rule origin of wind, and indeed, it was somewhat better to comprehend than the water origin, though not as smooth as the gold origin. At least, the speed was not slow, but the consumption was greater, requiring one and a half rule crystals. Only then did Luu master the wind origin's characteristic, named Freedom. Freedom's effect was simple and literal: to be free and unconstrained, not bound. Whether it was a domain or a world, it could be easily broken free. This was not just an increase in pure speed; it was a change in essence.

Though distressed by the consumption of one and a half rule crystals, since it granted the rule trait of Freedom, it was clearly worth it. Freedom is a great thing, Luu's eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but murmur, "Wind God Feathered Wings. If paired with the Freedom characteristic, even if you can't beat those P realm powerhouses, you should be able to escape easily. Not bad, really good. I'm much better at staying alive when the retreat is over."

Luu planned to leave the temporary base and go out to explore an adventure. On one hand, it was to acquire more treasures and resources, and on the other, to complete the system's exploration quests. Getting this Freedom at this moment was like getting wings. Thinking this way, Luu once again looked at the civilization flame within his body. The rule origin had not disappeared yet, as there was still a rule characteristic that had not been comprehended. The party had already glimpsed the true nature of the E Freedom, an attack-type rule trait, and its name was Cutting. Feeling the rule characteristics of this door, Luu did not hesitate and immediately took out the rule crystals to continue his enlightenment.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. After consuming two entire rule crystals, Luu had only managed to master the other characteristic of the wind origin. This huge consumption made Luu helpless. Before and after, nearly four rule crystals were consumed, enumerating three rule characteristics: toughness, freedom, and cutting. Originally, he had thought to rely on these five rule crystals to directly master the four types of rule origins. In hindsight, he was still overthinking it. The consumption for the unfit Earth origin and water origin would be even more terrifying. No wonder there were very few eighth realm powerhouses that used rule crystals to cultivate. Not only was the price high, but the output ratio was too low. This thing is not even something the eighth realm can play with. The only way to use rule crystals was to be in the ninth realm, and no ordinary ninth realm would do so; it had to be some of the stronger ninth realms.

Luu shook his head. He felt the rule characteristic of cutting and a thought immediately arose: does it blend with chop and sharp? Luu vaguely felt that it was possible, but the difficulty was very high. The difficulty of fusing two rules was high enough, and the fusion of three rules was even more difficult. But once successfully fused, a qualitative change is bound to occur. Luu's offensive ability would undoubtedly improve.

Luu categorically decided to take things to the next level. He glanced at the remaining rule crystals; there was one intact and one nearly depleted. This amount was insufficient to support Luu in infusing these three rules. "I'll borrow some from Legionnaire," he said. "Sure, as long as Luu is willing to ask, I'm naturally willing to lend," Sha replied. However, the problem was that even with just Shera's meager supply of rule crystals, it was still impossible to complete the fusion of the three rule characteristics. Luu roughly estimated that he would need at least ten rule crystals, or even more, to achieve this. This was too difficult for Luu at his current stage.

Of course, there was another way: to return and request them from Pup. Surely, that Marshall Sage could afford to give them. But the problem was that this back-and-forth journey was too time-consuming. The trip back to the Blue Star from the Taiway Star Domain was far, with the Wormhole flight alone taking 12 days, plus the closed-door cultivation. By the time he returned, it would be more than a month later. His adventure had just begun, and it felt like a waste of time to make a trip back.

Once the mission to support the Outpost was successfully completed and the temporary base was well hidden, the events that had transpired were relayed back to the War Fortress outside the secret realm. "Support Mission successfully completed. Good, good, good," the secret realm's chief commander, Hong, couldn't help but nod. He knew very well how difficult this mission truly was. If one wasn't careful, both the outpost team and the support team could be wiped out. Luckily, such a situation didn't occur, and the mission was completed without even triggering the Little Marshall Saint's Soul seal.

Huntsman continued to examine the intel. "A large force from the Outpost, dead or wounded, not one in ten. Including Legion Commander Chiaa, there are only 508 people left." Even Huntsman couldn't help but be moved. He could almost imagine the ferocity of the battlefield at the Outpost. Soon, he saw Luu again, amidst the battlefield, slaying 38 Rome foreigners in a row, one of them being the son of a true God of the Sanctuary Civilization. "38th realm beheadings in a row, there's also a son of a true God among them," Huntsman exclaimed.

Hong and Marshall King You Fone beside him were somewhat shocked when they saw this news. "38th realm demigods, and they were actually chopped up just like that, sounds like a breeze," Hong said. However, both Hong and Yon were well aware of the difficulty involved as well as the violent shocks that followed. "Little Marshall Saint, that's really outrageous," Yon couldn't help but spit out. "To actually behead 38th realm demigods with such ease."

"Yes, I'm afraid the Sanctuary Civilization is going crazy," Hong nodded. "I hope they can hide well and never be discovered. Only a few more months at most, half a year, when the eighth realm powerhouses are able to enter, we in this sacred realm civilization will be on the offensive and defensive. It will take a bit longer for a ninth realm powerhouse to get in, but the eighth realm should be enough. There are quite a few Peak eighth realm in the human race that can easily defeat a ninth realm existence."

"This Taiway secret realm, siphoning off the energy of the entire Taiway Starfield, has caused this vast Starfield to be so barren, making it so difficult for our human race to defend in the Starfield Battlefield. After sucking blood for so long, it's time to make them pay."

"From a long, long time ago, the human race's exploration of the Taiway Starfield had basically never stopped. This vast Starfield, spanning two million light-years, bordered three powerful civilization clusters and also bordered dozens of weaker civilization clusters. Such a huge area, but so barren and desolate. Countless Starfield Scholars kept researching and searching, just wanting to find the secret realm and find this energy thief so that the pressure on the human Frontier front was not so great. But alas, until a short time ago, there were no results. Ever since Luu obtained that Ray of Civilization Fire, things had finally taken a turn for the better. In fact, the danger of developing the secret realm never lay in the secret realm itself, but in the covetousness of the other three powerful civilizations. If they were to know about the matter of the Taiway Mysterious Realm, there was no doubt that they would definitely attack at all costs. Even if they couldn't snatch the Taiway Mysterious Realm, they would still have to completely mess up the human race's plan to develop the mysterious realm. The Evil God Clan, as well as the Holy Spirit Clan, and the Blood Moon Clan, these three powerful Clans would definitely not stand by and watch as the human Taiway Astral Domain grew in strength with the Taiway Mysterious Realm. Therefore, the matter of developing the Taiway secret realm could be said to be a race against time. Even if the martial artists of the Outpost lost a lot as a result, they had at least brought back a lot of information. Then it was all worth it. This is the struggle of the great world and civilization, not some kind of housekeeping. Even being slightly more indecisive would lead to death and the destruction of countless human planets. As a result, Luu is out of the gate, Legion Commander Chia sha immediately came over.

Here is the rewritten text:

LuYou reported to XiaSha about everything that had occurred recently, both large and small matters in the temporary base, since he had chosen to serve XiaSha. Naturally, XiaSha wouldn't take this lightly, even though he had already broken through to the Eighth Realm. XiaSha listened attentively to one thing after another, then spoke to XiaSha about his thoughts. Little Marshall Saint was planning to embark on an adventure, and XiaSha revealed an unexpected look of surprise. "Chapter 238," it seemed.

"It's so similar, so familiar," XiaSha said, seeming to grasp the situation.

Liu nodded in agreement. If that were the case, XiaSha felt it was reasonable, and he pondered for a moment before offering a few suggestions. One, he advised Lu to learn the language of the Sanctuary Civilization and understand its cultural nuances. Two, he suggested Lu change his original appearance and manifest a costume of the Sanctuary Civilization. Three, it was a good idea to prepare for the adventure beforehand and have several contingency plans in place.

Listening to XiaSha's suggestions, LuYou was a bit surprised and couldn't help but ask, "How do I learn their language?" XiaSha smiled and said that they had captured prisoners from the Sanctuary Civilization and had cracked their language, so XiaSha could share some of the relevant knowledge and cultural differences with LuYou.

As for adventure planning, XiaSha could also come up with a few ideas for Little Marshall Saint to consider. Of course, it was up to LuYou to decide whether or not to adopt them.

ChiaSha is very capable," LuYou thought to himself after XiaSha had voiced his ideas. "He doesn't stop at having ideas, but also thinks through every detail for me, so I don't have to worry about it. It's not perfectly prepared, but at least it's reliable."

As LuYou listened to XiaSha's narration, he couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude in his heart. It was really convenient to have someone like XiaSha working for him, especially someone with XiaSha's abilities. LuYou's name may be loud and clear, but he doesn't have his own forces or a subordinate who belongs to him. However, whenever he wants to do something, he either has to rely on his master's forces or the help of his brothers and sisters, who are heroes of the Great Summer. It's still more or less inconvenient to accomplish things on his own.

LuYou had also thought about forming his own Force, but before he wasn't strong enough to form a force, so it was only natural that he had no way to form a force. However, that's obviously different now. He has grown up and although he's in the Sixth Realm, he possesses the battle power of the Eighth Realm, and he's the lord of the 138 planets in the TaiWay Star Domain. In the future, if he wants to become the spokesperson of the TaiWay Star Region, then he would definitely need to have his own forces under his command.

It's this group of people, as well as the many martial artists who have survived the battle of The Outpost, who would form the backbone of his forces. LuYou didn't care about it previously, but now he realizes its importance, and it's too late to change anything now.

After realizing the importance of this matter, LuYou spent the next few days preparing and learning the language of the Sanctuary Civilization while making contact with the 507 martial artists. He intended to talk to each person, memorize each person's name, and remember each person's general personality, preferences, and family situation. As a super-social cow, LuYou was able to easily mix with them and get along with them.

This was not really that difficult, after all. LuYou is far beyond this group of people in terms of his status, position, or natural talent, even with the title of Major General and the insights he has in military warfare. Although XiaAn felt that LuYou has no talent in military matters and is really an elm brain that couldn't be taught in any way, it doesn't mean that LuYou really doesn't have a level; he's just relatively speaking.

When LuYou sat amongst the crowd and told them about the major battles of long ago, he directly mesmerized the crowd, and all of them were mesmerized, itching to travel back and take part in that magnificent, large-scale war to defend the Majesty of the human race. Compared to battles of civilized communities like that, the bloody battle they had fought at The Outpost, while also magnificent, is simply not enough in terms of spectacle.

The great battle that determined the status and future of the human Community is naturally something that the crowd had heard of long ago, and there were similar stories in school books, military books, and even movies and TV shows since they were young. However, everyone was still hearing this version of LuYou for the first time. LuYou is a great storyteller at this moment, and as he spoke, he became excited himself, even though he himself had subbed in, let alone this group of martial artists.

In order to go out and brag about it, Liu looked at that time with extraordinary attentiveness, coupled with the unforgettable talent, so every story in every battle that his master told him, L, he had clearly remembered. In the meantime, when Legion Commander Chia Sha and Vice Commander Yen Jing Yu saw the scene, they couldn't help but be a little surprised originally. They were a little worried that this group of reckless and accustomed fellows, who were straight-talking, would cause the little Marshall Saint to be displeased and make things not too pleasant for each other. In hindsight, those fears could have been completely redundant. Although the little Marshall Saint had a noble status and great talent, he did not have the self-esteem of those super geniuses. Not to mention the habit of looking at people with his nostrils just for a while; he was acquainted with all of them, and the stories of those battles that he was talking about at the moment were even more captivating to all of them. It wasn't a simple skill, it was something so far-fetched that it was unbelievable.

Chia Sha was in a bit of a trance, as if he had seen the figure of that Marshall Saint back then, like what. Hearing this, Yen Jing Yu subconsciously asked, "Only then did Chia Sha come back to his senses." Smiling, he said, "The Marshall Saints of that year were people like little Marshall Saints, who never put on airs or stances, and could chat even with ordinary people." The army Chief looked surprised. "Has the army Chief seen a marshall Saint, Yen Jin Yu?" He was a bit surprised. "Aha, Chia Sha nodded, glanced at his palm and said with a smile, 'I even shook hands with the Marshall Saint back in the day. Really.'" Hearing this, Yen Jing Yu stared at him blankly, "How come you never said anything about this matter? What's there to brag about this kind of thing?"

Xia Sha shook his head in disbelief. "Is the Marshall Saint originally such a person?" Yen Jinu looked at Liu and couldn't help but murmur when the story came to a wonderful point. Liu suddenly stopped, just as everyone was waiting for Liu's following story. Liu, however, smiled and said, "This is the end of today's story. If everyone still wants to hear it, then I'll say it again tomorrow." Everyone's eyes widened at those words. Pioneer leader Wu Z Yuan hurriedly said, "Little Wuang, you should at least finish this story before you leave." Commando leader Wang dust nodded, "That's it, how can you break off in the middle of a sentence?"

The crowd could be said to be filled with righteous indignation, the atmosphere was instantly enlivened. Even those who did not dare to take the initiative to speak to Liu earlier all of them opened their mouths to speak at this moment. Medical Captain Hang laughed and said, "I won't be able to sleep tonight if you're like this, little Marshall Saint." Communication Captain Yia Fang also hurriedly spoke up, "Little Marshall Saint, you can't be like this, telling a story, how can you stop halfway through in the face of the crowds?" Repeated, please. Liu was indifferent. He smiled and said, "It's a long story, and I'm sure it can't be told in a moment. If we have to finish it, I'm afraid nothing will get done today, and it's not like I'm not saying that there's a long day ahead. So why are you all in a hurry?" I'm going to go work on something else. Bye, Lu. He said this and jumped down from the high stool, waving his hand towards the crowd before turning to leave.

The crowd was white-eyed, each one looking at the other. There was a bit of truth in Liu's words, "Yeah, there's a long day ahead. So why rush?" But the thing is, Fong, was halfway through this story, and just when it was getting exciting, it suddenly cut off. The little Marshall Saint definitely did it on purpose. By the time the crowd reacted, Lu was already far away and it was obviously too late to chase after him. The crowd started chatting at once. There were those who talked about the story of the battle in the party and those who talked about the little martial arts sage Liu. Just then, Legion Commander Chia Sha walked over. The discussion came to a screeching halt, as the head of the army, Cha's Majesty, was absolutely first class, and everyone respected, loved, and feared him. Shia Sha looked around the crowd. The teams stationed at The Outpost were meant to be the elite of the elite. The Outpost Battlefield is even more tragic to the extreme. One out of ten, and everyone who stays is a ruthless man among ruthless men. Treating such a group of people in addition to drawing closer to them, Liu naturally did not begrudge sharing meat. He was extraordinarily generous and gave Legion Commander Cho Sha a lot of cultivation materials, allowing the crowd to focus on cultivation. The requirements were simple. Try to break through to the new realm. Everyone's General realm was still on the low side. Most were at the peak of the fifth realm, a few were at the sixth realm, and even fewer were at the seventh realm. Those in the fifth realm to break through to the sixth realm. Those in the sixth realm to break through to the seventh realm. And those in the seventh realm to break through to the eighth realm. This request shouldn't be too much. Right when Xia Sha spoke this matter out, all the martial artists immediately grimaced bitterly, breaking through this kind of thing it was so easy to say. If it was that easy, it wouldn't have been stuck for so many years.

In the years when Xia Sha witnessed this scene, he immediately rebuked, "You've crossed the life and death barrier, yet you're still fearful of a cultivation breakthrough. Little Marshall Saint has high expectations for you, so don't let me or Little Marshall Saint down. Anyone who fails to make a breakthrough is the one who disgraces me. The Little Marshall Saint thinks highly of you all. How old is the Little Marshall Saint? He is, and he's already broken through to the sixth realm, even killing numerous eight Realms. From now on, you're all Little Marshall Saint's soldiers. If you still adhere to the old standards, don't blame me for not reminding you that you can leave before it's too late."

The legion Commander's words left the crowd in disbelief. They stared at each other, questioning the comparison to Little Marshall Saint. Although they were once considered geniuses, they were truly insignificant compared to Little Marshall Saint. However, the Legion Commander was right. From now on, they were Little Marshall Saint's soldiers, so how could they hold themselves to the same standards as before?

Everyone knew that following Little Marshall Saint had an unlimited future, but if everyone laid flat, even an unlimited future would be ruined. As a result, everyone clenched their teeth and broke through.

In the following days, Xia Sha discovered that many people had broken through one after another. It seemed that the bloody Battle At The Outpost was an unprecedented crisis for these people and an opportunity to stimulate their potential. After breaking the life and death barrier, they all comprehended something - a seventh realm desolate Beast with a huge body that resembled a mountain peak. It was the absolute Dominator of hundreds of nearby mountains. All the desolate beasts they had to survive under its snout just then.

The sword light flashed, so fast that this seventh realm desolate Beast didn't even react. Its eyes were filled with bewilderment and shock as it found that the life core in its body had been sliced in half. Boom! The desolate Beast with a huge body collapsed with a loud bang, instantly overpowering countless trees and scaring away all the wild beasts within a thousand mile radius.

Luu appeared at the head of this desolate beast and commanded the others to dismember it. A seventh realm desolate Beast, even if the chunks of meat that contained Pure Energy were not much, only about 1,000 lb, there were also some parts of the meat that had a decent amount of energy and were barely a meal in bits and pieces. You can probably get tens of thousands of pounds of meat from the rest of the parts, which are not really very useful. Put it directly here and leave it for the passing wild beasts and the wild birds. It's kind of their chance. This area is called the Billion Dollar Mountain or the Savage Land.

There was no doubt that the No Man's Land belonging to the sanctuary civilization was the paradise of the desolate beasts. These days, although the sanctuary civilization had searched frantically, it was still unable to find the human troops that were deliberately hiding with the Divine Luo detector useless. Trying to find the human team in these 1 billion mountains was no different from finding a needle in a haystack.

Just now, when he had beheaded this peak seventh realm desolate Beast, Luu had not even used a tenth of his strength to easily resolve it. Undoubtedly, after mastering three more rule characteristics, his overall strength had improved by leaps and bounds. While the others were cutting this seventh realm desolate Beast, Luu glanced at the system's Quest panel.

Stage two Quest: Explore 1% of the secret world and bring back Treasures of equal value. Mission reward: Concentration pill. Current progress: 037%.

During these days, Luu had nothing to do but explore everywhere in this Billion Dollar Mountain. Not for nothing, Luu had found quite a few exotic treasures and some natural mineral veins - kind of some good stuff for the average fifth realm, however, for Luu, it was not considered precious at all nor was it of much use. It was simply not enough.

Thinking about it, if there were Treasures all over this place, then the sanctuary civilization would have developed it long ago at all costs. It wouldn't be so bad that how many reincarnations had passed and it was still a Barren Wasteland. The dangers are far greater than the rewards, and this is a true reflection of the 1 billion mountains - the barbaric land. If you want more, you have to get out of the Billion Dollar Mountain, out of the mountains.

Chapter 240: Land of Divine Battle, Land of Blood Sacrifice

In terms of geography, the previous Outpost location was so much better than this Billion Dollar Mountain. Whether it was exploring the sacred realm civilization or going to the immortal feather civilization as well as the ancient ruins civilization, it was much more convenient. They had already been discovered over there and they had also killed 38 realm demigods over there, so naturally, they couldn't go back during this time.

Luu had already learned the language of the sanctuary Clan. The Scouting team also incidentally also deciphered the language of the Divine feather Clan as well as the ancient Market Clan. Being on the same continent, the languages of these three groups had certain similarities, so it wasn't too difficult to decipher.

Luu not only gained knowledge about the cultural practices and geographical customs of the Sanctuary Civilization, but he also became aware of various important details. He utilized the illusion bead to don the standard attire of the Sanctuary Civilization's nobles and manipulated his muscles to alter his appearance, making it resemble that of the Sanctuary Civilization's race. Furthermore, he adjusted his bone structure to appear slightly taller, transforming himself into a diminutive teenager instead of a small boy. Unless someone was intimately familiar with his scent, they would not recognize him as Luu after this transformation.

With these basic preparations in place, Luu was ready to depart from the Billion Dollar Mountain. Upon returning to his temporary camp, he fine-tuned his subsequent plan. It had not been easy to venture into this secret realm for an adventure, and he had been taking refuge in the Billion Mountains for safety. However, both the harvest and the progress of his mission had been slow, which was not Luu's style.

Luu had attained a high level of mastery over the rule of wind and the characteristics of the rule of gold. His natural divine ability, Wind God Feather, perfectly complemented the wind rule characteristic, Freedom, producing effects that surpassed those of the sword and gold rules. The combination of Wind God Feather, Freedom, White Jade Wind, and Fire Wheel yielded an extraordinary outcome.

In addition to speed, the defensive effect of the way of fleshly sainthood, combined with toughness, was equally impressive. Although Chop, Sharp, and Cut had yet to be fused, Luu's current offensive capabilities were still formidable. With Chop, Sharp, and Cut as an assist, his offense was equally terrifying. Speed, defense, and attack were now fully optimized and could not be improved further in the short term.

Luu decided it was time to make a significant move, even if it caused considerable trouble and could not be resolved in the end. He had the soul seal to cover it if necessary. If he were still looking ahead, it would have been better not to come to this Taiway Mysterious Realm, located at the border between the Sanctuary Civilization and the Immortal Feather Civilization.

This area was a vast battlefield where the two civilizations had agreed to wage war since time immemorial. The battlefield was soaked in blood, and the terrifying fury prevented even a seventh realm divine envoy from flying in the air. Only demigods who mastered the rules possessed the ability to fly. The fury had other uses as well. Some believers who were good by nature would become bloodthirsty and brutal after being invaded by the banful chi. In severe cases, they would become extraordinarily crazy.

In almost every war, there were heavy casualties and injuries on both sides. The soldiers who could leave this battlefield alive after killing until the end were considered a rare breed. Even if they survived, they would either go insane in their later years or retrace their steps on this battlefield and be killed. For ordinary soldiers, as soon as they set foot on this battlefield, there were only two outcomes: death or madness.

This negative effect did not affect everyone. Devotees of the fourth, fifth, and sixth realms were sheltered by the true God and could remain clear in the midst of endless madness. The divine ambassadors of the seventh realm were even more so, and under normal circumstances, there would hardly ever be a fall. As for the demigods of the eighth realm, only a handful had died in battle from ancient times to the present day. The only common soldiers were those in the third realm and below, who had nothing and could not walk out of the land of divine battle unharmed.

On this battlefield, both sides were ready to engage in combat. The Sanctuary Civilization had 3 million troops, while the Immortal Feather Civilization had an army of 2.7 million. All the soldiers at the bottom were infested with fury, their eyes red and flashing with murderous intent. As soon as they started to fight and kill, they would become completely crazy, charging and killing with no fear of death.

Luu could not help but furrow his brows when he saw the scene from afar. He realized that this so-called land of divine battle was nothing but a place of blood sacrifice. It seemed that the so-called deep hatred between the Sanctuary Civilization, the Immortal Feather Civilization, and the Ancient Ruins Civilization was nothing more than a facade.

This ongoing war is merely a smokescreen, a spectacle for the sake of blood sacrifice. Of course, there are also constant, festering wars and deep-seated grudges. But as for the true gods of these three great civilizations, I fear they won't concern themselves with such hatreds. They will only care about the results of this endless bloodshed.

The situations Lu You encounters remind him of the outer Universe, where fallen gods from the ten realms incite wars among civilized groups, spreading conflict throughout the universe. This same situation presents itself in this secret realm, the Taiway, whether it be in the San Ary civilization, the Immortal Feather civilization, the Ancient Ruins civilization, or the other six civilizations outside of this Divine Ruins continent.

The path of the fallen evil god does not require the tenth realm. As long as one is at the peak of the ninth realm, they can walk this path to extend their life. The evil gods of these three great civilizations control the billions of trillions of lives within the secret realm, sending them to this land of divine battles to consume in a steady stream, sustaining themselves for eternity.

Chapter 241: Out of the Box Stance, a Sword to Cut Down a Demon God

Regardless of the birth or destruction of the universe, no matter how many times it is reincarnated, there will always be a group of evil gods living in this secret realm, even at the cost of countless lives. The question is, in the face of constant death and despair, will a hero emerge? In time, there will surely be one hero after another, breaking through hardships and obstacles, eventually defeating the evil gods and saving civilization from destruction.

But the scene at this moment proves one thing: either the hero dies and a new evil dragon appears, or you become a dragon slayer or an evil dragon yourself. With this thought, Lu You no longer hesitates. He flaps his wings and instantly disappears, reappearing in the sky above the divine battleground, amidst the battlefield where the two armies face off.

Millions of troops from both sides look up and see Lu You, standing on the White Jade wind and fire wheel, holding the Jie Shen Chang sword, dressed in white clothes that are whiter than snow. He appears out of thin air, and at first, no soldier notices him. But soon, one soldier after another raises their heads and looks at Lu You in the sky.

The commanders of both sides frown at the sight of Lu You, who possesses at least eighth realm battle power. They wonder who he is and why he is above the battlefield. To fly here means one possesses great power, but this place is too special, and even someone more powerful cannot act recklessly.

The Sanctuary Civilization's Lord Commander, Eve, coldly opens his mouth, and his voice travels over the land of divine battle. "Even demigods are not allowed to offend. Why don't you quickly retreat?"

Lu You turns his head to look at Eve and smiles coldly. "What kind of divine warland is this? It's just a place where false gods use blood sacrifices as a way to continue their lingering lives."

Lu You's words spread throughout the entire Battlefield Sanctuary, and the soldiers on both sides hear it clearly. They look at each other in surprise, unsure of what to make of Lu You's words. There are similar legends to what Lu You is saying, but it has not been a mainstream voice, and no one dares to talk about it, much less spread it.

The commanders of both sides are stunned, not expecting a god Powerhouse to dare to be so reckless. They wonder who Lu You is and where he comes from. Is he a part of the Pagan organization, the Cult of the Adversary? But they quickly dismiss this thought, as there's no way they could have acted in such a wild manner.

The Sanctuary Civilization's Lord Commander narrows his eyes and says indifferently, "Where are the heathens from, talking nonsense here? It's ridiculous. Do you think anyone will believe you?"

But when Lu You hears this, he only smiles coldly and says nothing more.

This, he smiled and said, "So what if you believe? So what if you don't believe?" Clearly, this Lord Commander of the Sanctuary Civilization had misunderstood. He thought Luu was there to announce news, but Luu was merely contradicting him. Eve's comment directly silenced the gathering. Eve couldn't read the situation, but the place of the Divine battle, the crucial sacrificial ceremony, couldn't be delayed by this tiny Demagod.

Eve turned to an Eighth Realm Demagod General and spoke, "Jera, go kill him. Lead the way." Upon hearing these words, the Demigod General, without hesitation, moved and rushed into the sky. Both Lord Commander Eve and the other Demigod Generals saw that this heretic didn't possess the Eighth Realm but had strength comparable to it. This must be a genius among geniuses.

However, stopping the Divine war from proceeding would result in the death of even the most talented person, an unforgivable sin. At that moment, the Demigod General named Jared transformed into a fireball, like a meteor, and smashed into Luu. Jared was the master of fire's rules, and his attack seemed capable of burning everything.

Luu calmly observed the Demigod General in front of him. He could sense that this Demigod General wasn't bad and had mastered at least three rule characteristics in the Sanctuary Civilization. This made him a relatively powerful Eighth Realm Powerhouse. If he didn't have enough strength, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sanctuary Civilization wouldn't have let him go to war. Unfortunately, he met Luu, an existence who had mastered five rule characteristics and fused two of them.

In the face of Jara's fierce attack, Luu didn't hesitate for a second and swung his sword, cutting through everything. This was because Luu knew that if he couldn't kill in one blow, the Sanctuary Civilization would send other Eighth Realm Powerhouses to save this unfortunate Demigod General.

In this Divine beheading sword, the rule characteristics of chopping and sharpness were perfectly fused, and the rule characteristic of cutting, though not fused, still exerted some effect. The moment the sword was drawn, the Eighth Realm Demigod realized it was not good, but it was too late. In an instant, he completely vanished from this Heaven and Earth.

This was an extremely easy and casual sword strike. An Eighth Realm Demigod had fallen just like that. A sword that decided victory and defeat, life and death. With the fall of this Eighth Realm Demigod, the vision didn't even appear, and his rule origin was absorbed by Luu's civilization - Flame. The rule characteristic of fire was absorbed, while the rule characteristic remained unknown for the moment.

After the battle ended, a deathly silence fell over the land. This Divine battlefield, filled with millions of soldiers, could be described as eerily quiet. All the soldiers were left with their jaws dropped, unable to believe their eyes. An honorable and powerful Demigod General had died so easily, so casually, like a wild dog on the side of the road. The other Demigod Generals were horrified, and even the Skippers of both sides froze.

Luu held a long sword and looked down on the millions of troops below, gazing at each and every Demigod General. Under the gazes of millions of soldiers, Luu had killed a Demigod Powerhouse with just a single stroke of his sword. Demigods fell, blood rained down. The image was so shocking that it made both the Sanctuary Civilization's army and the Immortal Feather Civilization's army feel goosebumps all over their bodies.

Originally, due to the influence of the Divine Battleground's fury, everyone's eyes were slightly red, and they couldn't wait to go up and kill each other. However, at this moment, as the sword cut through and the blood of the Demigod Powerhouses rained down, the morale of both armies rapidly declined. It felt like being doused with a tub of ice water from the head, instantly calming everyone down.

No one had expected such a variation to occur in today's Divine battle. It was so unexpected that the entire land of the Divine battle fell extraordinarily silent. Only after this did the soldiers react, looking at each other and seeing the fear in each other's eyes. This kind of fear wasn't from Luu alone; suddenly, they all woke up and reacted to their current situation.

They remembered the words Luu had said about the false god taking advantage of this blood sacrifice, the land of divine warfare, and the land of blood sacrifice. The rumors about this place never seemed to stop. The most immediate point was that hardly any ordinary soldiers made it out of here alive. Fear spread quickly, and after Luu's eyes swept over many soldiers, they subconsciously backed up, wanting to take advantage of the chaos to escape from this battlefield. This image gave people the feeling that Luu had shocked the 6 million strong army with his presence.

The Master Commander of the Sanctuary civilization frowned tightly as he stared at Luu in the sky. It was just one sword that decapitated Jera, giving them no chance to even rescue them. Obviously, they had not yet reached the eighth realm, as this kind of battle power was unheard of.
On the other side, the Master Commander of the Immortal Feather civilization, Fan Shing, stared at Luu in disbelief. In his heart, he couldn't help but be thankful that he hadn't sent any demigods over to suppress it, otherwise, in nine cases out of ten, it would end up the same way as that unlucky person across the street.
Suddenly, he thought of the news that not long ago, the Sanctuary civilization had fallen - four demigods in a row. Could it be that had something to do with him? The Sanctuary civilization or the Immortal Feather civilization? In fact, the most top-notch combatants there were just a few. It was difficult to come up with more out of thin air. So even if Luu changed his outfit and spoke the language of the Sanctuary civilization, it would still cause people to wonder if there was a connection between the two.
But that's not the point at the moment. Rather, it's the blood sacrifice ceremony. In the event of an accident, whether it was a true God of the Sanctuary civilization or a true God of the Immortal Feather civilization, he was afraid that they would all be enraged. This thing is not going to end well. So, he must be killed here. The problem is, who's going to do it?
If another demigod was sent out and was still killed by a sword, then the morale would fall completely. When in doubt, Van Shing glanced at the many demigod generals who were leaping into action and immediately rebuked in a cold voice, "Don't act rashly."
When the demigod generals heard this, they furrowed their brows and said, "But the Divine War..."
Van Shing said indifferently, "It's not like we're the only ones whose Godly battles have been affected. The opposite side is as well, and this guy is obviously looking for the Sanctuary civilization to seek revenge. So what does this have to do with us? Let's not go over there and make a scene."
The moment these words came out, the many Demigod generals immediately bowed their heads and stopped speaking. Meanwhile, on the side of the Sanctuary civilization, Lord Commandery's face was as gloomy as water. He saw that the side of the Immortal Feathers civilization seems to have no intention to step in and help, even if their Divine war is also Disturbed.
Hm, what a short-sighted and stupid guy, Eve couldn't help but be annoyed and pondered what to do. He personally wanted to kill this arrogant little guy, but the thing is, since he's so arrogant, he must have some backbone. Must have left some backhanded if even the commander-in-chief made a move and couldn't kill it or even rolled over because of it, it would be a real mess that couldn't end.
Thinking for a split second, Eve looked at a demigod again. "Eugene, go suppress him. Since Jara's death, Eugene, while stunned, could be said to be enraged because Jera was his closest friend. And at this moment, he was actually killed just like that. So naturally, he was angry to the extreme.
At the commanding officer's gesture, Eugene did not hesitate for a moment and rushed straight up into the sky. Pagan Demigod Eugene roared, killing towards Luu. When Luu decapitated a demigod and he still dared to charge over, he naturally had some backbone. Like Luu, he had also mastered the five rule characteristics. There was even a very rare rule origin of Thunder among them.
At this moment, his body was covered in lightning and entangled, and his Zora could be described as extraordinarily terrifying. Looking at the eighth realm Demigod of the entire Sanctuary civilization, Eugene was considered a very powerful existence. At this moment, he rushed to kill, and under the anger, his battle strength even increased, and for a while, he fought with Luu, even vaguely pressing Luu ahead.
Skipper narrowed his eyes slightly at the sight. He was waiting for Luu's backhand. In fact, Eve could not be blamed for being overly concerned. It was really Luu's behavior that was too crazy. It was naturally unreasonable for him to dare to call out in front of the two armies with just this amount of strength and dare to disturb the Divine battle.
Eve would naturally have the preconceived notion that Luu still had a backhand prepared and that the organization behind him could not possibly allow a top genius like him to die.
Trudy above the sky, a sudden change occurred. Originally, the two sides were still fighting each other, but in an instant, Luu had the upper hand. At this moment, the Ganan in his body operated to the extreme, and the set of supreme treasure plus heavy treasure plus secret treasure all over his body increased his strength to the extreme. But even so, he only had the upper hand and it was simply impossible for him to kill this thunder rule origin Powerhouse with a single sword.
As long as he was injured and didn't die under the sword, some other eighth realm Powerhouse would inevitably rush over to rescue him.
Luu clenched his teeth. Sword rode to God in an instant. The power of the sword da rules from the universe, the void, and even the secret realm rapidly filled Luu's body, and his battle power once again came to an unprecedented Peak. Before this sword beheading God was even swung, the Thunder rule controller, Eugene, an eighth

In the realm of Demag Good, he immediately sensed a crisis. He then realized why his best friend had been decapitated with a single sword. Not to mention Jera, even he seemed small and vulnerable under this sword. "Run, run, run!" Without hesitation, Eugene transformed into an electric light and instantly disappeared.

Chapter 243: The Legendary Destiny's Child. It had to be said that this eighth realm Powerhouse was extremely powerful in terms of both strength and reaction speed. Luu only slightly revealed a trace of his terrifying Aura and without hesitation, he immediately fled. "It's still really hard to kill, but this God-slaying sword is not that simple." Luu stared at Eugene, who had transformed into an electric light, and instantly locked onto him. "I'll chop you up, even if I run away, even if you don't die, you'll be half crippled." At this moment, Eugene felt a stimulation akin to an A in his back, and his heart cried out for help. "Help me, help me!" Eugene made a decisive pass, and there was indeed a Demag Good General rushing over to rescue him. There were five Demag Good powerhouses, thinking of saving Eugene from Luu with the help of a joint force. When they had just rushed over, Luu chopped down with the sword, immediately realizing how naive and foolish they had been. "Where can they block it? Even if the Lord Commander came over and blocked it, it wouldn't be a good idea, not to mention us." With Luu's peak strength and the increase in the sword's rules, the beheading of a God fell like a thunderclap. The three Demag Good powerhouses died tragically on the spot, directly going up in smoke without even having the chance to save themselves. The other two Demag Good powerhouses were not doing well either. Although they didn't die, they were severely injured and near death. With just one sword, he nearly killed five Demag Goods. Originally, they might have just been seriously injured. Eugene pulled five unlucky people with the back, and he was unharmed but harmed them. Luu couldn't help but smile at the scene. "There's a windfall. The lightning rule controller who just escaped couldn't be a mole, right? Specializing in pitting teammates one against three, earned it, earned it." Feeling three wisps of rule origin, civilization fire, and Ed, Luu's mood could be described as very good. He then took advantage of the crowd's shock, bursting out of the equipment treasure and ingesting it all, throwing it into the Chinan treasure Pearl. After beheading a Demag Good Powerhouse with a sword just now and being stared at by so many powerhouses, Luu didn't dare to fish for equipment and treasures easily, fearing a sneak attack. Now that he had this sword, which was so terrifying that it scared many strong people into not daring to act rashly, he naturally had a chance to fish for equipment. Despite having withdrawn from the state of Sword Da Tonin and feeling many pains in his flesh and spirit, he did not show fatigue but instead grew more and more excited. Luu scanned the army of the sanctuary civilization, then glanced behind him at the army of the immortal feather civilization. "No sound is better than sound." Even without speaking, just a single look shocked millions of troops in the distance. In the immortal feather civilization, the Lord Commander van Shing, who was watching the show, had a shocked face full of gratitude. The power of this sword was such that even he felt the danger. Luckily, he had told his men not to strike on the other side. Eve's pupils even shrunk slightly. Fong hesitated and then struck out to rescue him. Already slow, even though Eve had mastered the 12 rule characteristics and stepped into the peak of the eighth realm, he was known as the number one demigod under the true gods of the sanctuary civilization, and his strength was incomparably terrifying. But he hadn't made a move in over 300 years, having forgotten what it was like to fight and the courage to go for the kill. The original spiritedness and youthfulness had long since dissipated. In the moment of facing that sword, he actually hesitated, directly leading to the death of three more demigods. If he had stepped in, he would never have allowed Luu to easily kill the three Demag Goods. Clearly, the strength of this little guy across the street was far inferior to his own, yet he had been forward-looking and indecisive at this time. On the site of the sanctuary civilization, many Demag Good generals were anxious. "Lord Commander, please also make a move. Only you can fix him now. I also ask the Lord Commander to make a move to quell this heretic." Eve doesn't he know to strike? Of course, he knows. If he doesn't make a move, it's not going to end well. Gritting his teeth, Eve looked towards van Shing, the commander-in-chief, and the immortal feather civilization army struck together to subdue him. Eve transmitted all the Supreme Treasures on his body, "Belong to me." Brahma Star took advantage of the fire good Eve, who didn't hesitate and agreed straight away, then directly suppressed him. Brahma Star laughed, and struck out. Corly, whom Eve snorted coldly, struck out at the same time. The two PK thrm existences, both mastering at least 10 or more rule characteristics, joined forces to target Luu at this moment, and that overwhelming might directly made Luu unable.

In that instant, a strong sense of crisis made Luu's heart leap and the Soul Seal on his forehead burn hot. He knew this was bad and, without hesitation, the wind God feathered wings behind him immediately lifted, carrying him away.

"Run? After you've played hard to get?"  He stared indifferently in the direction Luu had fled, and without the slightest hesitation, he immediately gave chase. Brahma Star laughed, equally unwilling to lag behind. Whether for Luu's treasure or to give an explanation to the True God, he had to come to his aid.

As the two masters disappeared, countless soldiers looked at each other in dismay. Just now, the two masters, who were supposed to be incompatible, had joined forces. This unexpected alliance completely shattered their morale. All the soldiers, no longer restrained, turned and ran frantically, fleeing this place used for blood sacrifices and divine battles.

Seeing this scene, both demigod generals knew it was bad. Without hesitation, they struck out, instantly killing thousands of soldiers. "Death to those who run! Back to the front line! No running away!" However, the more this happened, the faster these soldiers ran, and the entire Divine Battleground descended into chaos. This blood sacrifice ceremony had been completely disrupted. Brahma naturally saw the scene. The good Divine War blood sacrifice was completely ruined and could no longer continue. The True God would be furious, and the culprit was fleeing frantically not far ahead.

"Kill or capture alive! Just don't let him get away!" Brahma once again reached out to suppress him, but Luu's wind God feathered wings, coupled with the Freedom trait, were not only fast but also unencumbered, easily escaping the suppression. The two peaks of the eighth realm joined forces, but they were unable to catch Luu in a short period of time.

"What speed!" Eve was alarmed. A district of the sixth realm yet possessed this kind of speed and strength. Van Shing was even more alarmed. He had never seen such a terrifying Heavenly Pride before. It reminded Van Shing of some legends from his long history. It was said that every few million or 10 million years, a Destiny's Child appeared. Each generation's Destiny's Child was extremely gifted, whether in their qualifications or cultivation speed. They came with a mission and existed to overthrow the True Gods of the major civilizations. Now, the genius in front of him seemed to be the legendary Son of Destiny.

Here is the revised text:

Them, if he used the "soul-töning" technique, it would be no different from taking his own life; it would be like drinking hemlock to quench his thirst. Even less so, the soul seal, once triggered, marked the end of Luu's adventure and compelled him to return. It would be three years before he could embark on a new adventure. Feeling the burning sensation of the soul seal on his brow, Luu gradually realized that he had played a significant game, but one that had delivered a thrilling experience. The overwhelming pressures from the two Peaks of the 8th Realm came crashing down on his face as he frantically fled, knowing that he could not sustain this pace for much longer. If the reinforcements from the opposing side arrived, there would be no escape. Even attempting to flee back to the 100,000 Mountains to seek help from the powerful figures was no option. Luu eliminated this possibility after a fleeting moment of consideration, for two PK realm existences were no joke, and the issue of casualties would inevitably lead to the resident authorities being discovered. If it was impossible to escape the two realms, the consequences would be dire. 

What to do? Luu's figure swiftly moved while racking his brain to think of various ways to break the game. Feeling the relentless pain in his physical body and the mental exhaustion, Luu couldn't help but feel a sense of desperation. Was there truly no way out? No. There were ways. 

Luu suddenly thought of something and hastened his speed, changing direction just as the hint of the system's Quest flashed on the panel. 

"Quest 2: Explore 1% of the secret realm and bring back Treasures of equal value. Completed Mission Reward: Concentration Pill," it read.

Luu quickly scanned the text on the panel, and sure enough, this journey of exploration would reveal the truth about the Land of the Divine War, and another escape would ensue, allowing his mission progress to break 1%. 

It's still not easy, Luu thought, glancing at the introduction of the item reward: "Concentration Pill (Rank 8, Perfect Type, Consumable): After taking it, you can completely condense your mind and temporarily experience the Great Da of Heaven and Earth. Description: Meditation and concentration; Unity of Heaven and Man. A superb elixir that can be taken even by the ordinary person. However, it's a pity that the time for enlightenment is extremely short, and the person who takes it needs to choose his or her path carefully."

Luu frowned as he looked at the introduction of the item in front of him. The reward was no doubt enticing, but was it worth the risk, considering his current predicament? Luu didn't have a better solution at the moment, so he decided to treat the proverbial horse as a living horse.

After a brief moment of deliberation, Luu made a swift movement and appeared in the distance. He took out the elixir and stuffed it into his mouth.

At the same time, Eve and Brahma Star were both stunned.

"Watch out! He's getting high!" Eve warned.

"No, I'm afraid it's a fight to the death!" Brahma Star replied, a hint of surprise in his voice.

Like a fish out of water, Luu's figure was rapidly changing direction as he fled with increasing speed, his mind racing with the benefits of the concentration pill.

"What's going on?" Eve was perplexed.

"It seems he's not affected by it," Brahma Star said, his confusion evident.

In that moment, Luu didn't explode with newfound power but rather continued to flee as if his life depended on it.

"What do you mean?" Eve asked, puzzled.

"It's as if he didn't go all out at the beginning to use his full potential and spare no effort to subdue him; if that's the case, he would have been caught and subdued a long time ago," Brahma Star explained.

However, that option was not on the table for Luu. Instead, he chose to flee and potentially suffer the consequences later.

The moment Eve and Brahma Star comprehended this, they finally reacted.

"Wait a minute!" Eve exclaimed. "He's sensing the rules!"

Brahma Star's eyes widened in shock.

Yes, indeed. Luu could still experience the thrill of the battle within the realm of rules.

"Since the rules are in effect, isn't it... effective?" Eve asked, her voice still filled with confusion.

After all, Luu's consumption of the concentration pill was still within the realm of the rules. 

"Yes, it seems to be working," Luu exclaimed with a glimpse of satisfaction.

"Ever since Luu consumed the concentration pill, urged by the pressure of the life-and-death crisis, Avenue after Avenue of the rules opened its doors to him. The basic rules of the world, such as wind, fire, earth, and water, as well as special rules like thunder and lightning, sword da, Sun Tien, and life, were all exposed to Luu.

How to choose? The concentration pill's description emphasized that the time for enlightenment was short, and the taker needed to carefully deliberate their path.

Luu, however, had the entire realm of rules at his fingertips. He was both excited and distressed by this sudden development.

With the concentration pill's effects, Luu's world suddenly opened up. He felt a sense of liberation and a newfound understanding of the world and its secrets.

He was afraid that he wouldn't know what to choose, but Luu was different. The old man of the Marshall Saints had explained this to him when he was teaching the rules themselves. Although the rules were not high or low in terms of importance, there were high and low levels of those who mastered the rules, as well as the battle power after mastering them. The five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth became a class of basic rules that could exhibit a combat power that was usually not considered impressive due to the characteristics of their rules. They were usually quite general, and unless one could fuse these rules, it was possible to explode into something more powerful. However, the path of fusing rules was just too difficult, in addition to the ground rules that could bring chaos and so on. These kinds of special rules displayed a battle power that was much more powerful than the basic rules. This was the root of those powerful communities. Luu's Master, Jaan Yuan, had a sword rule that was likewise a rule type with outstanding battle power, even relative to the tyen son chaos and the like. It was even better because the way of the sword itself, which existed for the purpose of killing, was equivalent to a path of killing. Luu then asked his old dad if there were any more powerful rules on top of these basic and special rules. Face this greed problem, Lu Chang xang did not reprimand, but nodded and replied, of course, I have on top of these basic rules. There are even more special rules. There are a total of three rules that transcend the many rules. One for time, two for space, three for Destiny. When one stepped into these three rule avenues, even if it was just some fur, the battle power they displayed was clearly more powerful than the other rules. Time, space, and Destiny. I want to see these three rule avenues. This thought flashed through Luu's mind. He then saw on top of the basic rules, the special rules, the Avenues of rules, the rule origin of time, the rule origin of space, and the rule origin of Destiny, when these three vast paths appeared in front of him. Luu couldn't help but be a little surprised that he was really allowed to choose. It's slow to describe, but in actuality, it's just an instant of lightning. Even Brahma star realized that Luu had to attend to the rules while escaping, and they were shocked and immediately attacked in the face of these three High origin rules. Luu did not hesitate for a second and directly chose space. For the reason that there's no reason, so Luu chose space instead. It's better to say that space chose Luu with just that moment of Enlightenment. Luu felt an unprecedented Avenue of rules compared to the basic rules, the special rules. This spatial Avenue was how vast and unfathomable it was at the same time. Luu had some realization as to why he had chosen space, or rather why space had chosen him. The reason is simple: Talent. His natural aptitude for wind, God feathered wings, the essence of which was to be unrestrained in Roman space, as well as the freedom and cutting of the rules of the wind were likewise related to the rules of space. The chop of the sword, da rule, in essence also had some connection with space. It was for these reasons that the Space rule origin had chosen him. If forced to participate in the two Avenues of time and fate, Luu was difficult to gain. Now that feeling is what it feels like. Brush the wind God feathered wings of Luu behind his back snapped instantly, pulling away. Boom! Even Brahma's attacks fell flat on their faces. The terrifying attack of the two produced a violent explosion in midair like two meteors colliding. The aftermath alone set off a hurricane on the ground, destroying a house and uprooting a tree. However, Luu, who was roaming in space, was not affected at all. Since Luu realized the power of the y Space rule origin, his speed became even more terrifying. He dodged with ease, having been very close to the instantaneous transfer, both Eve and Van Shing were both Peak eth realm existences, so they naturally saw the power of Luu's move. Eve stared wide-eyed, full of disbelief. This is the Spatial rules. Brahma star's face was wonderful. I can now confirm 100% that he is definitely the son of Destiny, born in response to fate. What now? Eve transmits, keep chasing Brahma Singh. Gritted his teeth, wait a little longer, your boss should be coming over. Good Eve nodded and without hesitation immediately struck. Lu glanced at these two peaks of the eighth realm after comprehending the space rule origin. The choice of whether to fight or leave was in Luu's hands. It was just a Pity that the moment of Enlightenment was too short. Even though Luu possessed some talent in the area of space rules, he still hadn't grasped the characteristics of the rules of space. If he succeeded in mastering the characteristics of the rules of space, then it was a real step to Heaven. Although it was really a bit of a Pity, Luu had not been greedy and had already stepped onto the Space rule Avenue. Anyway, as long as he continued on his path, he would surely be able to grasp the characteristics of the rules of space, it's just a matter of time. Luu dodged once again, easily dodging the Joint attack of two peak eighth realm Peaks. He raised his hand and SWORD

This sword, not the all-out strike of Jinshin, was a return to ruins, yet in terms of power, it was not inferior to the previous Divine Beheading Sword that had slain numerous beings of the eight Realms with a single stroke. Whether it was Eve or Brahma Star, they all knew how powerful Luu was, and immediately did their best to join forces to resist. For an existence of their level, it would be a joke to dodge an attack, even if they moved faster. At this realm, even the most random attacks had a sure hit effect, similar to that of a domain. This was also the reason why the previous Demigod Generals of the Sanctuary civilization, who went to war, would pull a few Demigod Generals to back them up. Even with quicker reflexes, it's impossible to run away completely. Not everyone was like Luu, able to navigate through space and dodge attacks with ease.

Chapter 246: The True God has Descended
The sword returned to ruin, and it was still the Chapo plus sharp Fusion rule that was the main focus, with the cut rule as a supplement. It seemed that there was no difference from before, but since Luu had realized the Ye space rule origin, whether it was chop or cut, there was a completely new understanding. Using it again at this moment could be considered completely different. Originally, this sword was not much of a threat to the peak of the eighth realm, but now, after the sword had vaguely invoked the rules of space, the essence had changed, and the power was naturally incomparable. Even Brahma Star could be considered a great enemy and did not hesitate to join forces to resist.

Thumbs down, layers and layers of rules defense, like balloons, were easily poked and sliced through without the slightest pause. The attack of the higher rules, in the face of these ordinary rule defenses, was like a descending blow. After the many rule defenses, all of which were swiftly sliced through, and after seeing that they were about to hit the main body, the power of this sword finally ran out. His, even Vanessa, sucked in a breath of cold air, although he was not injured, his face was extraordinarily pale, and his body was covered in cold sweat. They were intimidated. This sword of Luu was simply too terrifying. If a single peak of the eighth realm were to face the sword alone, even if they didn't die, they would be injured.

For Ely, they reacted quickly and directly joined forces to defend. Is this the legendary Destiny's Child during the sixth realm, one could threaten the peak of the eighth realm in this instant? Even Brahma Star's battle spirit was gone, compared to giving an account to the true God, they were more afraid of death. The two of them, one of them hadn't fought in 300 years, and the other who hadn't fought in over 200 years, had long forgotten what it was like to fight. They just wanted to rely on the huge realm Gap and Bully Luu when Luu had the strength to threaten them, how could he be willing to continue fighting? Run without the slightest hesitation, both Eve and Brahma Star chose to escape.

Meanwhile, in the city below, there was a seventh Rome City Lord who didn't dare to utter a single breath as he shielded his own Aura and carefully watched the battle in the sky above. His eyes filled with panic. "It's horrible, those are two Pate realm existences. Ah, actually cannot help that teenager." The seventh realm City Lord's eyes widened. The offense and defense have reversed. This teenager it seems that he doesn't intend to let go of those two peaks of the eighth realm. After seeing even Brahma Star as Escape, Luu didn't think much and directly chased after them. Being chased all the way like a wild dog being whisked around, it almost inspired the final card Soul seal. It's absolutely impossible not to get back with a vengeance after such a mess.

Obviously, even if even Van Shing's speed was faster, it was impossible to match that of Luu who had comprehended the origin of the space rule. Even though he hadn't grasped the characteristics of the he space rules, the gains from comprehending the origin of the he space rules were still quite a lot at this moment. Luu, waving his wind God feathered wings, was swimming in space as freely and naturally as a fish swimming in water. You can't kill me, even Vanessa were in a hurry and spoke almost in unison. "Why?" Luu asked with some curiosity. "We are willing to serve you, the son of Destiny," they transmitted their voices almost without thinking. Luu was slightly stunned when he heard this and asked with some curiosity, "What is a Destiny's Child in a life and death situation?" Even Brahma Star naturally didn't hesitate and immediately explained after hearing the legend. Luu nodded. It seemed that he had been misunderstood by these two old guys. Seeing that Luu seem to have hesitated, even Brahma Star once again transmitted their voices, "We are at least at the peak of the eighth realm in our respective civilizations. We are even more powerful with our help. Your overthrow of the false gods will go more smoothly." Hearing these words, Luu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow as he smiled and said, "There is some truth in what you guys are saying."

Even Brahma breathed a sigh of relief, and the heart was even more grateful. I must say, this little guy is still too young; how can you be so easily fooled? He is strong, but he is just too simple. However, at this very moment, Luu was swinging his sword, just one sword, directly cutting off half of Eve's body. This injury could be considered very serious for an ordinary eighth realm, but Forev, who was at the peak of the eighth realm and had mastered the twelve rule characteristics, recovered as before in just a breath. However, his even paler face showed that it was not without a price.

"Why are you trying to kill me?" Eve roared, exasperated. "We were willing to help you."

"It's your business if you are willing to help me, and it's my business if I want to kill you," Luu said, somewhat strangely.

At these words, Eve was dumbfounded. The Brahma star on the side saw the situation and immediately abandoned him. He didn't need to be faster than Luu, just outrun Eve. Eve instantly felt some despair. Before he could speak, Luu swung his sword again, chopping that incomparable horror of a sword that distorted the space around him. There was nowhere to hide, no place to escape under this sword. It was as if space was going to be shredded. Layer upon layer of rule defense shattered, unable to resist them in the slightest. Eve was shredded again, and despite quickly recovering as before, he couldn't stop spitting out blood. His injuries were obviously worse.

Eve gritted his teeth and seemed to have utilized some sort of secret technique to recover his state, then turned around and ran. Luu dodged and instantly caught up.

"Don't you force me, Eve," Luu said, furious. "Why didn't you think this would happen when you were chasing me before?"

Without the slightest hesitation, Luu swung his sword and chopped again. Unfortunately, Eve quickly recovered again. It was like an undefeatable little strong man recovering over and over again, but his aura, which had obviously decayed a lot, proved that he couldn't recover indefinitely.

"Your rule characteristics are pretty good," Luu's eyes lit up as he opened his mouth to praise Eve.

Eve's scalp tingled. He didn't want to hear that. On the ground, holding his breath, the Seven Realms City Lord saw this scene and also had a burst of heartbeat. His body could not stop trembling. A peak eighth realm Demag God was going to be killed. However, right at this moment, an extremely powerful and terrifying aura suddenly descended. Feeling this aura, the Seven Realms City Lord's heart jerked violently.

"True God, the true God has come down," he thought.

Chapter 247: Facing a True God, Slaying the Peak of the Eighth Realm. Eve almost felt like he was going to die, but he didn't realize that at the end of the mountain, his savior had finally arrived. Feeling the terrifying aura of a true God descending, Eve was ecstatic and hurriedly cried out.

"This guy is the son of Destiny Lord," he said.

Luu couldn't help but furrow his brows when he felt this evil aura that was so dense to the extreme. He hadn't really expected that at the last minute, when he was about to behead a peak of the eighth realm, the evil God of the sanctuary civilization had appeared. On second thought, though, it seemed normal. He was in the land of the Divine War, disturbing the blood sacrifice ceremony and preventing the sanctuary civilization and the immortal feather civilization, two major civilizations of evil Gods, from feeding. Then it was even more of a big mess, chasing it all the way, almost lifting the entire sanctuary civilization with such a big movement. It will naturally attract countless attention.

At the beginning, there was almost no suspense in victory or defeat. Luu had no way to resist the two peaks of the eighth realm, so there was no need for the true God to show up. But now, with the reversal of the offense and defense, Luu was about to kill a peak of the eighth realm, and it was only natural for this old man to make an appearance.

Above the sky, dark clouds converged, and a terrifying figure gradually appeared. A pair of cold eyes slowly gazed at Luu. Both ears buzzed as if the scene of Hell slowly unfolded in front of his eyes. An incomparably terrifying spiritual attack directly pulled Luu into this infernal hell. Within Luu's body, the Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul suppressor Stone was spinning crazily as a precious treasure generated by the chi of the Heavenly Dipper. In the beginning, it had an incomparably powerful utility in suppressing the soul, effectively protecting the wearer's Divine soul and Sea Of Consciousness from the threat of psychic-based attacks. However, this Heaven and Earth Wonder was only of the eighth rank, and logically speaking, it could not protect against the attacks of a ninth rank existence at all. But this ninth realm evil God, who had long been on the path of degeneration, was not considered tough as far as strength was concerned. So this Tao Heavenly Dipper Soul suppressor Stone was considered to be barely a protection against this wave of spiritual attacks.

Luu quickly regained his clarity. Yet, it was this one moment of trance that revealed the gap. After seeing the true God use a spiritual attack, the peak eighth realm Eve didn't hesitate in the slightest and directly struck out.

Attacking the attack of the five attributes seemed like a massive millstone, relentlessly smashing toward Luu. When Luu's eyes regained their clarity, the attack had already hit him. Luu's body was directly smashed away, and his tough defense, representing the rule of gold, instantly shattered. Luu had unintentionally absorbed this attack, the peak of the eighth realm's battle power. This was not a soft pimon to be wielded at will. At this moment, this move, shattering Ru's defense and penetrating the Supreme Treasures' protection, injured Luu. He couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood. Blood seeped out of his skin, and Luu, like a meteorite, directly smashed into the ground, creating a large pit and raising smoke and dust in the sky.

Eve took advantage of the situation and carried the huge five elements grinding wheel, killing again. Die, Eve, roared as if venting his anger and as if expressing his loyalty to the true God. Behold, I have slain the Destiny's Child for you. Above the sky, the true God named Yes, indifferently watched the scene and did not speak.

In the deep pit, Luu's injuries were not considered serious. The rule protection and Supreme Treasures protection mitigated the power of the strike, and Luu's strong physical defense allowed him to only suffer some light injuries, even less than the damage that the sword Dow rules had inflicted on himself. However, at this moment, Eve, unaware of this, thought that Luu was seriously injured and about to die. So, he decisively rode on his victory.

The moment Eve threw out the five elements grinder in his hand, Luu also swung out the long sword in his hand, Paul Chopper. Under the powerful pressure of the ninth realm evil God, Luu's comprehension of the y space rules seemed to have deepened. At this moment, in this sword beheading God beheading sharpness and cutting, these three rule characteristics vaguely showed signs of fusing with each other. Compared to the previous few swords, which could only injure Eve but not kill him, this sword was fundamentally different.

Eve, who was chasing after him, completely did not expect that Luu would be able to remain conscious under a true God's spiritual attack and still have the ability to fight back under his own full force. This was incredible. Was this the Destiny's Child, helping me, Lord Yes, help me? Without the slightest thought of resisting, Eve turned to flee and asked the true God for help.

The distance was simply too close, and the move was so ferocious that even a true God would be too late to come to the rescue. A sword zanin swung out as if Heaven and Earth were upside down, and the three kinds of rule special effects bloomed with extremely terrifying might. Even the peak of the eighth realm was unable to resist it in the slightest. Eve was directly engulfed by the sword light, chop chop chop chop chop chop chop chop chop. Amidst the roiling sword light, Eve, who had been able to recover over and over again, was completely strangled.

At this moment, Eve, a peak of the eighth realm, had fallen just like that. Rumble, this time the vision was even more terrifying. The heavens and earth were dim, the Sun and Moon had no light, and blood rained down from the sky with a huge range, covering almost the entire Divine ruined continent. The fall of a peak of the eighth realm was a major event that hadn't happened on the Divine ruined continent for a long, long time.

Brahma star, who was fleeing, constantly trembled in his body. He knew that that guy, Eve, had died and felt empathetic. His mood was extraordinarily sad. At the same time, Immortal feather civilization and ancient Market civilization, two powerful true Gods, raised their heads at the same time and looked at the sky in surprise. What's the situation? Why would a peak of the eighth realm suddenly fall in the Divine Battleground?

A Demon God General felt this Heaven and Earth anomaly and an unpleasant premonition arose in his heart. Meanwhile, a billion mountains deep many martial artists were a bit surprised when they felt the vision in the sky. A falling vision of this scope would only be produced if the peak of the eighth realm died.

Legion Commander Shha was somewhat surprised. Could this be related to the little Marshall Saint Chow Sha? He furrowed his brows and guessed so. Impossible. How could a junior Marshall Saint kill such a powerful existence? Shha subconsciously shook his head when he heard this. Although the junior Marshall Saint is powerful, it's still too difficult to kill a peak of the eighth realm.

Chia Sha did not refute but looked up at the sky in concern. After such a big thing happened, he could not help but feel a little worried about the situation of the little Marshall Saint now. It was then that the vision, which was enormous in scope, faded away. The situation was akin to that on the battlefield of The Outpost not so long ago. Shha and Shia Sha immediately reacted. Does this mean that today, Luu will behead the gods?

At first, Legion Commander Shha didn't feel that it had anything to do with the little Marshall Saint. The reason is simple. This was the vision of a peak of the eighth realm falling. Even if a junior Marshall Saint was more powerful, it would be difficult for him to make such progress in a short period. At the peak of the eighth realm, he had mastered at least 10 or more rule characteristics.

Amidst his extraordinary strength, if such an existence appeared on The Outpost's battlefield, it would almost lead to extinction. Even Sherow, using the Bloodb Burning Secret Method, couldn't resist it. The power of an eighth realm peak being was truly terrifying. However, the truth was unexpected. Chia Sha guessed that the situation was related to the Little Marshall Saint. Both Xia Sha and Shao couldn't help but stare, frozen for a moment. Upon regaining their composure, they exchanged shocked glances.

Shao couldn't help but ask Xia Sha, who had previously helped Little Marshall Saint, if he knew anything. Xia Sha admitted he didn't, as he had only assisted the Little Marshall Saint once before. This time, however, he feared that the Little Marshall Saint had gone too far, possibly angering the ninth realm True God of the Sanctuary Civilization.

If Little Marshall Saint had indeed beheaded an eighth realm peak figure, causing such a commotion, the ninth realm True God would likely descend in person. The mere mention of this caused Shao's eyes to widen in disbelief. Xia Sha then looked up at the sky, softly stating his hope that his guess was wrong.

In Luuunk's body, the Flame of Civilization rapidly absorbed a strand of Rule Origin. After a while, the vision gradually disappeared. It was evident that when the eighth realm peak figure died, there was still significant backlash. The Fire of Civilization took a long time to finish absorbing it.

Above the sky, the nine Realms' True Gods of the Sanctuary Civilization immediately sensed these changes. They realized that the Rule Essence that escaped was absorbed by Luu, who was devouring rules. This tactic was unheard of and unprecedented. The True God narrowed his eyes, a hint of caution flashing across his complexion.

He observed Luu, covered in blood, and quickly made an accurate judgment of his battle strength. Luu was above the eighth realm and below the ninth, which was horrifying. If allowed to grow further, he would inevitably become a legendary godslayer in the future. This would pose a threat to the True God, the Immortal Feather Civilization, and the True Gods of the Ancient Ruined Civilization.

Fortunately, Luu's recklessness and haste exposed him too early. Yas couldn't help but feel a bit thankful. However, facing the legendary son of Destiny capable of creating countless miracles, Yas remained cautious. Although Luu had recently killed an eighth realm peak figure and several eighth realm demigods, Yas wasn't the slightest bit annoyed. Instead, he felt they deserved their fate. Finding the Destiny's Child ahead of time could be a great achievement.

Yas then commanded the Kingdom of God to descend. A complete world, unlike the realm, was constructed and descended into this side of the world. This world consisted of small worlds with rules entirely made up of Yas's Earth, fire, wind, and water, as well as the cycle of life and death, from the first chaos to the birth of the world, from disorder to order, and from birth to destruction. This side of the world was incredibly solid, and even with Luu's wind God feathered wings and the freedom of Ye, he still felt heavy constraints.

As the Divine Kingdom descended, Yas's expression gradually became calm and self-assured. He stared at Luu and slowly stated that a ninth realm True God possesses absolute suppression over an eighth realm Demigod, and this suppression originates from the Divine Kingdom. In this complete world, Yas was the only God. Since Luu had entered his world, there was only one way out: death. Yas reminded Luu that he exposed his existence too early and should have grown silently. However, there was no such result, and the God declared that Luu could die with this understatement.

Yas extended his finger and pointed at Luu. Luu felt like his heart was being grabbed and squeezed tightly, causing intense pain and making his eyes whiten. He barely stood still, using the Revival of the wind God's feathered wings to quickly retreat a distance. Xia Sha furrowed his brows, feeling tricky. The further Luu retreated, the wider the gap and Realm disparity became. A Dharma phase facing a Dharma body would be absolutely crushing, and domains held an absolute advantage against Phantoms. Rules, however, faced fields and were at a complete disadvantage. The rules were perfect and constituted complete worlds, making them incomparable to ordinary rules. Entering the ninth realm for the first time was still not comparable to the peak of the eighth realm.

There were also some peaks of the Eighth Realm that could reverse the Nine Realms, but that was without a doubt a very rare existence, at least at this moment. Luu clearly did not possess such conditions to reach such heights. When Y asked, he glanced at Luu, and a hint of surprise swept through his cold eyes.
"What a strong physical body. With this move of mine, even the peak of the Eighth Realm would have their hearts crushed in one go, but him, he actually didn't even get injured. Outrageous! This kind of physical strength completely surpassed Yasu's imagination. This couldn't help but make him a bit skeptical. Were the sons of Destiny of all generations so fierce in their existence? According to those historical documents, I'm afraid there isn't a single Destiny's Child that can reach this level."
Right when the blow failed, Yasu didn't stop. He raised his hand again and spoke faintly, "God said, 'Let there be light.'" In an instant, the hot white light came from all over the sky, irradiating every inch of the Divine Kingdom. Luu had nowhere to escape, nowhere to hide. He had to be passive and Invincible.
The purest and strongest of the sun's true flame almost set his body on fire. Luu wrapped himself in Wind God feather Wings, even then, it was just barely blocked. Seeing that, Yasu couldn't help but frown. He continued to speak, and God said, "Let there be wind," and God said, "Let there be fire," and God said, "Let there be water."
God said before the words were finished. Luu, who was constantly enduring attacks, finally adapted to the rhythm of the opposite sides' attacks and found an opportunity. He stared viciously at the true God in madir and, without the slightest hesitation, he directly swung out the long sword in his hand.
"Today, behead the gods!"
This was a sword full of endless anger. Before this, Luu had never suffered such a big loss. Even when he was defeated by the peak of the Eighth Realm, he was only whisked away to escape. Everywhere, not like now, being pressed and beaten, not even having a chance to escape. What had to be admitted was that the Ninth Realm was indeed very strong. The stable composition of the world was completely incomparable to the realm. Luu was unable to escape from this world, even with the manipulation of the Wind God's feathered wings and the freeing properties of the rule of wind.
The Nine Realms and the Eight Realms, although there was only a difference of one realm, it was a completely different level, which could be described as the difference between clouds and mud. What's more, Luu was only in the Sixth Realm. It's normal to be crushed. It was as if before this, Luu, who only had the Fifth Realm, was unable to defeat the Eighth Realm. The same reasoning applied. The gap between the realms was too great.
The only thing worth celebrating was that the Ninth Realm true God's attacking means were actually not too strong. They couldn't be compared to a true Ninth Realm. He had taken the path of an evil God and, in order to prolong his life, he had gradually lost his original strength by living on through constant blood sacrifices. To put it bluntly, it was a watery Ninth Realm. If not for Lou, Luu would have been unable to withstand his wave after wave of attacks, even with the Supreme treasure defense equipment and even if he had taken the path of Flesh sainthood and had a strong physical body defense. He would not have been able to resist. I'm afraid the soul seal has been triggered a long time ago.
Of course, a watery Ninth Realm is still Nine Realms. This was completely different from the eth realm, especially since the rules constituted a complete world. It was an all-around restraint, which gave Luu a great deal of pressure. However, Luu was an extremely terrifying existence in terms of both his ability to adapt and his rate of progress. Under this unprecedented pressure, at this critical juncture of life and death, Luu's strength broke through once again.
At this moment, a sword chopped out, exploding with unprecedented might. The space of the small world was completely distorted. The fusion of the three rule characteristics had been initially fused at this moment. The fusion of the three rule characteristics coupled with comprehending the true meaning of the espace rule origin. The power of this sword to behead the gods directly reached an unprecedented Peak.
Feeling the terrifying power of this sword, Yasu knew that it was not good and just wanted to dodge and withdraw. But he was still half a step too slow, and half of his body was instantly churned into countless fragments. Dead? Apparently not, in this small world. He is the true God, and there is no death in the true sense of the word, unless Luu could completely blow up this side of the small world. Only then could he threaten the life of this Ninth Realm existence. Otherwise, trying to kill a Ninth Realm existence was just too hard and too difficult.
At this moment, this sword chopped out, and the space directly in front of him was sliced through. The fusion of the three rule characteristics coupled with the true meaning of the spatial rule essence. This sword successfully opened the world channel. Seeing this, Luu did not hesitate and, with a flick of his wings, he instantly disappeared. At the same time, the body of the true God, Yasu, was sliced into pieces.

Rapidly, he recovered, but it was about to be restored as before. In the blink of an eye, he looked at Luu with some annoyance, but it was just a slight carelessness that had shattered his body. Upon seeing Luu slicing through space and about to leave his sight of the Divine Kingdom, Yas narrowed his eyes and directly reached out to grab him. "Don't even think about escaping."

Luu's back went cold, a coolness spreading all over his body, and his scalp felt as if it had exploded. Luu knew that this was mostly his last chance to escape. If he did it again, this ninth realm true God would definitely not give him a second chance to hit him with a huge realm gap. Any chance to return fire was fleeting and extremely precious. Just because Luu managed to seize an opportunity did not mean he could seize a second one. He knew that this ninth realm true God would inevitably be more cautious and go all out.

Liu continuously waved the wind God feathered wings behind him, and the freedom trait in the true meaning of the y space rule could be considered perfectly fused. Luu's speed surged, and he managed to escape before the spatial crack disappeared. "Success! Finally escaped from the world. This is like a fish entering the sea and a bird going up to the sky, no longer bound by a cage or net." Luu was ecstatic. He didn't have the slightest hesitation and frantically waved his wind God feathered wings. The white Jade wind in fire will under his feet rotated crazily, already emitting sparks and starting to spit fire. No longer bound by the world, Luu's speed was incredible. "F Shu Shu, it just disappeared in the blink of an eye."

When the Divine Kingdom withdrew and the true God Yes walked out of the Divine Kingdom, his face could be described as extremely ugly. "Escape! I'll see where you can escape to." Yas immediately followed the traces in space and directly chased after them. Below the Seven Realm City, the City Lord raised his head and looked at the disappearing true God, his eyes filled with dismay and shock. The true God descended and didn't even manage to kill that guy, Gez. "Who the hell is he?" At the same time, this city of the sanctuary civilization was almost in shambles and wailing. However, some of these powerful people couldn't help but cross their fingers and talk. "It seems like just now the true God has descended. What? Why did the true God descend? It seems to be in pursuit of the teenager. Yes, I saw it too. There was also a vision of a demigod falling just now. A demigod existence has fallen. What the hell happened?"

Shen civilization, Luu escaped in one breath. But when he looked back and felt the hidden fluctuations in the space, he was somewhat speechless. All had fled to this side, actually still chasing, still not letting him go. There was no mistake. Luu was a bit tired and pulled out a bunch of extreme supplements from the chinin treasure pearl. He opened his mouth and ate them quickly, recovering his physical strength and then continuing to accelerate and disappearing once again.

When the true God Yes descended upon the cenu civilization, the Immortal Feather civilization's group of demigods and divine ambassadors could be said to be extraordinarily frightened. "What do you mean a true God of the sanctuary civilization has actually come to the territory of our Immortal Feather civilization? Is this an attempt to start a war, a Godly War like never before? Even the true gods of the Immortal Feather civilization were startled. 'What is your intention, L Mang?' The true God of the Immortal Feather civilization stopped and stared at him with a kind gaze. 'Why did you come to my Immortal Feather civilization? Do you want to break the true God contract? No, Yes, who had been delayed for a while by Ramon, became a bit anxious. 'Hurry up and get out of the way. Can't you see that I'm chasing a little guy? Don't stop me. Who are you after?' Ramon was a little curious. Destiny's Child Yes quickly explained. 'A child of Destiny who in the sixth realm was able to decimate the peak of the eighth realm. A child of Destiny who was able to tear open your Divine Kingdom and escape from it.'

Chapter 250: The Hunt of the 39th Realm True Gods. Raymond was shocked to hear this explanation and was a bit incredulous. "The sixth realm can decapitate the peak of the eighth realm and still tear apart your Divine Kingdom and escape from it. You're not kidding. How could there be such a genius in this world? Not even a child of Destiny. This is completely beyond Ramon's knowledge. So, subconsciously, he thought Yes is lying. You think I'm in the mood for jokes." Yas was angry and anxious, "Get the hell out of here." Sensing Yes's impatience, Ramon knew he wasn't lying and was afraid that the party's words were true. Although Lay Mang was surprised, he quickly accepted this fact and his eyes became grave. "I'll join you in the hunt, Yes." Yas agreed without a second thought. Seeing Yas agree, Ramon's heart sank. In this world, there really is such a horrible genius. If they wait for him to grow up, the consequences are unimaginable. Ramon's scalp tingled a bit. Communication between true gods was extremely rapid. It was slow to describe, but the clash of divine thoughts was but a breath or two before the conversation was

Ramon and Yason reached an agreement. Chase kept on chasing. Feeling the two true Gods join forces, the crowd of Demag goods were directly dumbfounded, each with wide eyes and jaws on the ground in shock. "Jesus, what's going on here?" the true God of the Sanctuary civilization and the true God of our Immortal Feather civilization have actually joined forces. Who are they? It seems whoever it is must be incredibly important that it could make two true Gods chase after it. It's just... incredible.

After Luu appeared over the ancient ruins of civilization, ordinary supplements were no longer useful. He took out the rule crystals and quickly absorbed the power of the rule origin. This flight traversed almost the entire Divine Ruin continent, from the Sanctuary civilization to the Immortal Feather civilization, and then to the Ancient Market civilization. As a result, the pursuers behind him, instead of decreasing, added another one. "It's killing me, it's killing me!" This ninth realm powerhouse was so difficult to deal with. Originally, Luu felt that when he left the world of the Nine Realms with his speed, he would be able to get rid of him in no time. Yet, he was still thinking too simply. The strength of the ninth realm was much more than that. Their sense of rules had already reached a certain realm. The traces that Luu swiftly swept through the air were impossible to detect for the eighth realm, but for the naked eyes of a ninth realm powerhouse, they were so clearly visible. Even if Luu was as fast as he was, he simply couldn't shake off the pursuers behind him. The ninth realm was just too difficult.

Luu once again felt tricky. He gritted his teeth and continued to fly. Soon, when the true God of the Sanctuary civilization and the Immortal Feather civilizations, Ramon and Yason, joined forces and arrived, the ancient ruined civilization's eighth realm Demag goods and seventh realm Divine ambassadors were all directly terrified. "What the hell is going on?" Two true Gods descending on the Ancient Market! However, something even more unexpected happened to them. When the ancient ruined civilization's true God, Matthew, flew above the sky and blocked in front of the two true Gods, it was just a simple exchange of words, and the three true Gods seemed to have reached an agreement before they flew away together, one by one. The eighth realm demigods looked above the sky in shock. "The words were spoken with some trembling accent. The true Gods of the three major civilizations have actually joined forces. That's a first! What the hell happened? Who are they after? Just who is it that can make the three great true Gods join forces to hunt them down? This is just incredible. Nothing like this has ever happened before."

The pursuit of the three true Gods from the Nine Realms there was no doubt that Luu's pressure had multiplied. With a ninth realm chasing him, Luu could easily walk his dog. With two ninth realms chasing and surrounding him, Luu was in a sorry state. With the pursuit of the three ninth realms, it would be very, very difficult for Luu to escape as easily as before, and he was almost pushed to the brink of extinction. A pinch of numbness there's no mistaking it. Are you going to play or not? It was even if one or two ninth realms were chasing after him, but on the Divine Ruins continent, there were only three ninth realms in total, and they all actually came to chase after him. Luu was numb. He kind of wanted to explode. He wanted to use the soul seal to make Pops split out and let these three ninth realm false gods see what it meant to be a true true God Realm Powerhouse. Let them know what kind of existence they had provoked. In fact, at this kind of critical moment, to use the soul seal, it's not really a loss. Killing the three ninth realms for the development of the Divine Ruins continent to clear all the obstacles, it's not really a problem. However, Luu had a headache when he thought that once he used the soul seal, there would be no way to continue the adventure for three years afterward. Is there any other way? Luu gritted his teeth. The wind Gods feathered wings on his back snapped, moving a bit faster. With this flight, Luu's sense of the Y space rule origin had obviously grown a lot. It has to be said that under intense pressure, the potential will always be constantly stimulated, and the speed of growth too will be much faster than normal. If it was normal cultivation, Luu would definitely not be able to progress at such a fast rate. No wonder Papa Marshall Sage didn't object to his adventures. If you want to grow up quickly and become a truly strong person, you have to risk life and death again and again.

The moment Luu once again returned to the Sanctuary civilization and he made a big circle and came back here at the same time, the Demag goods and divine messengers of the Sanctuary civilization, one by one, they were all stunned. Three great true Gods joining forces to hunt them down. Who exactly is blessed with this off-the-charts power? It's outrageous! This is the first time ever. In the meantime, Billion Big Mountains, Sha, and Chia Sha, after learning that a peak of the eighth realm had fallen and that something big had happened in the outside world, immediately sent out scouts to carefully explore the news in the outside world. This is not explored yet, once explored directly shocked the true Gods of the three major civilizations actually joined forces, seemingly to hunt down and kill whoever. Who is he really after?

Here is a rewritten version of the text while maintaining the original meaning:

It was undoubtedly the question on every powerful person's mind: what was behind this news? Many demigods had their own speculations about it, as one would expect. But when Chia Sha and his own ranks heard the news, they first froze momentarily before immediately reacting. "Who is he?" the question was almost instinctual - nine times out of ten, it was obvious that the little Marshall Saint was the one being sought after. Shha was stunned, his jaw hanging open in shock, as he tried to comprehend what little Marshall Saint might have done to incite the 39th realm's true Gods into joining forces against him. It was an exaggeration to say the least. When Chia Sha heard the news, he was shocked but also anxious, thinking to himself, "No way, we can't just sit back and wait for death to come to us." Shha shook his head, "Calm down, the peak of the eighth realm is something we cannot handle, let alone the 39th realm's true Gods. I'm afraid even if all of us were to go over there, we wouldn't be enough to hold our own against them." Chia Sha gritted his teeth, then turned to consider what needed to be done and decided to go back and seek help, responding with a message, "Something must be done."
