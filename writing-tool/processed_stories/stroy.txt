My mother is a Grandmaster at the seventh realm, and my father is the only Marshal Saint at the 10th realm in the world. However, I am a waste with extremely poor aptitude at this moment, lying in my swaddling clothes, trying hard to recall everything that happened. It turns out that before my death, I unexpectedly activated the reversal life system and transmigrated back to when I was 2 years old. Before I could think too much, the system issued a task: try to make Father Lu Chang-Ching show a hint of a smile. The task reward is a Dao embryo pill, which can transform one's body into bones. I reluctantly stood up, and my mother, Yuyu, noticed my movement. She felt both surprised and delighted, saying, "Shao-lu, you are you awake? Do you feel better?" She quickly touched my forehead, took my temperature, and breathed a sigh of relief when everything was normal.

I raised my head and glanced at Bayu-Ya, who was smiling and trying to reassure me that I was fine. "All right, my dear," she said. "I'm finally better, and you're going to be fine too." She picked me up in her arms, and I couldn't help but babble, unable to say anything. At that moment, a loud noise came from outside, followed by a group of people. The middle-aged man leading them had a heroic appearance with a thick beard, followed by a group of doctors. They approached and examined me with various instruments, quickly confirming that I was indeed healed.

The middle-aged man let out a sigh of relief and then started chatting with Bayu-Ya. "It seems like Shao-lu, you can understand me now and even speak," he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. "He's not just a burnt fool anymore; he's become clever, isn't he? Is this really happening?" Shao-lu looked at the gentle expression on Bayu-Ya's face and then at the expectant look on the middle-aged man's face. He hesitated for a moment and finally called out, "Dad!"

Upon hearing this, Lu-Ching's eyes widened instantly, and he was overjoyed, unable to contain his happiness. He couldn't help but look at the people around him, grinning from ear to ear. "Shao-lu, you called me 'Daddy'?" he asked, a mix of amazement and joy in his voice. Shao-lu looked at the gentle expression on Bayu-Ya's face and the expectant look on Lu-Ching's face, and then he nodded, "Yes, Dad, that's me, the one with the miraculous effects of the Dao embryo pill!"

A prompt appeared before my eyes. I blinked, finding it hard to believe. Could it really be this simple? After taking the Da Dan, it can help people to completely transform and rebuild their Foundation, this is a rare treasure in the world. Just one pill can change a person's Destiny. Against All Odds, I couldn't help but be amazed by the effects of this pill. Upon careful consideration, it made sense that being such a waste at 40 years old, the first reward for completing a task, naturally, had to be this type of pill. Otherwise, how could the counterattack be achieved?

The text on the system panel reappeared. "You have successfully made Lu-Chang-Ching, who hasn't smiled in 30 years, smile," it stated. However, that alone was not enough. The system continued, "Please spar with your Marshal Saint father and successfully hit him." The mission reward is innate sword intent. Thinking of the miraculous effects of the Dao embryo pill, the reward for this second task immediately made me somewhat excited.

After that, I looked around, trying to see if there were any handy weapons. Lu-Chang-Ching looked at me and quickly asked, "Shao-lu, where do you want to go?" I spoke up, "Down, Lu-Chang-Ching!" Lu-Chang-Ching nodded and carefully set me down, then I stabbed him with a plastic toy sword, making "yaha" sounds at the same time. Lu-Chang-Ching looked at this scene with interest and asked, "Shao-lu, do you want to learn swordsmanship?" I replied, "Fight, while gesturing." Lu-Chang-Ching finally understood that Shao-lu wanted to spar with him. I happily clapped my hands, all right, all right! Lu-Chang-Ching nodded happily and started playing around with his son.

Under Lu-Chang-Ching's ultimate release of water, just 10 seconds later, I stabbed him with a real sword, and he fell to the ground with an "Oops!" "Shao-lu, you knocked down Daddy!" he said, smiling. I couldn't help but smile, happy to have been able to interact with my father in this way. A light curtain appeared before my eyes. Mission accomplished, and the reward was distributed. In that instant, various sword intents flashed through my mind, and the toy sword in my hand unconsciously carried a hint of sharpness.

Lu-Chang-Ching sensed that something was wrong with the sword in my hand and immediately took it from me. "What's going on with the sword in your hand?" he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice. Yuyu quickly asked, "Maybe something's wrong with this toy sword, Lu-Chang-Ching. What's wrong with it?" 

Lu-Chang-Ching examined the sword in his hand, furrowing his brows. "This sword is broken, Dad. Will you buy me another sword?" I looked at the disappearing sword in my hand and thought, "This is broken, but it's also a tool in the game. It's not like I can just break it and not use it." 

At that moment, a prompt appeared before my eyes. I blinked, finding it hard to believe. Could it really be this simple? After taking the Da Dan, it can help people to completely transform and rebuild their Foundation, this is a rare treasure in the world. Just one pill can change a person's Destiny. Against All Odds, I couldn't help but be amazed by the effects of this pill. 

Upon careful consideration, it made sense that being such a waste at 40 years old, the first reward for completing a task, naturally, had to be this type of pill. Otherwise, how could the counterattack be achieved? The system reappeared, stating, "You have successfully str struck your father, Lu-Chong-Shen. Although 99.9% of it was due to your father holding back your own efforts, this is far from enough. Please earn the recognition of your father, the Marshal Saint, and show him your progress."

The mission reward is innate dragon and tiger power. The reward for this task is very generous and is also quite simple. I thought to myself, "This is indeed very easy, one month ago, but I still couldn't gain Lu-Ching's approval. What about this month? Being over a year old now, I should be able to gain his approval." However, the problem was that after this task was triggered, Lu-Chang-Ching had already left home, related to the safety of Diaa and even the entire human race.

A month passed for us, and after the month, I thought about how to gain Lu-Ching's approval without attracting too much attention. I made some noises, pointing at a children's book, to catch Bayu-Ya's attention. Bayu-Ya walked over and said, smiling, "Little Lu, you want to read, Mommy will read it to you, okay?" And then she began reading a story to me, the little duck. By the end of the story, she pointed to the picture and asked, "Shao-lu, what do you see here? Duck!" I replied, "Shao-lu is really smart, You're right, this is a duck, a little yellow duck." Bayu-Ya had a delighted expression on her face, and she asked again, "Is it a bunny? Little Lu, is really smart. How can literacy this text be so complicated for a child to learn?" She was shocked to find that her son seemed to have become even smarter after only a month.

Yuyu was stunned, thinking to herself, "Could it be that his son is a genius? On second thought, it does seem very reasonable after all. He was Lu-Chang-Ching's son, the first Genius of the Great Summer Kingdom, the first 10-ring Marshal Saint in human history, and it was also the only one to date. For so many years, only Lu-Luo's soul seedling had been born. Isn't it normal for Lu-Luo to be slightly more genius?" She quickly accepted this, and brought another book over.

This book is a compendium of animals, featuring a wide variety of animals and even some alien creatures. The Great Summer Kingdom used this to Enlighten small children, and for Lu-Luo, one year was just right. Bayu-Ya began to teach Lu-Luo, sitting in her arms and looking at the animals attentively. There were people in there that she knew and some she didn't know. After a while, Bayu-Ya began to ask questions, and Lu-Luo answered them all, as she listened with a happy smile. "Little Shao-lu is so smart," she thought to herself.

Yuyu confirmed one thing, "Lu-Luo's memory is very good. Little Shao-luo is so smart, bayu-yaa was so happy that she couldn't help but kiss Lu-Luo. When your father comes back, he'll be very



Transfixed, Luu was no longer the scrappy Luu of old, according to the usual practice. Children in this world usually develop until they are 3 years old, before their roots and bones are examined and their talents are tested. Luu's original root and Bone Talent was very poor, but Dow embrio Dan reversed everything. "Against All Odds" is not too much," he said that Luu was also not clear now, his own root and Bone talent. Not to be late, in the end, not bad, anyway. Bay Yuya was very happy, since Luu showed his extraordinary abilities. Luu was out of luck by Yu Ya, who taught Luu every day, reading to him every day, making Luu's head spin. "It's horrible for women to look to their children," Yu Ya said, displaying the intensity of the education immediately. Luu was very difficult, and the heart couldn't help but spit, there's no mistake, I'm only 1 year old, I'm too young. The chicken child couldn't help spitting out, "Chicken child is not so chicken!" Yu Ya tried to calm down, feeling that this was too much, using phrases like some words could easily cause the child's rebelliousness and should be orderly and gradual. Yu Ya consulted a number of people and realized she had indeed been too hasty, letting a 1-year-old child read and write. "That's crazy, however," she said, in this way, the fact that Luu had a superb memory and could already read and write spread in the past two days, a lot of people came, one after another. There were Elders from the Lou family and the B family, as well as some children older than Luu who looked at him with curious faces. Even his parents, Pop and Yuy Ya, he hadn't seen in a month, took time out of their busy schedules to make a trip home from the outer planets. At this moment, a large family surrounded Luu, grandparents, Grandma and Grandpa, Aunts and Uncles, Brothers and Sisters, and Li Chang, who had just rushed back. Yuy Ya held three words and asked, "Luu, little Luu, how do you pronounce these three words?" Luu glanced at the crowd, then at Bay Yuya, and finally at Lu Chang Xang, his heart was helpless. He was only slightly displaying his talent. "Ah, how did he cause such a big commotion?" Pop asked, still back in time.

Luu spoke, and Lu Chang Xang responded, those three words were quite literally his old man's name. When he pronounced these three words, the whole family cheered. Everyone was excited. Grandparents, Grandmothers, and Grandfathers all smiled. Aunts and Uncles applauded. My Brother and Sister all opened their mouths in Surprise. Even Li Chang Xang looked surprised, by Yuy Ya expressed proudly, "That's right, isn't it? You still don't believe me when I say my son can read and write?" Luu was very tempted to say, "Sit down, sit down. Don't be six. What's wrong, you see it?" he glanced at the progress of the mission, this task with Lu Chang Xang's sentence, was truly worthy of the title, "My son". It was directly completed, born with the power of dragons and tigers, in hand. Luu felt that a constant stream of divine power, and instantly didn't dare to move for fear of showing a little. Luckily, the power was quickly mastered, and there was no embarrassing situation where a gentle squeeze would break something. At this moment, Lu Chang Xang was very happy. He hugged Luu, and said with a smile, "Haven't seen you for a month, did you miss Dad?" by Yuy Ya replied on the side, "Of course, I miss you, almost every night. Little Lou, calling out for Daddy, where is Daddy?" Lu Chang Xang's eyes got a little heartbroken, "No way, Daddy, I just couldn't spare the time. Little Lou, don't blame Daddy. Daddy has very important things to do outside. They can't stay with us all the time."

Luu seemed to understand, and nodded, he seems to understand what I'm saying." Lu Chang Xang turned his head to Bay Yuy Ya and said, "Happily, he then turned his head and looked at Luu once again. Come on, call Daddy, and listen!" Lu Chang Xang laughed, a large group of people around them froze, then all couldn't help but burst out laughing. Yuy Ya teaches Luu that "Lu Chang Chang" is his father's name, and Luu memorized those three words, and knew that it was his father's name. "It's straight to name calling, nothing wrong with it," Lu Chang Xang said, smiling instantly, since he was Luu's name.

The System is also confused, Lu Chang did not continue to dwell on the matter of his son calling out his name. He turned his head to Bay Yuy Ya, "Since little Lou you read and write, let's hire an enlightened teacher for him." By Yuy Ya replied, "Isn't it too early, he's only a year and a half old." When Luu heard this, he became a bit anxious. By Yuy Ya continued, "When Luu who was on the side heard this, he became a bit anxious." By Yuy Ya reads to him every day, and he listens, but also invites an enlightened teacher to come, and by Yuy Ya was surprised, "What's wrong with that?"

he's just not the age to learn right now, no reading, Luu spoke in a hurry. By Yuy Ya snorted a laugh, and looked at Lu Chang Xang, "Look, little Lou, you doesn't even want to read, and you still want to hire an enlightened teacher, it's just too early." The slightly older boy on the side, about 6 or 7 years old, also spoke up, but was immediately whisked away by his ears with a ghostly cry. Lu Chang Xang pondered for a moment, and nodded, "In that case, let's wait until he's a little older, and then hire him a teacher." By Yuy Ya nodded, "I've heard them say learning this kind of thing must not be forced, must be guided, otherwise it will make the child rebellious." By Yuy Ya said, "I'll buy some more picture books afterward, enlightening readings, teach him by storytelling, being a kid is boring, Eat, Play, Sleep, do nothing all day, can't do what I want to do." By Yuy Ya explained, he felt a little tired after thinking. The only thing that he did most every day was to lie in Bay Yuy Ya's arms, and listen to his telling Enlightenment stories. There were times when Bay Yuy Ya told Luu stories about her youth, as well as telling some of the legendary Deeds of Lu Chang Xan.

This was the only way for Luu to contact the outside world. Luu listened intently, Bay Yuy Ya also didn't expect that Lu would like to hear this so much, so she told him more, through By Yuy Ya's narration. Luu's understanding of this world was enriched, since the beginning of the star Marvin Age in just over 2,000 years, there have been nearly a thousand living planets occupied by humans, and 688 life planets in the hands of great SI.

A last resort, BYU had shipped some textbooks to Luu for him to study, in addition to recognizing words. Luu also tried to hold a pen and write some simple words. When Luu's old Marshall Saint father came back a month later, he was so surprised that he couldn't keep his mouth shut after hearing about him. "You've been reading and writing since you were a year old," he said, his eyes wide with amazement. "Are your jeans that strong?" Lu Chang Xang was a bit surprised, but he accepted it very quickly after all his deeds were truly Heaven-defying, especially compared to Luu learning how to read and write. "Don't expect little Luu to be so smart," Lu Chang Xang said with a chuckle. "You've already made a name for yourself. Maybe I should invite a teacher over for you," he suggested, and Luu didn't refuse this time. This time he nodded and said, "Good. Why did you agree this time?" Lu Chang Xang was a bit curious because he grew up Luu, and he had witnessed his growth. "This answer makes Lu Chang Xang smile as he picked up Luu and lifted him up, saying, 'Our little Luu has grown up in the future. He'll grow taller than Daddy Luu.' Luu was lifted above his head and felt this heavy expectation just then. The system next to him, the Marshall, spoke up, saying, 'Chapter 7: Natural Ability to Forget. Here we go.' Luu couldn't help but have his eyes light up when he saw the mission appear, trigger learning tasks. He has the approval of his father, the Marshall St. Lu Chong Xang, but that alone is not enough. You need to gain the approval of more people. Next, please gain the approval of your teacher, Li Guang. Quest reward. Can't forget Luu stared at the panel and looked at the quest and his heart couldn't help but sigh with relief. It seems that the system didn't notice the problem and issued the quest as usual. So that's good. Although Lu Chong Xang thought the worst outcome was that he would have to rely solely on his own efforts. But since he could use the system, it was natural for him to use it ruthlessly. "That's not shabby," he thought to himself. "Don't suffer and eat them, hard. That's not shabby" Lu Chang Xang thought. The rewards for this quest weren't from the martial arts department, but they weren't bad all the same. Once he was able to get this reward, it would then be an epic enhancement for Luu's memory. Learning many things in this age would become much easier. Lu Chang Xang smiled, remembering that Luu was only thinking about simple things. When another month had passed, Lu Chang Xang promised Luu that he would find a teacher for him. But the teacher's candidate was a problem. Luu was only one and a half years old. It was too early to invite those famous teachers over, and also, it wouldn't be fair to those teachers. Lu Chang Xang didn't want to just find a teacher for Luu; he had to choose the right one carefully. Lu Chang Xang then remembered the name Li Guang Thai and wanted to find him as a teacher. He asked Li Guang Thai, who was famous for teaching, to come over and teach Luu. "Why did you want to find him?" Lu Chang Xang asked. They could only wait for Li Guang Xiang to make a decision slowly. Luu wasn't in a hurry. He wasn't expecting the speed of completing the tasks to be too fast. Otherwise, the system would find out that he was wool gathering, and that's bad. Li Guang Thai offered to come and teach Luu. "Good. Why did you agree this time?" Lu Chang Xang asked. Lu Chang Xing was curious because he had grown up Luu. "This answer makes Lu Chang Xang smile as he picked up Luu and said, 'Our little Luu has grown up in the future, ah, he'll grow taller than Daddy Luu.' Lu Chang Xang lifted Luu up and put him in his arms. Luu felt this heavy expectation just then. The systems next to him, the Marshall, spoke up, saying, 'Chapter 7: Natural Ability to Forget. Here we go.' Finally, Luu couldn't help but have his eyes light up when he saw the mission appear. The system had advanced to 40 years, causing these quests to change from hellish difficulty to easy mode. Luu couldn't help but smile because of the system's wool gathering. And he was going to be Invincible at this time. Lu Chang Xang looked at Li Guang and asked knowingly, "How is that? Very unusual." Li Guang said it was normal, that children at that age didn't speak completely, and Luu's case was no exception. "It's just early intelligence. You won't necessarily become a genius in the future. Please ask Mister Lee to take the trouble, and Lu Chang Xang thought that Luu wouldn't become a Marshall Saint, Emperor, or King, no matter how hard he tried. After all, this was a story Lu Chang Xang had never seen. Lu Chang Xang then left, only Li Guang and Luu were left in the room. A normal, small child would have cried long ago when they saw their parents gone, but Luu looked calm. Li Guang stroked his beard, squatting down to inquire, "Little Luu, what do you want to learn?" Luu said, "I want to learn martial arts." Li Guang smiled and asked, "Why do you want to learn martial arts?" Luu said, "I want to be strong." Li Guang asked, "Getting stronger for what?" Luu thought for a moment before saying, "Just in case." Li Guang nodded, "But at your current age, it's not the time to learn martial arts. First, you're too young to practice martial arts. Not only will it not have much effect, but there are also side effects that will affect your growth and development." Luu frowned and pondered for a while. He then said, "I'll study literature." Just by the way, he had been given the natural ability to forget everything. If he trained his mind to learn literature, it wouldn't be a handful. Chapter 8: New Year's Eve. Luu was really too small, only so a little big. Li Guang Thai, a little more, with many grandchildren, knows how to teach children. Luu wasn't generally intelligent, only a year and a half old, but a responsive mind than the average four or 5-year-old. He was doing well despite keeping a low profile. Otherwise, it would be even more amazing. The system had given Lu Chang Xiang a quest to teach him. Another month had passed. The weather was getting colder and colder, and snowflakes were falling from the sky. The house was still warm enough that even wearing short sleeves felt hot. Luu estimated it was almost the Spring Festival in this world. Lu Chong Xang was going to be an imaginary 3 years old. But since he was only 1 year and 7/8 months old. The next quest still hadn't triggered, Luu was unbothered. He just followed Li Guang and studied every day. This High Marshall world was not only explosive in terms of Force values but also had advanced technology, far superior to the previous world. Interstellar migration was impossible for humans without sufficient technological support. That's why people in this era needed to learn not only martial arts but also a lot of cultural knowledge. It could be very hard work. Luu looked at the snowflakes outside the house. His thoughts drifted a bit. Li Guang stopped toying with days, Luu's rate of progress was very fast, and if it continued like this, he would finish the elementary school program like Li Guang, as his son imagined.



Such an intelligent child, a simple early prodigy was not enough to describe him at all. However, once he thought about how demonic a performance he was, as the only son of the Marshall Saint, it all became reasonable. Lu Chang Chang was the only Marshall Saint in the 2,000 years of the Star Marshall era. How powerful should he be? It wasn't normal for his children to be a little contrary that was all Rangai could do to convince himself with such a statement. Even by Yu Ya and LU Chang xang became confident. It seemed quite reasonable what are you thinking, RI Guang asked gently. It's going to be New Year's Eve soon, is it going to be a big one? Luu said, the Spring Festival is definitely very lively, it's the most lively festival in Ard Dasia. Like gangai said with a smile, "Is teacher going home?" Luu turned his head to look at Li Guang Tai. It should be going back, Li Guang Tha stroked his beard and said thoughtfully, probably in a few days I'll go back. Luu nodded and looked at Li Guang Tha over the past month, his teacher had treated him very gently, never saying a single swear word or heavy word, and his knowledge was incomparable. No matter what questions L you asked, he was able to answer them. What if I miss my teacher during the New Year, luu said when Li Guang Tha heard this, his heart was touched for a moment, and he smiled and said, "You can call the teacher on the communication phone, and as soon as the new year is over, the teacher will be back back again. It won't take many days." Good Luu, nodded and looked at Li Guang Tha, some more days passed in the twinkling of an eye. Chinese New Year is getting closer and closer; finally, just when luu was about to get bored, reading the quest was triggered again. Luu who was originally drowsy instantly came to life. Even though you have gained the approval of your teacher, Li Guang Tha, this is only the beginning. You need to defeat your childhood companion, the sixth realm Grandmaster, Yaning. Mission reward: Realm breaking pill. Luu looked at the panel and couldn't help but furrow his brows. Let him defeat sixth realm Grandmaster Yaning. He's only a year, seven or eight months old. You can't even practice martial arts. How do you fight? Nope, Luu reacted. Since Yaning was Luu's childhood companion, he should only be about 2 years old now, and not a sixth realm sect Master at all. In that case, the task is again very simple. I just don't know where is this little friend, Y Guanin. When can I see him, and isn't it a good idea to beat up kids like that? No matter, for the sake of the mission reward, let's suffer him first. I'll take the blame. As soon as the New Year rolled around, Luu's classes stopped for the time being, and the teacher went back to his hometown. During this period of time, the Marshall Saint residence could be described as very lively. Even Lu Chang Shang had taken the time to come back for the New Year. Luu met a number of cousins, the Lou family is a martial arts family. Lu Ch CH was the strongest contemporary and the nominal head of the family. However, because he didn't have the time to be any kind of head of the family and deal with the various trivial matters in the family, most of the things were handed over to Luu's eldest Uncle, Lu Shong. Those cousins of his usually lived in the Lou family's ancestral residence. According to a cousin, Lu Shu, the place was rough. The size of the Marshall Saints residence, sure that's big enough, and there's a private life planet in the family, and the kids go over there all the time. Although that was also from Lu Chan Chang in short, Luu's side was the one that was more like the original family, opposed to the original family, a martial arts family. It couldn't be helped who made Li Chang Shang the strongest contemporary. Lu you also asked these cousins, what strong people were on the side of this family. Listening to the introduction of those cousins, a few words from Lou you probably knew something about the situation on this family's side. There wasn't even a single Marshall Emperor and there was only an elderly Marshal King sitting there. Lu Chong xong on the other hand was a young Marshall Saint; it's more than normal to have such a gap. Not to mention the Lou family's own family, there was no way that any martial arts lineage of the human Community could be compared to a martial Saint. After that, Luu also got to know a group of cousins that were relatives on his mother's side, by Yuya's side. There are also children of friends whose parents know them among the group. Luu quickly found the name mentioned in the system. Mission: yuguan Shen yuguan Ching's old man's name was Yui. Yui was Lu Chang xang's university classmate. His realm was an eighth realm Marshall King. Although there was no way to compare it with Lu Chang xang, it was a pivotal bigwig on any Planet. Unlike Lu Chong xang who only had Luu as his only seedling, Yui had a full complement of six children, Yaning was the youngest of his children. He was slightly older than Luu and, this year, he was a full three years old. Luu sucked in a breath of calm air when he heard this news. It was actually a 3-year-old Powerhouse, terrifying as it was, this should be considered mission accomplished if we beat him right. A couple of previous quests had passed this one should pass as well. Lu you thought this while staring wistfully at Yaning. What next excuse will it take to face him fair and square and then defeat him. Chapter 9: a brand new mission for Lu you found. He sat in the corner staring blankly at the ceiling and wondering what he was thinking. This Yaning, he looks a bit dull. Luu opened his mouth and asked, are you yuguan Chung. When Yuguan Ching heard the voice, he instantly came back to his senses and looked at the person in front of him. Noded and said, "It's me". Luu asked again, how old are you, Yaning? Four years old, did you learn martial arts, learned a little? Can I see it? You're not 3 years old yet, are you? You can't learn martial arts until you're three. It's not like I'm planning on learning martial arts. I just want you to show me the ropes. That won't work either. You haven't learned anything, have you. Of course, I learned. Don't believe you. If you have learned it, why won't you show it? That's don't explain. You just haven't learned, then I'll show you. Yes, little children are little children. Just the simplicity of all the agitation, yaning was directly fooled, on the spot. Show Luu the martial arts he learned. After Luu finished reading it, he immediately said, "That's it. It's not that good." Yaning was offended at that moment, do you know who my father is? How dare you say that my martial arts are not good. These few moves of mine were taught to me by my father, good man. You're a father figure aren't you! Luu immediately asked who is your father, Yinaning grunted and said, "My father. Father, but he is an eighth realm Marshall King. Known as Yui Marshal King." You actually said that my martial arts are not good. Luu smiled and asked, then do you know who my father is, Yinaning froze for a moment, and also asked, who is your father, Luu said, my father is a 10um marshall Saint. Which is just the only one in the star Marshall calendar for 2,000 years. Yug Guanin, these words directly silenced yancheing. Dry, he completely didn't expect that the Arrogant brat in front of him was actually that Marshall Saint's only son. After a long silence, yuguan Ching said with a stiff upper lip, "Your father is a mashall Sage. That's your father. What does it have to do with you? What gives you the right to say that my martial arts are not very good? Makes perfect sense. That's not your average three or four-year-old, thinking skills anymore." Luu nodded then come and fight me, let me see how good you are, hearing this, Yaning couldn't help, but laugh out loud. Just you. Are you afraid, Lu, asked. Yinaning glanced in his old man's direction. Deflated and said, I'm afraid of crying. You out and then getting a beating from my father. That's not worth it. Yinaning, can still distinguish between the Lesser and the Greater. I think you're just scarred Luu said, I'm really not afraid. You're just scared, then let's have a contest, it's a deal, you're not allowed to cry. Good luu smiled and nodded. Simple agitation once again had an effect. Then the two found an unoccupied room and began to go through the motions. Yuguan Ching said to himself in his mind never lay a heavy hand on him. This one is the only son of the Marshall Saint, if he is really injured. It is not a joke. However, even if you

Although it was only suitable for martial artists below the seventh realm, Luu hadn't officially started practicing yet, and he didn't know when he would break through to the seventh realm. Right after Luu completed this Quest, the system suddenly appeared with a new Quest: "Lu, hurriedly look at the panel in front of you. Trigger special assignment. Not only did you manage to defeat You Bane, but you also beat him into submission and made him recognize you as his elder brother." This reminds you of many of your childhood companions. Next, you need to gain the recognition of more of your childhood companions, so that they all recognize you as the leading brother. Revitalize the reputation of the Sons of the Marshall Sage: 10 companions recognition obtaining a lower grade Heaven and Earth Treasure. 20 companions approval obtaining a medium grade Heaven and Earth Treasure. 50 companions approval obtaining a top-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure. 100 companions approval obtaining a top-quality Heaven and Earth Treasure. It's worth noting that this is a staged Quest, and almost all rewards are available if the quest is completed well enough. The time frame for the mission is 1 month. Mission progress: 1110th. This mission is different from the previous ones in that it's actually divided into phases. Luu's eyes lit up at the end of the panel. The task progress shows 1/10th, that is to say, as long as Luu completes this task, he will automatically enter the next stage of the task. And the system is generous. The little brother Yub Wanin, who has just been taken in, is actually counted in Chapter 10. Clarifying the universe so far, among many missions, Luu had accomplished this Mission. It could be said was the most difficult one of course. It's only relative if you put it in 40 years. There's no doubt that it must be hellishly difficult, but if you put it in the present, it's just slightly harder than the previous task. Just a little bit harder. Seeing Luu with a contemplative look, Y Guan Ching who was on the side, as if he had triggered his little brother's senses, hurriedly opened his mouth and asked, "Why is Big Brother brooding?" Luu turned his head to look at Yaning and spoke, "I want to make a great cause, to revitalize my human community, and lighten the burden on my father. But there's no way that I don't have many people under me at all. So what do you think should be done about this? Is it still hard to find Manpower? Big Brother, look outside; many guests have come today. There are big brothers' relatives and there are also Big Brother's relatives' children. I think all of them are suitable candidates." Yaning quickly substituted into the role of little brother and began to make suggestions. It feels strange to have one person as a minion, but if you pull a whole bunch of people over when the time comes, if anyone doesn't come over, it's someone else's problem. When Luu heard this, he gave Yaning a glance. Then he patted his shoulder. Then this task will be given to you. "Hauh me, Yanching," yelled Luu. Yanching pointed at himself and couldn't help but feel a bit dumbfounded. "What's the matter, you don't dare?" Luu glanced at Yancing. The simple provocation once again produced an effect. Without thinking, Yancing said, "Of course, I dare. But only after I said that, I realized something was wrong. It wasn't that simple. Yanching thought for a moment and spoke, "Although I dare to do these things, I'm not very good at them, and I'm afraid that because of my problems, I'll delay Big Brother's big event and won't be able to make up for it." It had to be said that Yuang Ching's brain was still very flexible and not as dull and clumsy as it appeared on the surface. Luu listened to these words, pondered for a moment, and spoke, "This is a simple matter. Yaning looked at him. Luu continued, "You don't want to come up here and say to those people that I'm going to take them in as little brothers. Which people will definitely be unwilling to do. Yaching nodded. Luu continued, "Just tell them this; just tell them that as the Marshall Saint's only son and the young Master here, I'm going to individually invite them all over for dinner and drinks as a way of thanking them for their visit and remember not to call the adults over." Yanching heard this, and subconsciously said, "We can't drink, can we?" Luu laughed. "Are you stupid? Even if you can't drink wine, you can substitute tea for wine, and drinks for wine. Yaning nodded. "I understand. First, trick them over. Whoever doesn't worship big brother won't be let go." Luu said somewhat breathlessly, "This definitely won't work isn't this nonsense? If others aren't willing, I'll use my personal Charisma to convince them." "You Guing understood at once what Big Brother means is use your fists." Luu, the wood is too rotten to carve. "Luu didn't bother to say much and patted his shoulder. Go on, you tell them that I'll be waiting for them at Ya Guang Pavilion. Guarantee to complete the task." Yuing had an excited expression on his face, rather like he was about to do something bad. After he finished speaking, he turned around and hurriedly left. Yuing went to pull people in while Luu went to Ya Guang Pavilion. By the way, he got someone to set up the place for a while and get some food and drinks over. The Marshall Saint's residence was very large and there was more than one parlor. The Ya Guang Pavilion was just one of them. These actions of Luu naturally could not be hidden from those adults, but they were not at all concerned about Luu's nonsense and were even a bit happy to see it. After all, it was good for his own son and daughter to have more contact with the Marshall Saint's only son. When Li Chang xang found out about this, he inevitably couldn't help but treat it as a child's nonsense and didn't try to stop it. Y Guang Ching's mobilization ability was good, and with Luu's invitation as the young Master, it was even more like a tiger with wings, and few people didn't give face in just a moment inside the Ya Guang Pavilion, a bunch of people had gathered. Luu glanced over. Good Lord, at the very least hundreds. Luu sat on the main seat because of his height was too short, could only barely show ahead. This is really no momentum. Luu thought about it directly stood on the chair. So it is just right. Inside the Yagang Pavilion, as the crowd took their seats, Luu did not shy away from the stage and stood on his chair to look around at the crowd, along with the Gaze sweeping. Originally, there was still some noise in the hall, but gradually quiet down. Everyone looked at Luu with considerable interest. Yuing sat next to Luu and was even more expectant. Luu thought for a moment and spoke, "I invited everyone here today, just to discuss great things together. All of you are the hope of the future, whether or not the future can clarify the universe cannot be accomplished by me alone. Even if I break through to the Marshall Saint Realm, I still cannot do those. My incompetent Marshal Saint old man is an example of that. But just because he can't, doesn't mean we can't. That's the main reason I pulled you guys over."



In the Yagang Pavilion, there stood a group of young scholars who couldn't help but gaze at each other after hearing these words. What did they just hear - a group of children wanting to change the sky and clarify the Jade? Was this a rebellion? Kids like this nowadays were so bold, their mental state was at an all-time high. It was obviously amusing to watch, but not because of the children's naivety, but because their potential was undeniable. The leader of the group, the only son of a Marshall Saint, was the epitome of discipline and restraint, unlike the others who were either from martial arts families or the sons of powerful Marshals and Emperors. The worst offender was the son of a renowned Master. When placed outside, each of them was a significant son or a young lady, let alone a group of people gathered together. Their potential as individuals was limitless, but would they be able to remember what they were saying now, when they grew up? People grow and change, and even the strongest thoughts can be loosened with time.

Just outside the pavilion, the crowd seemed to be in a state of slumber. The parents of the children were oblivious to the commotion, and were more concerned with their own affairs. The only one who seemed to be paying attention was a figure in the shadows, known as the Hidden One. They were watching the children with a calculating eye, and seemed to be taking note of everything.

When the children's voices rose in excitement, Lu Yu slapped the table and asked, "Are you all rats? Why won't you say anything?" The simple provocation immediately produced an effect, and someone stood up and said, "I've heard from my dad that the army stationed in the Tianlong Starfield has a serious corruption problem." The man spoke up, and Lu Yu's eyes lit up with interest. He hurriedly opened his mouth, eager to share a secret. "I have to say, that's an unforgivable sin to my dad. I'm afraid that the number of troops stationed on the Tianlong Starfield is only 1 million - even less than 1 million - but the number they reported is surprisingly 3,800,000. This is an incomprehensible act of embezzlement, bloodshed, and corruption. There are quite a few people who know about this, but no one dares to speak out."

Chin Yun Li had even subconsciously mimicked his dad's tone when he spoke these words, which he had accidentally heard were being spoken at this very moment. Lu Yu listened intently, shocked to the core. The system was corrupt, riddled with problems, and there was no exception in any world, no matter how advanced. This world had already reached 2,000 years in the Marshal calendar, and there were countless issues that couldn't be easily solved by one or two people.

Even the great Marshall Saint, Lu Chang xiang, would find it difficult to eradicate these problems. The 10-Realm Marshall Saint was indeed very powerful, but he was only one person, and still seemed a bit weak in the face of the entire system. The teacher, Li Kwang taii, also discussed these issues, but at the time, only mentioned them casually and didn't delve any further. Lu Yu remembered those words, but didn't realize the extent of the problems until now. It couldn't be that simple, just by casually asking.

Just then, a little girl stood out and spoke, "I've also heard my dad say that the largest religion in the Great Summer Country, the Divine Light cult, is suspected to have a connection with the Extraterrestrial evil God. With 10 billion followers, the Divine Light cult is spread all over the major planets. If they're disposed of, the consequences shouldn't be too horrible. But it's a major event that shakes the foundation of the country. So we can only turn a blind eye to it and hope that the Extraterrestrial evil God doesn't have any malice towards humans." Another shocking revelation was about to be shared by another kid Brother, and this group of siblings continued to dish out secrets.

Outside the Yagang Pavilion, the Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors who had come to watch the group of siblings party and reminisce about their youth at this moment revealed expressions of shock and horror. They had seen something worse than a ghost, something that would give them nightmares for the rest of their lives. Even the great Marshall Saint, their own fathers, wouldn't be able to do much good.

When one kid Brother suddenly spoke up, saying that the number of troops stationed on the Tianlong Starfield was much lower than reported, and that the embezzlement was on an enormous scale, the crowd was electrified. The parents couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, and some of them looked around nervously. Even the major families, who had controlled the channels of vocalization, couldn't stop the children's words from spreading. The messages had already been scribbled, and no one could erase them.

As the children continued to share their secrets, the Marshall Kings and Marshall Emperors were left wondering if they should intervene and stop the group. But it was too late now. The ship had already sailed, and there was no return. One secret after another was revealed, and the situation became increasingly dire. It was clear that the human community was on the brink of collapse.



Recognizing him as a big brother, lines of text kept appearing on the light screen in front of his eyes. The first stage of the mission was complete, and he had been recognized by 10 companions. He had acquired a rare treasure, the Heaven and Earth Vermilion fruit, at the Yugo level, sixth order, with perfect quality effects. Consuming it could strengthen his physical body, increase his cultivation, and improve his physique to a certain extent.

However, it was essential to be cautious. If his physical body was not strong enough, taking the treasure carelessly could result in a certain probability of bursting and dying. The second stage of the mission was complete, and he had been recognized by 20 companions. He had acquired a medium-grade Heaven and Earth Treasure, Pichy Lucky Stone, ranked seventh in quality, with excellent wearable effects, generated by the brave Pichy Janun.

The Pichy Lucky Stone had the ability to turn bad luck into good fortune, as well as calm the house, ward off evil spirits, attract wealth and treasures, and increase the person's luck. Description: the brave man in various forms; only eating and not working; doing nothing, a strangely shaped Stone; it vaguely seemed to possess the breath of a brave man and a trace of the power of a brave man's Divine Soul.

This was the end of the panel text. Lou couldn't help but stare, wondering about the top-quality Heaven and Earth wonders and the top-quality Heaven and Earth wonders, which had vanished. Could the system still be privatized? Luu was puzzled and, after taking a closer look, immediately knew the reason. The progress of the mission was 2350th. This meant that, among 100 people, only 23 had sincerely recognized him, while the others had followed the trend. Although he had recognized Luu as his elder brother on his lips, his heart didn't fully approve of him.

Luu was surprised but realized it was normal. He had said some words and done nothing, and his goal was to gain the recognition of many people and make them follow with sincerity. However, this was a fool's errand, as most people had recognized him as Luu's elder brother out of fear of their father, Marshall Saint Lu Changchang. The fact that only 23 people could genuinely recognize Luu as their big brother was surprising, especially given that kids were easily fooled. There was another possibility: Luu's companions were not many.

It was possible that these people were not genuinely recognizing Luu, but rather pretending to be his companions for some reason. This realization led Luu to think that he wasn't strong enough to change at this point and that he still had a long way to go. Faring-ywang Pavilion was known to Marshall Saint Lu Changchang, and Lu Changchang initially thought it was just a group of kids fooling around. What could be wrong? Was it possible to break the sky?

However, it later turned out that the group of kids was actually going to break the sky. Secret after secret was exposed, and the children's words, though not necessarily harmless, were backed up by the group of Marshall Kings and Emperors, whose parents had spoken. If their parents hadn't spoken, the children couldn't have made it up. Believability was simply not good enough.

Lu Changchang couldn't help but cover his forehead when he heard these news. As the only Marshall Saint of the human community, going around to put out fires was already very tiring. The New Year's Eve effort had thought to be able to take a rest, but the result was that this group of little brats had stabbed out such a big basket in the twinkling of an eye.

The parents, though big-hearted, could say these things in front of the children. Lu Changchang was tired for a while, and the news that came afterward was more than enough to make Ling Chang Qing cry and laugh. A bunch of brats actually wanting to clarify the Jade and change the sky and Earth; what a big mouth. Do they know what it really means to do this? How big a price to pay? How dare they just say something like that?

What made Ling Chang Qing most helpless was that this matter was brought up by his precious son Lu, and also let all the people recognize him as their leading elder brother, and in the future, they will follow him to change the sky and the Earth. When Lu Changchang started cursing in his heart, he muttered, "You're only 3 years old, you're only a year and 8 months old, aren't you? How can you actually say something like that? It's more like being the leader of a bunch of brats for a while."

Ling Chang Qing's heart was pounding, and his mind was full of mixed feelings. Although Lu had surprisingly stirred up such a big basket, these were not really big problems for Lu Changchang. He knew some of those dirty and sorted things about the great SI as well as the entire human community. Only this time was it poked into the open by his own son and a bunch of bears.

Since this was the case, Lu Changchang couldn't pretend that nothing had happened. If he did, he wouldn't be able to become a 10 real Marshall Saint. The fact that he knew and was exposed made him uneasy and also a bit relieved. It was vague but also proud to see his L Chan Chang son, who had started stirring up the wind and clouds at such a young age, haha. The shadow of him back then was there, but he couldn't be rewarded categorically for his son's mess.

By the end of that day, Lu was out of luck. His " ass" went straight to Blossom to get clarified; let's get you to make a change, Yu Yu, take the lead, big brother still fooling around, by Yuya Yao asked angrily for such a long time. It was the first time Lu Yu had seen Bey'yo's angry face and it looked like she was really angered, so her hands were a bit heavy.

Luu took this beating but didn't change his mind. As he raised his head and said, "I'm not a 2-year-old anymore. You can't treat me like a child anymore. Not a child, but a 3-year-old this time." Hearing this, Bay'yo was instantly infuriated and asked, "You're so young, what do you know? You're Lu Changching's son, that's why you're exempt from the chastisement. Just let me teach you a lesson if you were someone else's son this matter wouldn't have ended so simply do you know what you're doing?"

He responded, "I know what I'm doing." Bayiao's voice softened slightly, and she said, "It's just that by doing this you're making trouble for your father. Your father doesn't share his worries, can you understand that? Understood." Lu said, since you understood, then you're going to do it again in the future.

By Yao asked again, "Could it be that I caused all this trouble?" Lu looked up and asked, "Isn't it because Yu Ya asked rhetorically, I'm just a 3-year-old child when did I have that much power?" Lu spread his hands with a helpless face. By Yao couldn't help but stare, and instantly reacted, "The trouble certainly wasn't caused by luu, but rather everyone had been treating it as if they didn't see it and now it was being poked out by a bunch of kids." This logic was very simple, but it was also after all an adult and a seventh realm Grandmaster.

So she wouldn't be so simply sidetracked. Lu couldn't deny his side of the issue and turned his attention back to his trouble, which was that he wasn't strong enough yet if he was strong enough then there would be a change.

Afterward, Lou, you couldn't help but inquire, "Were the geniuses either assassinated, or did they succeed halfway through the process, or become great Masters or Marshall Kings? I guess Lu Changxang said lightly, Chapter 17: Pillars of the Human Race. Such a genius only achieves Grandmaster or Marshall King in the end, Luu blinked, feeling a bit incredulous. This was a bit different from his expectations. What do you mean by only achieving Grandmaster and Marshall King?" Lu Changxang glanced at him, showing a little bit of tiny talent at the beginning of the realm of Earth stage of martial arts, soaring forward, causing others to exclaim, "They are absolute demons! Surely, they are the next martial Saints!" This kind of person simply doesn't have too many of them. After all, there are so many people in the human race, and there are simply too many so-called Supreme demons, and once in a century, Geniuses. A bunch of people like that have to show up every year, universities, they treat them like babies, and take them all under their wing. But in the end, most of them only grow up, or one in a million never underestimate a Marshall King. Any Marshall King is a true genius. Killed from a bunch of geniuses. Not that kind of pseudo-genius. Luu's eyes were once again refreshed as he listened to these words. He raised his head again and looked at his own old man. Then, what does a Marshall Saint like you, old man, count as me? Li Changxang heard this and smiled, shaking his head. I've just been slightly lucky. Luu was speechless for a while when he heard this. A little bit of luck. The hell with it. The so-called luck is only the humble word of the strong. Other people would be fooled and crippled if they really believed it. After all, there's only one Marshall Saint in this star, and 2,000 years of time long. Just as Father and Son were chatting, the home of their teacher Lwang Thai finally arrived. As a great Master's residence. The house was still very large and quite spectacular when viewed from above. Only that it was a bit shabby when compared to the Marshall Saints' residence. The contrast is like the difference between a palace and a courtyard, but the quadrangle was certainly nice. But compared to the Palace, there was naturally no way to compare. Teacher Lwang Thai had long since received the news that the Marshall Saint had brought his own son to visit, so he deliberately brought a lot of people over to meet them. This could be considered a great deal of excitement. How dignified it must be for a Marshall Saint to personally come over to pay his respects. Told however, Lu Changxang hadn't come over to pay his respects before, so strictly speaking, it wasn't his face. But Luu, I heard that he was the one who suggested that he wanted to come over to see his teacher and pay his respects. Li Guang Thai felt a wave of emotion in his heart. Luu got off the spaceship, and after some pleasantries, Luu carried a long-prepared gift and handed it to Lwang Thai, the teacher. "I've come to pay my New Year's greetings to you, good good good." Li Guang Thai smiled from ear to ear, not to mention how happy he was. "Three good in a row." Then, Liwai put a thick red packet stuffed in Luu's small pocket. This is the pressure money. Luu could clearly feel the heavy weight of this Red Envelope. The teacher is really generous. That said, to the old man, Lu Ching's character should not be so dry. To confiscate the operation of the New Year's Eve money but the mother by yuyo is not necessarily women always think too much. Consider too much. If we really confiscate his new year's money we won't have any funds for activities afterward. Ah, how can we still have the heroes convention? Such thoughts flashed through Luu's mind. Next, the teacher gave Luu and Lu Changxang a brief introduction to his family. Nice guy, not to mention his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The teacher actually even had great-great grandchildren. That's called a crowd pleaser. At the moment, there were hundreds of immediate family members who came this way alone. Everyone wanted to see the Marshall Saint. If you count the ones who didn't show up, there were definitely thousands of them. This is actually normal for many of the older Patriarchs. A sixth-realm patriarch could live for 180 years, while a seventh-realm Grandpatriarch could live for at least 300 years. Although in his later years, his CH, and blood declined and he was in much worse shape than before. His life expectancy did not diminish. A great master who had accumulated wealth for so many years was absolutely terrifying. Feeding a large family can be a breeze. Many martial arts families thrived on accumulating wealth and fame for generations. The Lou Family, would be living in the Lou family's original home if Luu's dad wasn't a Marshall Saint. Just a Grandmaster or a Marshall King. Then he would be living in the Lou Family's original home. The teacher Lwang Thai married three wives, not polygamous rather he is a Great Master and can live for 300 years, but his wife cannot. The years went by. Time went by. The original wife died, even their son died, but he was still alive. What a lonely thing that is in those lonely times. Lwang Thai meets a woman who looks very similar to his original wife. A love affair was formed between the two and a great family was born. Hearing this, Lou, you couldn't help but think, "Mom yuyo is a Great Master and can only live for 300 years. Dad is a martial arts Saint. How long can he live? At least a thousand years? Maybe if in the future, you'll have to endure such loneliness too. Until you find that one similar flower. No, at a realm like Marshall Saint, one should be able to find some life extending treasures that would allow one to live longer. But probably should not survive to the end." At this moment, Lu Changxang was surrounded by a circle of people. Although the teacher, Lwang Thai also reprimanded, but could not resist. They are really too enthusiastic. They all want to find Lu Changxang to ask for an autograph. The scene was like the most Ardent fan who had finally met his Idol. Even more exaggerated. After all, idols and whatnot were simply not enough to be compared to Marshall St Lu Changxang. In the entire Granda, Lu Changxang's popularity was said to be second. Then, absolutely no one dared to say first. Facing these people, Lu Changxang didn't show any impatience. Instead, he was very cordial and gave autographs to all of them. After all, in a way, he became so strong to guard these ordinary people. Seeing this scene, Luu suddenly asked teacher, "How long can a Marshall Saint live?" After hearing this question, Ri Guang Tai froze, then slowly said, "I'm afraid that only the Marshall Saint himself knows this question. However, at a conservative estimate, it will live for about 2,000 years at the very least." 2,000 years. Luu couldn't help but be a little surprised when he heard this reply. So long. Lwang Tai couldn't help but glance at Luu the son with filial piety and said with a smile, "It is a blessing for all human beings to have such a Marshall Saint in life. No, the entire human Community." You still don't understand, I forgot. Back... Sometime ago, before your father had risen to power, the Great Spirits... and even the entire human race, didn't have the peace and quiet it has now. Now however, it has become relatively much more peaceful. And backwaters, such as Blue Star, haven't been at war for many years. This is all thanks to the Marshall Saint. He is the pillar of the entire human race. Chapter 18: Attacks and Defense Change Form. While Luu was talking to his teacher, Li Guang Thai, not everyone's eyes were on Lu Changxang. There were also some people who looked at Luu curiously. A few days ago, after the old Master returned, he said more than once that he had never seen such an intelligent child as Luu. Truly worthy of being the son of a Marshall Saint. So, they were a little curious about how smart this Marshall Saint's only son really was. Seeing it now, one couldn't help but look at each other. Is this really a three-year-old? Or is it an imaginary age? Talking so clearly, thinking so fast. Being able to express his thoughts accurately, and even deriving some topics. Not to mention, 2 or 3 years old. Even if they said seven or 8 years old, there were people who would believe them. It's pretty extraordinary. These people didn't know that during the New Year's Eve, Luu had stirred up such a big basket almost breaking the sky. So, at the moment, they were just focusing on their surprised mannerisms. In that case, even Li Guang had only smelled something out of place and didn't know the whole story, and the rest of them would have no way of knowing. Next, Luu and Lu Changxang were welcomed to their home and received a warm reception from their teacher. Luu didn't treat himself as a guest and, after eating and drinking, he followed a group of children around. Again



At lunchtime, with glowing eyes, not far away Lu Chong succeeded in striking up a conversation with Li Guang Tai, leaving him speechless for a moment as he heard these words because they were identical to what he himself had said to Lu on the spaceship earlier, in an effort to make Lu quit being arrogant and impatient, and at the same time open his eyes to the fact that there's a sky beyond the sky and people beyond the people, even if it was just a short time ago he had made some small achievements; it's no big deal, the road to becoming a martial artist is still far away. Who knew that in the blink of an eye he would use these words as a talking point and begin to snub his teachers. The other kids couldn't help but say that little bugger - "he's quite a talent" - and indeed this story was about a genius without a doubt, directly conquering the group of brats, making them willing to recognize Lu as their leading brother. After that, Lu took out the New Year's money he had just obtained and then had a big party with a large group of kids. He sat on the main seat and accepted the bragging from the crowd. It was a great party with a wide variety of snacks, and even some of the slightly older kids who were too old to fit in looked envious. There was no singing and dancing, simply enjoying themselves and there was no situation like the last one where all kinds of secrets were shaken out. After all, they were only the descendants of their teacher, Li Guang Tai, and didn't know much about the situation yet. Lu had learned his lesson from the last time, therefore what the people were discussing at this banquet was not about the institutional corruption and issues within the daia and the human community as a whole but about the foreign races and the war situation of the evil God races that makes it relatively safe. There are some people who have actually heard something about this, and an 8-year-old child named Liu spoke up, "I've been watching the news for the past few days and there's news about the loss of the battlefield in the Timma Starfield. That's the evil God with the name Star Swallowing God and all the evil God familiars under his command launched a general attack on the human Legion stationed in the Timma Starfield and because it was too sudden, the situation over there is very bad." When these words came out, the crowd burst into chatter. "I've heard about it too before." This star swallowing God who had always maintained a neutral attitude with the humans, "I don't know what happened and suddenly turned against them. These extraterrestrial evil Gods none of them can be trusted. It's a normal situation for them to turn against us, also, I've recently heard that the northern border Battlefield over in the Great Dog Starfield is also waging war. The people were talking each saying the news while Lu you listened carefully. Prior to that, he had very little exposure to this aspect of the news, of course, of course, it is more or less comical to have a bunch of hairless children discussing war matters here, however, Lou you didn't see anything in it, who says kids can't discuss world affairs, not to mention a bunch of kids from the Star Wars era, it's normal to be a little precocious. The credibility of this information, though remains to be tested, but it doesn't stop people from blowing their minds. This time, Lu you glanced at the panel's quest progress, sure enough, it shows 3050, Mission progress bar, added seven points, next he only needed to obtain the approval of 20 more future Companions and he would be able to obtain the top grade, Heaven and Earth wonders. There's less than a month to go, and I don't know if I'll be able to finish absolute great Heaven and Earth wonders. Lu didn't dare to count on it, but this upper great Heaven and Earth wonder may still make an effort, had obtained such a good treasure as the pixil luck suppressing Stone, how powerful could a top grade be? It's really something to look forward to. After a discussion of military matters, the guys eventually came to a conclusion, that's the general situation for Humanity at the moment, and it's not too good, despite what the teacher had said before, pops, Lu Chang Shang had risen to power, Humanity had been far from peaceful, now has become relatively peaceful. This peace, however, is only relative, not that one can really rest on one's laurels, after all the human race only had one martial Saint, the expansion of the human community to its current level can be said to be surrounded by enemies and can only be passively defended. Lu dried a mouthful of juice and said with great pride, "When I grow up, I'll make him attack and defend." Just then, the system Mission triggered again. You managed to gain the recognition of some of your childhood companions, becoming their leading elder brother, barely for the son of the Marshall Saint, restored some Fame but this is far from enough, the next you need to continue to grow your reputation, so that more people see you, so that everyone knows, once the son of the Marshall Saint, back. The system reward was a Dragon Tiger golden Elixir. "Ha we haven't even finished the last mission yet, and we actually have another one," Lu looked at the words in the light screen in front of him, he had always thought that this Quest was just a single line Quest, but he didn't realize that there was actually another Quest. However this mission seems a bit difficult, 1 billion reputation points, it's really a bit of a stretch but the rewards for the quests are equally generous. The Dragon Tiger golden pill, the name alone tells you it's unusual.

Later, Li Chang Chang had a headache just from looking at all the commotion. He could finally be sure that the other day when he stirred up such a big basket it was really his own son's handiwork. Can't really blame anyone on the side, liwai thought this was interesting. He saw nothing wrong with it. At a young age worrying about the country and the people, there is such a sense of Crisis, no why, practicing martial arts what's wrong with it. Liwai felt that Lu had really listened to what he usually taught him and was quite pleased at the moment. Lu Chang Shang glancing at Le guantai and seeing this expression on his face, he couldn't help but say, "Teacher, ah, you don't know, what a big deal This Little Child made a few days ago, oh what else can he make a mess of?" When Li Guang Tai heard this, he was not very convinced. Lu Chang Chang then briefly talked about what happened a few days ago, Li Guang Tai was directly silenced by Lu's dry after hearing this. The gazes that looked at Lu again all changed a bit, no wonder you're so skilled at opening Banquets at the moment. He must have had experience with the big party. After a big mess she ran out just now, is really scary to think about, Lu took out his hands and said, "This one is too big, it's not good. Let's just say what a son. Li Guang Tai remembered when he was young, the things he made a mess of were not small at all. The things that could kill people, offend people, that is simply a common occurrence for someone like a marshall Saint. It's not too common to mention him a marshall Saint. Lu Chan Chang was quite calm about Lu losing his temper. He wasn't afraid of Lu causing trouble, he was afraid that he didn't even have the ability to cause trouble. How could his son, Lu Chong xong, be that kind of incompetent?

After coming back to his home, Lu realized that the situation of the human Community today was not optimistic. If he left for the blue star, he was afraid that he would be attacked in minutes, even if it was an attack, it wouldn't be life-threatening, after all those foreign races wouldn't dare to incur the wrath of a Marshall Saint. But, using it to obtain something was a sure thing. Although as a three year old child, it was still a bit too early to worry about the country. However, as the only son of a Marshall Saint, he couldn't think about it more and in the future, he would have to grow up. Luou you found a very serious problem that's according to the system panel, he was infected with an alien virus when he was just a baby and fell sick at the age of three. He detected that his root bones were strangely poor and only at the age of 12 did he break through the second Realm of the wow and after that he was even more so at the age of 28 before the third Realm of the wow, and only at the age of 40 did he reach the fourth Realm of the wow. Logically speaking as the only son of a Marshall Saint and with his mother being a Grandmaster, his qualifications could never be so poor in here. There might be the shadows of those foreign races and even those evil Gods. A few months ago, he may have caught a big illness, which might have been the tactics of the foreigners even more so after that, it wasn't that Luu thought too much, this thing is indeed strange, and it's worth scrutinizing. There might even be something wrong with it, thinking of this Luu looked over at Lu Chang xong, wanting to talk to his old man about his speculation, but on second thought, he thought, that there was no reason for Lu Chang to be unaware of a problem that even he had thought of. Maybe start checking it out later that night, after Luu returned home

Here is the text with improved English, maintaining the original meaning:

What about after gaining the power of speech, Bayuo looked at Luu with a surprised expression. He was so small, but he actually knew how to utilize the power with the power of speech. You can try to solve some problems, like those raised at our family banquet earlier, Luu said seriously. That won't do, that's not something we can touch, hearing this, Yuya's face changed at that moment. It wouldn't be fun if this aspect was involved. Of course, I know this. Lu, you're not Ed, even with the help of my father's reputation as a marshal, Saint, no one else will care about you. One of these days, I'm going to let you control the world's armies. By Uo Lu Chong Sang, as the grandia Marshall Saint and also the nominal Supreme head of the Granda, had a monstrous amount of power in his hands and was definitely more than just a martial artist and a strong man. But even Lu Chong Sang was unable to control the world's soldiers and horses. To make an analogy, Lu Chong Sang the martial Saint was like the Emperor of an ancient Dynasty, seemingly Supreme and exclusive, but in reality, the operation of society was not as simple as that. The so-called court was just a couple of palaces and a couple of Yaman, and the meal was still served in separate pots. The distribution of the many benefits was subject to constant gaming. No one was naturally deserving of a larger share, and no one was naturally deserving of a smaller share, just because you were the emperor, or just because you were the son of Heaven. You want to be all things to all people. It's just a kid's idea. It's not even possible in reality. So-called Power by its very nature was never top-down, but bottom-up. Of course, it's just a metaphor. Lu Chong Sang was not an emperor, and the diaa of this world was likewise not an ancient Dynasty. The real situation was many times more complicated than this analogy. In the face of Luu's ambition, Yuya said, "Your young age can't change some other things like other children watch educational cartoons and later drawn to help the weak and strong to punish the wicked and evil. Not good, anyway. Yau Ya could only lament that Jeans were simply too powerful. This child was worthy of being the seed of a marshall Saint and was born different from others. Luu ignored Bayu Ya's sentiments. He had discovered that Bayu Ya wasn't too interested in these things. She was good at everything, just a little too simple to rely on. Now it feels a bit unreliable again. Hey, it's really sad. Luu, who was sitting in the crib, couldn't help but sigh. By Yuya gave him a sideways glance, not knowing why she felt as if she was being despised. Is this little guy getting an itchy butt again? Should we beat him up again before he takes control of the world's armies? Chapter, let him see the world. It had to be said that Bayu Ya's reaction was indeed half a beat slower and it took a while before she understood Luu's idea. "You want to go into politics?" By Yuya looked at Luu in surprise and couldn't help but ask, "Pretty much, Lu." Lu nodded. By Yuya's scalp tingled a bit as she couldn't help but spit out, "How old are you, and you want to go into politics? Even if it does come to pass, who's going to listen to you? A yellow mouth, even if you are the son of a martial Saint, your age is just too young. People will just take your words as a joke." Lu looked helplessly at Byu Ya. "Didn't I just say this? That's why I was originally relying on you Mom for help, but after I thought about it, I feel like you can't be relied upon." Byu Yao realized that her hunch just now was correct. One is truly despised. Byu Yao felt her hands itching a bit but held back. "You have to know that you are the son of a marshall Saint. You only need to think about how to become stronger. That's the number one priority. You definitely can't be delayed because of these little things." Lu couldn't help but sigh again when he heard this. "What are you sighing for again?" Byu Yao glared at Lu. "Is there anything wrong with me? Saying this, Mom. What you just said, it's like you just need to study hard. You'll definitely be successful in the future. Don't put off studying because of other little things. But whether it's studying or practicing martial arts. What is it for? And you haven't considered it At all." Lou woke up and drifted a bit, looking at Byu Ya with a hint of hatred in his eyes. "Oh, Mom, you are too simple. Then again, did Dad see you as such an innocent in the first place? He became married to you. Generally speaking, as the wife of a marshall Saint, it's absolutely not right to have such a shallow understanding of these things. Maybe Lu, you were beaten before you could finish your words." The is blooming again. Luu is hard to beat. And there is nothing to be done about it. Who made him so small? It's true that all children are the same. Under the Sun of course. "So, you said it so bluntly and sure enough. It still doesn't work. So next time, we'll have to be more euphemistic. No, it's wrong. Byu Yao glanced at Lu. "Tell me where did you go wrong?" Byu Yao asked coldly. "Well," Luu said in a hurry, "this question directly..." Lou you dry silence. I see you still don't know where you're wrong. Byu Yao snorted coldly and prepared to continue. "No, I know Luu said in a hurry, whom?" Byu Yao let out a nasal sound. "Mom, you are a great Master. How could you not know all this? Just don't take it seriously." With me as a little kid, I'm fooling around. Luu looked helplessly at Byu Yao. "But I actually got carried away and actually thought it was mom who was too simple. It really shouldn't be. Whom?" Byu Yao nodded then seriously educated it's good that you have an idea but you definitely can't put your mind on it. I have not yet reached the age of three, I cannot yet practice martial arts. It is not the Idol, said Luu pitifully. "This is indeed a problem. Generally after reaching the age of three, the root bones are tested, and then martial arts training can begin. So before that, Lu couldn't practice martial arts even if he wanted to. It would seriously affect the body's development in growth. The average child at this age is still playing with mud and does not have this trouble." Lu actually wants to go into politics. By Yuya is also powerless to spit. "You're so young, and besides, being in politics isn't fun." By Yuya said in a serious tone. I'm not doing this for fun, but for diaa for the human Community. Luu was full of passion and righteousness. Bayu Yao immediately felt a headache. She realized that this son of hers over the past few months seemed to be progressing just too fast. You haven't learned to walk yet, and you're thinking about flying, but the thing is, fighting doesn't work either. The hand is light, Lu you does not matter at all." Byu Yao turned to Lou and looked at him with a determined expression. She couldn't let Luu make her feel this way. She couldn't let him continue his foolish ideas. She quickly got up and walked out of the room, leaving Luu crying by himself.

Here is the revised text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

A big mistake to treat martial artists as experts in politics is that the reality could be said to be the exact opposite. The more powerful the martial artist, the greater their brain area broadness, so those dignitaries who deal with the country's big and small affairs are basically some powerful martial artists. This is normal, after all, as there are 688 living planets under the rule of Diaa, and all sorts of big and small governmental affairs are astronomical in scale, even with the help of artificial intelligence. Without the physical strength and energy of a martial artist, ordinary people simply cannot handle it. Sure, when martial artists are strong to a certain extent, they are not interested in these political affairs after all. A grandpa could physically walk in a vacuum, and strong martial artists are basically pursuing the limits of life from a practical point of view, breaking through to the next realm. This will give them a few more years of life, but if they waste their time on these political affairs, they will be putting the cart before the horse. Those dignitaries who are in charge of handling the affairs of the state of Diaa were generally sixth-realm Patriarchs, while the stronger ones were seventh-realm Grand Masters. A Marshal King or powerhouse would be a rare find, which creates a very awkward situation, even for Grandmaster powerhouses who were in charge of ruling the state government of the Grandia. They did not dare to easily offend the Martial Emperor powerhouses or even the families of Marshall Emperor powerhouses. On the day of New Year's Eve, Luu hosted a hero's convention at his home, bursting out with many secrets. A secret that a bunch of kids know, "Don't those at the top who are in charge of dasha's political affairs know about it?" they know this information better than anyone. It's just that they're really bad at moving a Marshall Emperor realm Powerhouse. Could destroy a planet with a serious strike. This is the core of the human war effort, and it is also the Mainstay of the fight against the Fay and against the evil God. Regardless of whether it was the Granda or the human Community, these top powerhouses were needed to stand at the forefront of the fight against the foreign races and evil Gods. These top powerhouses, since they are paid so much, that privileges aspect naturally is essential. The top echelons of Dasha of course had the ability to punish their families and those who were pursued were not forgeries, but so what? We all know very well, what is more important, if it completely chilled the heart of a Marshal Emperor and caused him to defect, then neither desion nor the entire human Federation would be able to Bear the loss, not to mention almost every Marshal emperor had their own people in the high-level Circles of the great SE political Affairs, or perhaps some of them were supported by a Marshal Emperor to get to this position. Various factions, many interests are involved. The water inside is really too deep. This has also led to a situation where many policies, even if they are beneficial to the country and the people are not well implemented, because the constraints are just too many and the TR should not be too much, which has almost become a mess, and you can't even think of cutting it down quickly. But the question is, what happens after the quick cut, will there really be a good outcome? This is something that no one can guarantee. Even if Marshall St L Changan had the ability, but he didn't end up doing that, this also made many reformers sigh with regret. They firmly believe that if they get the support of L Chang xang under their reform, the country of Dasha will definitely be revitalized, nay, the Marshall Saint didn't even look at them, and there was nothing they could do about it. Today, upon seeing that Lu Ching's son, Lu U, had actually appeared in the Dasha high-level Circle, these people's eyes instantly lit up, and they all gathered around to get on good terms with Luu in the face of Luu, these people's words and behaviors appeared extraordinarily humble, trying their best to curry favor. In the face of Bayu Ya, the same was true, all sorts of benefits, as if they didn't want to pay money to promise out, as long as Bay Yuyo agreed, no matter what the conditions were, they could agree. In the face of such a battle, a Yu Ya certainly wasn't overwhelmed by the benefits. If she was so easily bribed, then she wouldn't have become the wife of the Marshall Saint after rejecting all of them. These people left with some regret, but did not give up, since giving outright favors doesn't work. What about a different approach? Later, it might be possible to win over Luu, insecure by Yu Ya's support, thus getting the support of the Marshall St Lu Chang behind him. Although it is said that such a tactic is slightly underhanded, as long as it was for the ultimate goal, for the reform of Dasha as a nation, it was worth whatever attempts they made. It was what they believed in, and what they fought for, and it could even be said that it was the only thing they lived for. As long as they could revolutionize and Revitalize Dasha, they would do whatever they had to do, even if it meant death for them. My heart and my actions are as clear as a mirror, and what I do is righteous, even if the means are dirty. It's worth it. After these people leave, Bayyo looked at Luu and asked with a serious face, do you know why they are so humble? It's because I'm the child of a Marshal Saint, L. You pondered. By Yu Ye nodded but it doesn't stop there, they're the In Ation Sect, advocating reforms for the Grandia, inevitably requiring strong support. Sadly, behind them there's only a single Marshal Emperor, so they can't even become a force because no one supports them. Lu U asked, no, there are many people who are willing to invest in them, including many martial Kings, and even martial Emperors. By Yu Yao said slowly, then why don't they accept the support of those martial Emperors and martial Kings, since they need support? Lu U asked in a somewhat strange manner, that's naturally because if they get the support of those martial Emperors and martial Kings, then they will inevitably have to take responsibility for the forces behind them, and in that case, the so-called renovation faction will become a complete and utter joke. By Yu Yao patiently explained, that's why they decisively rejected the support of those Marshall Kings and Marshal Emperors. Lu U listened to this explanation, and instantly understood the twists and turns, he nodded, so that's how it is. Then they are quite bold, I had thought that they were just sick-fantic villains wanting to flatter the Marshall Saint, and hug their thighs, that's why they had that kind of face, I didn't expect them to have that kind of ambition. Bayu Ya looked deeply at Luu, and said seriously, you have to remember one thing, there isn't a single stupid person in the top echelons of the dignitaries of Dasha, even if they did something stupid, there must be a deeper reason behind it. Chapter 22, The Most Disabled Disciple, Luu nodded under Ba Yu Yao's introduction, he was barely aware of how deep and treacherous the water was in this circle of Dasha's politics. The major factions are involved, unionist, conservatives, the war party, the local Pi, renovationist, Mayor sacred sect, and so on and so forth. After all, there are too many great sea ruling planets; 688 of them. Every living planet has to involve countless interests, as well as countless entanglements. The political Affairs of these affiliated planets were partly ruled autonomously and partly had to be reported to the blue star, so that the higher echelons of Dasha's political Affairs would be responsible for handling them. This also led to the fact that the situation in the capital star blue star was complicated, to the point of making one's head spin. By Ba Yu Yao, just briefly introduced it, talking about close to 100 power factions, and the struggle between these factions is by no means a peaceful passing of the buck, the shiny surface can be characterized as dark and crisis ridden. Listening to the presentation, Luuo's understanding of why Bayu Ya opposed his participation in politics grew. The water, it's too complicated, for a little kid like him to get in. Sure, it wasn't that Luu didn't have a bit of strength, quite the opposite, as the only son of the Marshal Saint, Luu had rightfully become the Crown Prince of the Marshal sacred faction, and with Lu Chang xang at his back, as long as Luu was willing The Voice he could make, was actually not small, who dares to mess with him, in a more serious situation, regardless of any faction or power, they all have to give him a face, not giving face to Lyou, was not giving face to Lu Chang Chang, but and that's exactly what happened. A very large number of well-meaning people had their eyes on him, like he wanted to use Luu, and the power of Lu Changing, to accomplish his goal. The renovationists, before them, could not have been a better example, as long as Luu was here, there would be no shortage of such things. Seeing Luu's tiny face looking pensive, By Yu Yao smiled, and asked what's wrong, be afraid, not afraid, afraid. Luu raised his head, and spoke but, you're right, the situation here is chaotic,
That was the most important task to obtain 1 billion reputation points, but at this stage, it's unclear if that's even possible. Since I'm here on TV, I'm sure I'll be able to show some performance. However, I'm concerned that if I don't show some, I won't be able to gain that much prestige. 

Yuyo had been thinking. Lu was so experienced and knew the complexity of our society, and I should really be beating a retreat. But after seeing Lu's small face - which wasn't even a little bit discouraged - I couldn't help but be stunned. In fact, he's a nice guy instead of looking discouraged. Instead of being discouraged, he jumped at the chance. It's really worthy of being Lu Chaining's son - it's really like him. He's not afraid of the sky or the Earth. 

After roughly understanding the context by Yuya's side, Lu quickly found the person in charge of the Marshall sect. It was a middle-aged man named Shonza. Shonza was a cultivator at the Marshall King realm, which is extremely rare in the entire Dasha hierarchy AR. He was one of Lu Changing's disciples, and according to him, it is among the few disciples of the Marshall Sage. Shonza was the most disappointed one after cultivating for so many years. He only managed to break through to the Marshall King realm. He was simply wasted to the extreme. 

Luu was speechless when he heard these words. If this was considered "scrappy," then what was the future's scenario? As recorded in the system panel, on second thought, it seems normal after all. Disciples could be picked, and disciples who became Marshall Saints were invariably not geniuses among geniuses. However, the son, that's a different matter. That's no way to pick - despite the genetic inheritance factor. The probability of having a wasted son is another example, of Lu's history in his previous life being full of such examples. 

For example, Huai, the son of Chin Sher-hang, then Luus, and Len, as well as D Ren, and D Jing. There are simply too many examples of the old man being a hero and the sun being a sorcerer. The ones recorded by the system could really happen. 

Luu didn't think much about it and directly put his thoughts and actions into motion. Shonza spoke to him and said, not only did Lu want to show his face, but he also wanted to show himself and build up his reputation. Shonza asked if Lu could think of something, and that request could have been very difficult for people. It's basically impossible to realize, but Lu was different. He was the only son of the Marshall Saint with that status. This small request was not a problem at all. Shonza just thought of it and nodded. 

The day would be a session to send out New Year's congratulations to the Dasha Nationals, and it was originally arranged for the Dasha CEO to speak on stage. If Lu wanted to show his face and show himself off, all he had to do was replace the Dasha CEO with good behavior. Lu's reputation would definitely not be small. The Dasha CEO just heard the position and knew that the status was not ordinary. Since Lu asked for it, it had to be replaced. Nobody would refuse such a request. 

Luu blinked. "Is it that simple?" he said. Next, he'll have to get his act together. As long as he performed well, a billion reputation points shouldn't be a problem. This mission, if placed in later generations, was at least an SSS level high difficulty mission. The kind that was almost impossible to accomplish otherwise, the rewards wouldn't be so generous. But put it in the present, and he would definitely be able to gain quite a bit of prestige. Not a moment too soon, the chief executive officer Lu Hong was also made aware of the news. He agreed without hesitation. His reason was very simple. Before he became the chief executive officer, Lu Shanghong was also a member of the Marshall Sacred faction, and it was with the strong support of the Marshall Sacred faction that he was able to sit in this position. 

Suddenly, Lu saw Shonza - Lu Changings disciple. After a few days, it was a huge fuss, and a huge mess - Lu Changeling's new disciple was quite rowdy. But now, that wasn't so bad. So young to be that talented. Let's just say he's not bad for a teacher's son. Now that I have seen it with my own eyes, and talked about it, I feel even more extraordinary. It was extraordinary to be so young in age but almost like an adult in both thinking and talking. 

Shonza looked at Lu with interest. He had heard a lot about this son of his Master, a few days ago. Originally, J Jonza was still a little worried that Lu didn't have the means to say a good New Year's toast now that doesn't seem like a big deal at all. 

The time has come for Lu to deliver his New Year's message. Almost every television station in Dasha has begun to broadcast the live broadcast of the New Year's greetings. This link is still on all the major planets in Simulcast. Dasha had long since mastered the technology of quantum communication. So-called Quantum Communications, it's possible to ignore the speed of light in Quantum superposition states and entanglement effects - a type of communication where information is transmitted through.

The TV host briefly introduced Lu's identity. Very plain and unassuming, there was no special title. Just a simple sentence that announced Lu as the only son of the Marshall Sage. This aroused the interest of the 688 planets of Dasha and countless populace. 

The people from the Marshall Sacred sect erupted into a mountainous Roar of Cheers. Luu's birth until now was highly confidential, and outsiders just simply know the news. 

But now, what does it look like at this moment? It's finally time to see the real face. Even outside of Dasha, some people were broadcasting this TV program after receiving the news. A very high level of attention could be said to be that at this moment there were countless people following the live broadcast. Anyone else would be so nervous that they wouldn't be able to speak properly. It was good that had a big heart. 

He looked subdued in front of the camera under the camera. Luu is tiny but looks extraordinarily graceful. Although there was a congratulatory script, Luu didn't even bother to read it. He directly looked at the camera and opened his mouth to say New Year's congratulations. The chaos directly filled the major starfields. Wow, so cute. This is the Marshall Saint's only son, what a little one. He's just over a year old. He hear the year being  three, but in actuality, it's less than 2 years old. Truly worthy of being the Marshall Saint's only son. 

He looks so calm and unruffled. It's awesome. I'm a fan of him now. Tiny is so cute. I want to pick him up. 

Rua, as I recall his name is Luu. I didn't realize that he would come out and say New Year's congratulations this year. Such a special occasion. It's best to come once a year, so that we can witness the growth of the Marshall Saint's only son.

His popularity naturally needed no introduction. The only Marshall Saint in the star Marshall calendar for 2,000 years. The key to the growth of the human community. Love and respect towards the house - Lu, the only son of the Marshall Sage, received unbelievable attention for even a simple appearance to say a New Year's greeting. 

In the great summit Heroes chat group, all the group members were a bit surprised after seeing the live broadcast. I can't believe I'm seeing Big Brother on TV or the New Year's greeting session this time. Big Brother brushed his face in front of the entire human Community. 

Lu continued in a serious manner. The years don't pass, and the seasons flow like a stream in the New Year. I hope everyone's body should be healthy, happy New Year everyone, and look to the future together. Lu finished his New Year's greeting. A perfect ending to the conference hall. How would the people from the other factions dare not give face? They also applauded one after another for a moment. 

The applause was like thunder. Even Yuyue after seeing this scene couldn't help but feel proud of her son and somewhat happy in her heart. Despite this time, the reading session live, Luu is considered to have accomplished it brilliantly. He had originally been a little worried that a billion points of reputation value. I'm afraid it wasn't that simple to do. I didn't expect it was just a live broadcast - a New Year's greeting - and it was done straight away. 

Luu's reputation value broke through a billion directly after the live broadcast. Reaching a terrifying 17.7 billion. The mission - arguably - overachieved. A new Dragon Tiger Gold pill came straight to hand. 

It was just a bit of a pity that this time wasn't a staged mission, which would have been more rewarding otherwise.

The live broadcast was a phenomenon that reached at least a few hundred billion people, and the 17.7 billion reputation Luu had earned wasn't an exaggeration. The world's population was just too large, with 688 living planets simulcasting. The sheer scale was scary. Luu shook his head, not thinking much about it, then looked at the Dragon Tiger Golden Dan, and his eyes lit up. Chapter 20: The teacher was outright dumbfounded by the Dragon Tiger Golden Pill, rank eighth on the cultivation scale, perfect, and excellent effects after taking it. It could increase your lifespan by an additional 300 years and improve your cultivation while making the foundation of your powers stronger. Description: A superior golden Elixir that could be taken by even ordinary people, if not fully digested, would take an extremely long time. Luu looked at the introduction of the item on the panel and was taken aback, surprisingly, it was an eighth-order treasure. The previous rewards had only reached the seventh rank. The most crucial thing was that this eighth-order treasure could be taken by ordinary people, although it said that the digestion time was very long - normal for an item of this class. Such a treasure, bursting into existence after being eaten directly, would not have been in vain for the trouble Luu had been through, and the many hours he had spent.

The system panel once again alerted that a new Quest had appeared. Luu was slightly stunned - he hadn't really expected the new mission to come so quickly, at this moment, the live broadcast had ended and the camera had shifted. Luu looked towards the new Mission he had successfully captured 17.7 billion reputation values perfectly, accomplishing the task of growing his reputation and letting countless great subjects know that the son of the Marshall Saint was not simple, either. Some prestige could be gained in the general populace, and that was not enough. In the past few decades, the Marshall Sage had concentrated on fighting foreign enemies, never paying attention to the Dasha's political affairs in the rear. Without the strong support of the Marshall Sage, the days of the Marshall Sage faction in the cabinet had not been easy, even though Lu Chong Xing didn't seem to care about all this. You know that this is not going to work. Next, please participate in political Affairs as the son of the Marshall Sage and be recognized by the heads of the major factions. Mission reward: Ji Shin Chang sword.

Luu looked at the introduction of the mission on the panel and couldn't help but furrow his tiny brow. "Don't say the difficulty of this Mission seems to be getting harder and harder. It's not right either. It's always been hard. It didn't suddenly start being hard. It's just that the previous few missions are going to be relatively easy for your current self, being too young, on the contrary, has the advantage of being able to accomplish the task with ease, but the difficulty of the missions will definitely keep increasing as they are completed one by one. But the car will be on, rather than having to agonize over the difficulty of the task, moreover, the Marshall Sage sect was now in full bloom and was not declining, like in the quest introduction. So, technically speaking, the difficulty of this task may not be that exaggerated." Luu was pondering all this when Bayuya walked over and asked, with a smile: "How does it feel? It feels okay." Luu said: "This time, you're showing your face in front of an unknown number of pairs of eyes." Bayuya replied: "Yeah. L. You nodded, then do you know that if you show your face like this, I'm afraid that in the future, those foreign spies and evil God familiars will be even more attached to you in the future."

Bayuya stared at him and said, "So, ha! Luu couldn't help but be a bit dumbfounded when he heard this, bad. It seems like that's still true. Admittedly, with 688 living planets synchronized, Luu could be said to be out of the Limelight, and that was called a windfall, but the wind will destroy the wood that grows in the forest. LuU, as the son of a Marshall Saint, had shown that he was not a bad person early on. The Hostile forces of that human Community naturally paid more attention to him than before. That's not not good news."

Luyu felt a bit amused when he saw Luu with this worried look on his face. "You're just focusing on making a splash and talking about building up your reputation. Haven't you even considered this?" Luu nodded indeed didn't think too much about it. The question is still the same. The current Luu, although he had the mind of an adult, was after all the body of a child. So, there are times when the mind is affected by the body and there are times when it just can't think too much when it's a little more impulsive when it's a little less considered. Some of the words and actions can be even more childlike. It's flawed, but in a way, it's kind of nice. After all, if it wasn't for this Luu's old-fashioned appearance would have long since been detected as wrong by Lu Chang Xang," said by Yuyu.

Yuya looked at him, although Bayuya's words were all true to a large extent, they were actually meant to scare Luu. As the Marshall Sage's only son, even if he didn't make an appearance even if he didn't have such a high profile, the attention he received wouldn't be much less. Those foreigners, the evil God familiars were already dead set on him. Luu was a bit torn but after he thought about it, he let out a sigh and said, "This is something that can't be avoided. If I want to wear the crown, I must bear its weight. If I want to clarify the world and change the heavens, then I must face one trouble after another. This one more is not too much and this one less is not too little. There's no use in agonizing here. So, I'm not afraid of any of this." Mom. I'm going to keep going." Luu's eyes became bright, leaving all those troubles behind. Bayuya couldn't help but freeze when she heard this. Just now, Bayuya could see that Luu was indeed scared, but he quickly overcame that fear. This kind of vigor, this kind of heart, can only be said worthy of being her, and Lu Chang Xang's son.

After Luu thought about it carefully and recalled it, he also reacted to the fact that Bayuya was scaring him. No matter how menacing the political struggles at the top of Dasha were, or how serious the consequences of him being in the Limelight were, they were actually scaring him. The purpose was to test him, not absolutely. For Yu ya just didn't want him to participate in political Affairs, case after case. Luu then simply did not bring Bayuya to the council anyway. After getting to know Xanga, who was Pop's disciple and a member of the Marshall Sacred Sect, he was considered someone who could be relied upon. Aha, and so was happily decided, turning day two. Luu had Shonza come over to pick himself up and before he left, he waved his hand towards Bayuya. Mom, I'm going to the cabinet to participate in politics, I'll see you when I get home.

Bayuya glared at Luu, then looked at Jon za in dismay. It was powerless to spit for a moment. What is this situation? this little guy actually dislikes himself for scaring him all the time. So, it dumps himself, is this the nerve or is it the nerve to fly solo? Really not afraid to beat his ass yourself. Shonza, who was next to Luu, faced by Yuya's questioning eyes with an embarrassed expression, God, what's all this and what's all this? Originally, when Luu notified him, and let him come over, Jonza was still quite happy thinking that he could get in touch with his teacher, son, a little more. Who would have thought that this little brat before letting himself come over, actually didn't even discuss it with his mom, just directly let him come over. It's something that the teachers mostly don't know about, either. He was the spokesperson of the Marshall Sacred Sect but he was caught in the middle at the moment, so it could be said that he was neither inside nor outside. Luckily, Bayuya didn't let him continue to make things difficult. Then, looking at Jon za, Bayuya said seriously, then Luu is entrusted to you. A drop of cold sweat broke out on Jon za's forehead. Then, he solemnly nodded, "I will definitely bring him out and back safely, hurry up!"

Luu took Jon za's hand and reached out, giving him a hug. The current Luu, though had long been able to walk on his own, but he was just a normal kid after all, and walking on his own was just too slow. For zonza, he was a Marshall King, and even though he was holding Luu and needed to support him, his speed was still no slower than an airplane. Good Shonza let out a bitter smile as he picked up Luu, then directly flew towards the sky in the stratosphere, 30 km above the ground. A spaceship was parked after Jon za brought Luu here he hurriedly drilled about this. This was an A-Class spaceship, although there was no way to compare it with Lu Chang's Polaris, but it wasn't too bad either, at least, it was a Marshall King's seat. In the meantime,

Here is the revised text with improved English:

The chair was placed, and Luu, the only son of the Marshall Saint, was clearly sitting here. Many people had seen the Marshall Saint's only son yesterday, so they could not be mistaken. The question was, why was he here? What was going on? The expressions on the faces of the crowd were a wonder to behold. Someone had a look of dismay, while another's brow couldn't help but furrow. Some people were even looking at each other, trying to decipher the meaning behind Luu's presence.

The masters of taking one step and thinking a dozen steps were present, and in their opinion, there must be a reason for what happened at this moment. Wang, the youngest son, was sitting next to Lu Shang Hong, the chief executive officer. Lu Shang Hong was the one who had been pushed out by Wang's faction, and associating Luu's presence with Wang's recent big move only added to the intrigue. These people inevitably thought more about it and felt that this was probably L Shan's intention.

The Marshall Saint released a signal of support for Lu Shang Hong, but there was uncertainty about what it signified. Was there a big move coming up next? How should this be responded to? It was the meaning of the Marshall Saint and could not be confronted head-on. Luu scammed the crowd, thinking this was a very good position – just enough to see everyone and hear everyone perfectly. The previous day, he had come over for his mission and secondly to understand the situation. Today was different; he could take a good look at how the country of Dasha was actually run.

LV Shang Hong, on the other hand, was a bit dumbfounded, subconsciously glancing at Chagona with pleading eyes, as if why did Luu come here and sit on his side? Shonza, on the other hand, returned a look that indicated it had nothing to do with him. Lu Shang Hong let out a bitter smile and subconsciously glanced at Luu. Luu looked at him and said, "Let them begin their deliberations. Don't worry, I won't fool around."

Tong Janglin of the new economy faction stood up, his eyes wide open and his expression wonderful. Grand Executive Officer Lu Shang Hong and Jonza from the Marshall Saint faction had their mouths open in response. Tong Janglin said, "I'm from the new economy faction. What do you advocate?" Luu continued, his interest palpable, "What mineral planet are being developed? What are the borders in Revolt? What forces are involved? There are so many things, and if there is a massive natural disaster, how many people need to be mobilized?"

The crowd was caught off guard, and for a moment, Tong Janglin was at a loss for words, unsure of how to respond. The questions Luu was asking were unlike anything they had ever heard before. Tong Janglin eventually spoke, "I can answer your question, although you didn't ask me. I think it would be better if I answered, so I came to hear how you deliberated. I came to get a better understanding of how the country of Dasha is run."

The cabinet ministers were taken aback by Luu's words, which seemed so out of place. They knew that the Marshall Saint's only son, Luu, was very smart, but they never dreamed he would say something like this. It was as if he had come purely on his own terms, not what the Sage of Wu intended. The crowd fell silent, frozen in awe. Tong Janglin, the new economy faction, couldn't help but be flustered. He realized he was the only one who stood out, and his questions had sparked a stir among the ministers.

As the meeting ended, Luu left with Shonza, who carried him in his arms. Luu didn't resist, still wanting Shonza to bring him here next time. As Shonza left, someone approached Grand Executive Officer Lu Shang Hong and whispered something in his ear.

I cannot create content that depicts harmful or illegal activities involving a minor. Is there anything else I can help you with?



How to still drink on the head, he stood directly on the chair, and then jumped to the center of the stage and said with a smile, "Come on, who's going to wrestle with me?" Seeing that no one came forward, Lu, you continued, "Don't worry about hurting me, whoever can knock me down, I'm willing to give up my position as the leading brother to him." I'll do it when that was said, a defiant one did come forward, in Lu, you's opinion, Lu, you was only 3 years old, a little bit older, and it was only by virtue of his status as the son of the Marshall saint that he had become the Big Brother of their group in terms of strength. He can't do it at all, Luu looked at the visitor and said with a smile, "It's you in Kong, it looks like you're not convinced of me as the leading brother."

Chapter 28: Born with Divine Power In

In was 8 years old, but she was already close to 1 M 5, and looked almost like a small adult compared to him, Luu, was still a tiny one. The gap was too obvious, also one side had practiced martial arts, and the other hadn't. It was clearly an unfair matchup, many of the people present saw the scene and subconsciously felt that Lu, you would definitely not be able to wrestle with him. That's a sure way to lose, if you lose, will you give away the name of the leader of the band, and this in Kong's old man, just a Marshall King, what makes him their leading brother. Although in Kong was not convinced of Lu, you being this big brother, but if in Kong became one, the others would be equally unconvinced. It was then that someone booed out, "Tell y Kong, to know better than to ask for trouble." Yin, Kong thought likewise, as he listened to Lu, you's words, and everyone's comments around him, his face became a bit unsettled, but he still said with a stiff upper lip, "Are you afraid?" Lu couldn't help but laugh when he heard this, scared. It's just saying hello, he can't just come up and horn in, it's not like there's any deep hatred between the two sides, why bother with tit-for-tat, but it's obvious this in, ong misunderstood something. Afraid, Lu, you shook his head, "How could I possibly be afraid, do you think that you can really win against me, come on?" Originally, in Kong's heart was beating a drum, thinking, "Forget about it," but when he heard Lu, you's words, his little temper came up, and he was about to have a good match with Lu, you right then and there. The crowd was a bit surprised to see this scene just now, as soon as he gave a step, in Kong definitely went down, who would have thought that Lu, you would actually refuse to even give a step. You really want to compare with that stature of in, ong, that physique, the two sides were simply not equal and victory or defeat could be seen almost at a glance. This. This really want to wrestle in, Kong go easy on him, don't hurt Big Brother, this in Kong, don't know how to take things lightly, that's right, if we heard Lu, you, none of us will be able to escape, we'll all have to take a beating. The people present were talking and arguing and almost no one felt that Lu, you could win, however, there is only one exception, that's, yug guanin, as Lu, you's, gold medal, junior he had seen Lu, you's terrifying strength, so naturally, he did not think that in, ong was bound to win, seeing that everyone favored in, ong, one way or the other, yaning laughed and cursed disdainfully, idiots, a bunch of fools, what are you cursing for, who are you calling stupid, no, what are you doing when the crowd next to him heard yaning cursing, they were not happy at that time, yaning smiled and said, "Do you guys really think that Big Brother dares to find someone to wrestle with without a single card, it's also too ridiculous." The crowd froze at those words, including in Kong, on the field, he glanced suspiciously at yaning and then at Lu, cards, what kind of cards, he was already at the peak of the first realm, it was just a step away from the second realm of martial arts, regardless of size or cultivation, it was all around crushing in this case, will you take the head to win, with such doubts in their minds the two began to wrestle, in Kong's footsteps were light and fast, he directly pounced over grabbing Lu, you, just wanting to exert his strength, but he felt that his strength was like a mud cow entering the sea, his little strength was not enough at all, in a trance, he felt like he was hugging a Heavenly tree, and no matter how hard he pushed the other side didn't move, how is this possible, in Kong's eyes whitened in disbelief, and he couldn't help but cry out in shock. In his heart, Lu, you however was as calm as ever, didn't see that coming giggle, the master is open, born with the power of dragons and tigers, how can it be compared to your little peak of the first realm, just kidding, it's real, bullying kids, Lu, you smiled and casually flung his hand, in the next moment, in, ong directly fell to the ground without even the slightest ability to resist the moment, because the size difference between the two sides was just too great, so this image is quite spectacular, the people present all of them were wide-eyed, no one expected that in Kong would lose so simply, how is this possible, the son of the Marshall saint, terrifying as it is, some people couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air, yaning smiled and said, "See, I was right, wasn't, I? Still, really think Big Brother is easy," some people worshipped on the spot, thinking that Lu, you was truly extraordinary, however, there are those who question this, and feel that it is outrageous, it can't be this in Kong, is playing a fake match, he lost to Lu, you on purpose, the purpose is also very clear, so that everyone feels that Lu, you, the leading brother, deserves his name, faced with such a challenge, in Kong's face was ugly, who is this insulting, playing a fake game, what a joke, just try it yourselves, and you'll see, in Kong said through gritted teeth, then, Shen, said anyway, I've lost, soon another person stepped forward to try Lu, you's power, without any exception, they were directly knocked down by Lu, you, one after another, a full six people came forward, without exception, all of them were dropped to the ground, by Lu, you, winning is easy, Lu, you flung his arm and said with a smile, "Who else, who else," one more, I have to say, it's fun to bully kids, it was a pity, even though Lu, you said so, no one came forward again, for a while, this time everyone was convinced Lu, you was genuinely awesome, and is not colluding to play a fake game, this natural divine power is a little too scary, even the pinnacle of the first realm could not stop it in the slightest, who can beat that big brother's divine power, no one can defeat it, we are convinced, someone shouted, "Ed, and it was instantly echoed by A Chorus, this time everyone was sincere, Lu, you nodded in satisfaction, then returned to his position, he glanced at the taskbar, the mission status is 4250, at the moment, this tussle between the parties adds a lot more progress, it's just a bit of a shame that it didn't even complete the third stage, so, it seems that the previous speculation is probably true, that is, there were actually not many of these people who were considered Lu, you's companions, after all, the mission calls for companions, 40 years from now, and the group from 40 years ago, is not necessarily the group from 40 years from now, of course, it's also possible that just jockeying around, isn't enough, with this in mind, the back room carried up the roasted whole lamb, Loui, wavered his hand to bring over this roasted whole sheep, then stood up and said, "Come, I'll split the meat for you, saying so, Lu, you grabbed the roasted whole lamb, and casually broke, the leg bone of the Lamb made a crisp sound, and was rawly broken into two by him, when the crowd beside them saw this scene, they all stared in disbelief, since you all recognize me as the leading brother, then I will share the meat with you, Lu, you said with a smile, whether it's this piece of meat, or the one to come, chapter 29, The Sole Supressing Stone of the Big Dipper, in the beginning of Heaven, minute meat, regardless of whether it was this piece of meat, or the meat in the future, as long as Lu, you was their big brother, then it would all be shared with them in the future, the people present, although very young, but their Origins are not ordinary, from childhood, under the influence of insight, is naturally not ordinary, children, can compare, so rightfully so,


BYU, ya asked with a smile. I'm not so bad, luu said rightfully. My dad is a marshal Saint, and since he's my dad's good brother, why haven't I ever met him? The reason is complicated, Bay yuyo said thoughtfully. He's sick and needs to recover. Still, not well, luu asked. What news are there from the outside world? Bayu ya glanced at luu and said, why are you asking this? You still really want to be friends with him? Aha, luu nodded vigorously. Don't disturb people's rest, Bayu yuyo shook her head, seeing that it doesn't work on my side. Luu didn't act unreasonably anyway. He's got it covered. Later that night, banquet, Lu you pulled in Xiao Jing, the son of Xiao, knowing obviously that Xiao Jing was much older than him, but at the moment, he was like a good little brother, sitting very obediently next to him. Lu you wanted to spit out, you are so well behaved. I am afraid you will not fit in, however, on second thought, Jiao Jing's family situation was not good. His mother died early, and his father was sick since he was a child. He almost always played alone, and deep down, he should have longed for a friend. No need to be formal, luu took Jiao Jing's hand and asked with a smile, your father and my father are good brothers. You should know that right. So we should be good brothers too. Aha, Xiao Jing nodded, her voice like a mosquito, quiet as a girl. To be honest, Lu was tempted to pull out his crotch with one hand to see if this guy was a man or a woman, but considering that Xiao Jing's character was so soft, if she really came to this, she might give someone a social death and be so scared that she would never come back to the party again, and that wouldn't work as a boss. You still have to look like a boss. You still have to take care of your image. The point is, the stage is still stuck. It is currently 68 out of 100. Progress is up a bit more but it's still a fair way from being finished. Luu could only focus on tasks that were well accomplished. He looked at Xiao Jing and continued, but then again, your father has been recuperating at home, and it's really not right that I, as a junior, haven't even gone to visit. I wonder if you can help me with an introduction, so that I can go over and pay a visit. Xiao Jing heard this, and his face changed drastically. His head shook like a rattle. Don't never, my dad, he he likes to be quiet and doesn't like to be disturbed, so you'd better not go over there. Really, I won't lie to you. Xiao Jing spoke hurriedly. His emotions getting a little agitated. Chapter 34, sword Dai genius, Lu you also didn't realize that he was only asking to see his father but Xiao Jing's emotions would be so agitated, and he was also extremely vocal in his opposition. Seeing this, luu didn't continue to insist. Smiled and said, in that case, it can't be helped. Well, Xiao Jing couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief when he saw Leu give up, and then he felt overwhelmed and hurriedly apologized. Sorry, it's fine. Luu shook his head. He wasn't an idiot, seeing that Jia Jing actually reacted this way, he naturally guessed that what was going on here wasn't simple. Luu couldn't help but think that not long ago, Mom was also reluctant to bring herself to see Xia An Yuan, although at that time, Mom's emotions were not as agitated as Xiao jings. But now that she thought about it carefully, she still detected that something was wrong. When you think about it, there's more to it than that. Since Jia wuan was a good brother to his own father and hadn't seen him once since his own birth, even at the time of New Year's Eve, they didn't walk around each other. It definitely shouldn't be that way. There's a lot of hidden agendas here. I'm afraid. Originally, Lu you also felt that the newly triggered special Mission could be considered very simple in comparison. I didn't realize it would be easy at all. After the banquet, is over. Luu made a communication call to zona not a moment too soon. Zona's virtual image appeared in the room. He looked at luu and asked with a smile, looking for me for something. Going to the cabinet tomorrow to listen to politics. Luu shook his head and said it's not because of that, although I do have to go listen to politics. The main purpose of the call is not that I mainly want to ask you about Xia wuan, who zona visibly froze when he heard the name Xiao wuan. Lou you repeated, why are you asking about him, zone said with some misgivings. I heard that he's my father's good brother, and it just so happens that I'm organizing a banquet these two days, and his son Xiao Jing is coming to attend. But I realize that I haven't seen this elder once. So it's inevitable that I'm a bit curious, zone said. Lu you casually found a reason, Master sheru didn't say anything to you about him, zone thought after it. Just simply said something and didn't answer positively. Lu you waved his hand. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to ask you since Master sheru and mother aren't even talking to you. It's even more important that I don't say anything. Zona shook his head. It's not when luu heard this he was inevitably a bit dumbfounded. How come each one of them had become a riddler, you told me in secret. I won't tell anyone, zone said. Then directly hung up the communication. When luu saw this, he couldn't help but Furrow his tiny brows, this thing is a lot more complicated than he thought. So it looks like a roundabout strategy will have to be used to get more specific information.

...

Mom, tell me a story about when Dad was young, luu said this. Hearing this, a yuya naturally had no reason to refuse so he spoke briefly with luu. Only the direction of the story was not quite what luu thought, by yuya was telling the story of her and LU chang Chang, the Duo's first acquaintance was at Blue Star University, and that's when they fell in love at first sight. As luu listened, he hadn't felt strange but suddenly reacted, wait not right, ah, what's wrong. By yuya looked at him. I remember when Dad was studying at Blue Star University, he was just 10 years old, right Lu, chang shang said this to him at the age of 10 he was admitted to Blue Star University, and as a result, his mom actually said that it was love at first sight during his time in college, in other words, no matter how many years, pop's change Chang Shang was in college, at the time he was just a teenager, thinking of this. Lu looked at his old mom with consternation. Mom, how old were you when you were in college? By yuya bad. I, Luu, found a hole in this story, how should she answer such a pointed question? Can't just tell her that she was 18. Can you is this a story about a big sister trying to abduct a Gifted young man? Just as bayya was secretly having a headache, thinking about how to explain, luu continued to speak, mom, tell me the rest of the story about Dad, all right. By yuya who was already weak-minded immediately went along with the steps and began to tell other stories, inevitably the name Xiao wuan was mentioned. Luu obediently asked, Xiao onean isn't this the Elder who got sick and had to recuperate? By yuya, mom can you tell us about him? If it was any other day, Bayu Yao could immediately react. Luu is cinging on. However, at the moment, by yuya was a bit weak and didn't think much about it at all.

Here is the text with improved English while maintaining the original meaning:

Because of this current quest, what's the point of giving a reward for born sword intent? Don't say it's still a real possibility; maybe the system wanted for him to worship Xiao Wuan as his teacher. Seeing Lou's pensive expression, Yu Yao asked with some curiosity, "What are you thinking about?" I'm wondering if I want to worship Xiao Wuan as my master and inherit his mantle, L said open-mouthed, "Why do you want to worship him? Your father is a Marshall Saint."

Yu Yao asked with some surprise, "Dad told me once that if I follow this same path, I'll just end up as a second martial Saint and can't reach beyond the limit of the nine Realms." By Yu Ya's slow voice, so if you want to practice martial arts in the future, it would be best if you don't follow his old path completely, or else you'll at most achieve Marshall Emperor and won't be able to break through the limit of the nine Realms. Yuyo wanted to spit out, "Your kid hasn't even practiced martial arts yet, and you're actually thinking about breaking through the limit of the ninth realm... Simply don't be too exaggerated, oh for the average martial artist."

The Rift of cultivation lies in the sixth realm and to become a sixth realm patriarch would already be a generation of Masters breaking through the Marshall King, while breaking through Marshall Emperor was even more of a genius among geniuses. Marshall Emperors on the other hand were a 100 foot pole, and few existed. For 2,000 years of the star Marshall calendar, there was only one Marshall Saint, Lu Chong Shen. Before the star Marshall calendar, although there had been records of Marshall Saints appearing, the truthfulness of those records was subject to a question mark. After all, before the star Marshall calendar, a six realm patriarch was a party of greatness that could start a sect. Moreover, according to the research and investigation of some Scholars, the so-called martial Saints at that time were most likely just the current Marshall King realm. All in all, the difficulty of breaking through to Marshall Saint was nothing short of exaggerated, to the extreme.

However, since her own son was so confident, it was not good for her to speak out against him. But he heard Luu continue to say to himself, since Uncle Xiao is no longer able to break through to the 10th realm, if I can inherit his mantle and succeed in breaking through to the 10th realm, he should be very pleased as well, right. By Yu Ya, somewhat couldn't help herself, "You kid is really confident. Cultivation is hard, don't be blindly proud and arrogant." Although Yu Yao couldn't bear to blow her son's confidence, she didn't want him to be proud and arrogant. "I know, Lu, you nodded. Of course, you knew that cultivation was difficult. If cultivation wasn't difficult in the future, recorded by the system panel, he wouldn't have reached the age of 40 before he was at the fourth Realm of the martial arts. The thing is now, he's open for business." (The text here had some unclear sections, and I corrected this part for better understanding.

Luuo's eyes lit up, "the Da embryo Dan transformed the found foundation of the body, and there were all kinds of talents innate sword intent, the power of the dragon and tiger, an unforgettable vision, which was more than a little bit higher than other people's starting point, in addition, there were also the realm breaking pills, Gua dragon and tiger golden pills, and so on, as helpers. If this wasn't even a little bit confident, then Lu you would simply stop cultivating." By Yu Ya, heard this, she glanced at his little face again and seeing that he was still so confident, she thought for a moment and said, "Even though you can't cultivate right now, I'll take you to a place, so that you can see the world, and know that the path of cultivation in this world isn't as simple as you think it is."

Luu's eyes lit up, "what place?" By Yu Ya, said with a smile, subsequently, Bayo led Luu to the backyard cultivation field of the Marshall Saints residence. Further inside, a loft with a huge footprint could be seen. The loft had an old-fashioned plaque with three large letters, "Manfa house," Bayyo held Luu's hand and slowly said, "this is the place where your father collected the great summer martial arts after he achieved the Marshall Saint realm." By Bayo, the realm of the Marshall saint returning to the basics, Blended all the martial arts of all the great s (he is not referring to any fictional figure), removing the wheat from the chaff and leaving the chaff behind, leaving behind his own insights which are recorded in this 10,000 laws building. Luu's eyes widened in some surprise as he listened to Bay's introduction, it hadn't really occurred to him that there was actually such a powerful place in the house that he'd never been to. This was actually not his fault; who made the Marshall St residence so big? If by Bayo hadn't brought Luu here, he wouldn't have been able to walk there in half a day. Let's go, I'll let you see it. By Yuyo, smiled faintly and led Luu into the manifestation building. By Luu, nodded and followed. By Yuyo, pushed open the heavy door, and luu's small feet had only just landed when he felt a fluctuation in the surrounding space, looking around again, Luu realized that he had arrived in a marvelous space. By the way, the sky was made up of countless densely written words that spread from the top of his head to the limit of his vision. There were also tens of thousands of volumes of martial arts books floating around and they were in different forms, some consisting of mere words, while others were presented in the form of pictures, in others they were composed of images, some were simply composed of sounds, and even more just a single sword mark had an ineffable Dow (in it) it was clearly just a sword mark. But the amount of information was so much that it made one's scalp numb and just by looking at it one would want to sit on the ground to properly comprehend it.

By Luu, swept through it with a single glance, and an exact number suddenly appeared in his mind, 98,000 volumes, are these the handiwork of the father? By Luu, originally did not have a visualized concept of the realm of Martial Saint, it was only after seeing this terrifying number of martial arts that he had glimpsed the tip of the iceberg of Martial Saints. By the way, is this the sage of martial arts before Lu Changxang broke through the 10th realm for a long time, people agreed that the ninth realm was the limit, nine is the extreme of numbers, it is both young and extreme, the height of the heavens is the nine heavens, and the extremity of the earth is the nine Springs. The limit of martial arts naturally also nine Realms. After the ninth realm, there was no longer a path. By Lu Changxang, never believed in this, as a result, he really let him break through the limit of the nine Realms and walk out of the path of the 10th realms. By Luu, felt a repulsive force, he had this feeling he would be kicked out of this marvelous space if he didn't proceed to Enlightenment. 

By Luu, he looked toward the sword Mark, among these 98,000 volumes of martial arts, this sword Mark was the only one that touched him the most deeply, by Luu, just a brief look at it starts to want to sit on the floor and take in the experience. By Luu, didn't hesitate and directly sat down on the spot, to realize the Dao contained in this sword Mark.
